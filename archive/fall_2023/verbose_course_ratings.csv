Out of all the classes I've taken at Harvard, this one definitely ranks towards the top. The content is extremely interesting, and you leave the class with a newfound appreciation for coalition building. Additionally, this class does a great job of using the struggles of other racial minorities/marginalized individuals to highlight why coalitions have been so powerful in American history. If you're looking for a great history/African American Studies class that examines prominent issues that have impacted Black people, then this is the class for you. Professor Eatmon is a terrific professor who genuinely cares about her students, and she's well–versed in the content. Must take class.",0.9858,"I would not recommend anyone take this course, as the classroom environment is hostile. Specific students are targeted in the course and are harassed for how they speak and for the contributions they make. It’s also listed as a discussion course, but Professor Eatmon simply cancels discussion.  This makes it uncomfortable to speak.The course provides no flexibility and Professor Eatmon makes it difficult for you to ask for an extension for assignments. She also tediously marks for attendance, including lateness. This matters more for your participation grade than what you actually include in the course.  She would rather students not come at all than come late or need to leave intermediately for medical for medical or other reasons. The classroom is not an open space. Feedback was met with pushback. I think we all hoped for acceptance and a place where discussion was allowed to occur. This was not the environment for that. Further, there is no flexibility in terms of lateness and extensions. This creates a burden for students who experience health conditions and family issues throughout the semester. As the course stands, several students were denied needed extensions for coursework for sickness, death, and other issues in their lives and their families. Class time was also used to stream full documentaries in the course. Because the Professor would not sleep or would otherwise not want to lecture, we would sit through documentary films unrelated to course material. There is little discussion of Jim Crow within the course even though it is described as a course about Jim Crow. We spent more time on present–day issues than history and  barely discussed Black history after Reconstruction.I would prefer to see a consistent policy on slurs in the classroom. Professor Eatmon full on said slurs against multiple groups in the class that were not Black.  Black students couldn't say the n–word but she would say multiple slurs.Further, the documentaries and high–school–level videos we watched were not applicable.  Professor Eatmon expects us to put her course above everything else in our lives, including our well–being and other coursework. Thus, she assigns hard to understand assignments and expects us to spend all our time on them.  To take this course, you have to commit to always being right on the dot for class  and agree with her in every class.",-0.9009,,0.0,220490,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,African & African Amer Studies,African & African Amer Studies,,Social Sciences,,Lecture,Jim Crow: Histories and Revivals

The pop quizzes are super annoying so if you're taking the class for a letter grade I would recommend a reading group. I would also recommend reading smart. The pop quizzes aren't hard. When it comes to articles read the introduction, read the conclusion, and skim smart (something I regret not doing). In terms of books, you could break up the reading. I think the readings are very interesting but very hard to do especially if you have other reading–heavy classes. I saw ""GEM"" in other course evaluations and I would have to disagree. Readings are super important later in the class when it becomes more discussion focused or else class is awkward. The sections were super fun and hands on. Overall, if you're taking it for fun like I was, I would recommend to take it pass fail (my biggest regret). Also the first midterm is very memorization focused. I would also recommend you answer the questions as you go or find a group to answer them as you go because if not the study guide becomes quite unmanageable. The final is a little easier if you've gone to most or all the lectures and have done most or at least half of the readings. Despite its difficulty for me, I'm glad I took this class. You learn sooo much. This class is also moderately DAO accommodation friendly. I would recommend communicating your needs throughout the semester (although communication can be hard).  Also remember to ask for extensions early if you need them. Also do the extra credit throughout the semester. Don't miss class because you can't make up the pop quizzes unless you have a good reason such as a doctor's note.

We also only learn about interesting stuff without delving into too many math concepts that we won’t ever come across again. The psets are very reasonable both in length and in content. Each pset consists of 3 parts: hand calculation, conceptual questions and proofs, and computation (matlab) questions. The proof questions are not too hard and he gives you hints. The computation questions also come with clear instructions and it’s generally very satisfying to see the application of the concepts we learned in class. And did I mention this class is 80% PSETS 20% MIDTERMS (and both midterms are open notes)? It’s such a great class to learn interesting concepts without having to stress too much about grades/tests.

He gives you hints for the harder questions, and you won’t need anything outside of what is taught in class (no need to read the textbook, but if you want to, that’s great). Just make sure you pay attention to when Sholmo goes over the pset questions in class because he doesn’t publish pset solutions and there are no practice exams.

You assign yourself your own grade (though you must be very honest with it). With that being said, how much you get out of this course is a function of how much time you put in. Out of the AM distribution courses, this has been my favorite class. There are 2 quizzes and they are exactly like the class worksheets/psets. So as long as you review and fully understand the worksheets and psets, you will be TOTALLY OKAY (there’s also a cheat sheet). The psets aren’t the hardest, just go to OH and work with a partner and you will be fine, the skill checks are super easy and make sure you are keeping up with course material (you can retake the skills checks and Sarah gives you example questions – so you are guaranteed a 100%). The final project was honestly a grind, but that’s because it was hard to reproduce a paper – make sure you choose a good group and good paper/project (and START EARLY – you have an 8 page individual paper).

I felt like, from beginning to end, each class made a reasonable jump that pushed the course content forward while also building on foundations from previous classes. Because of this, I felt like I really understood the content by the end! I also thought that the workload was very well distributed across the semester. Quizzes and pset due dates alternate weeks, so each week feels like it has about the same amount of work. In general the workload was on par with a good pset class–– enough to do sufficient practice with the material but certainly still manageable. It was really nice that quizzes were distributed throughout the semester as this made each one feel much more manageable and less stressful than a big midterm and final. If you're interested at all in the topic, I definitely recommend this class! I came away feeling like I could genuinely set up and solve real–word problems with optimization, which feels like a super useful and applicable skill.It is important to think about the format of the class, which is somewhat flipped classroom. We had readings that we were expected to do before each class along with a brief reading check. We would then do problems as a group in class. Personally, I found it most useful to skim the readings and do enough to answer the reading check, then go to class and work through the problems (which were useful in going through the content), and then return to the reading after to actually take comprehensive notes. Finally, I just wanted to say how lovely Margo is! You could tell that she genuinely cares about the students. Throughout the class, she made a few adjustments to the schedule to better tune it to the group and make sure our workload was at a good level, something that I always really appreciate about a professor. I definitely enjoyed taking this class.",0.9977,"Getting behind in this class is fatal. It is imperative that you do pre–class assignments on time, attend office hours if possible, and participate every day in class.

There are a lot of assignments every week which do take a pretty decent amount of time, but the solo attempts for all of these assignments are graded on effort, and accuracy only after discussing/reviewing/correcting with group mates and TFs. Putting in effort and making sure to do accurate corrections will pretty much guarantee both an A AND a good understanding of the material, which I tend to think is rare at this school. I cannot emphasize enough how crucial it is to read the entire syllabus, especially the part about how grading works and the letter grade breakdown based on the scores you get in the class (learn how the virtual tokens work, what to do if you don't get a 2/3, etc.) BEFORE the class starts because it moves fast and the grading is super different from any other class I've heard about.

You will not learn anything. You will be inundated with busy work every week and realize in the end that you learned not a thing the entire semester.

Yes, this is definitely an ""easy A"" physics premed course like you can get not study and just complete the assignments to get by. But he literally does not teach anything. And we all know you cannot truly learn by reading and annotating a textbook. All the accompanying assignments (tutorial, challenge, Readiness Assurance) are so tangentially related to what you ""learn"" from the textbook. This reveals a large knowledge gap and shows that we're not ""learning"" enough from the textbook to answer basic physics problems. Additionally, the grading system in this course is ridiculously confusing, unnecessary, and weird. Also the emphasis on group projects makes this class extra unbearable. You work in 3 groups (randomized) during the semester, and it can truly make or break your experience. If you don't work well with your group, you can find yourself dreading doing all the assignments, especially the project report. They'll trip you up and say it's easy to earn an A but they can literally drop your grade down to a B literally just for missing a single assignment so be careful. You will not learn *anything* in preparation of the MCAT if you take this course. And if you have no physics experience prior to this course, everything will just be extra confusing for you. I took this course over the PS2/3 series because I wanted a chill semester where I wouldn't be scrambling for my grade at the end of the semester.

You're supposed to have questions and you're supposed to want to answer them and try and figure them out yourself. And that takes time! You've gotta collect all that data, which takes immense time and patience because the sky moves simultaneously too quickly and too slowly, and then you have to actually figure out how you want to represent that data in a way that you can actually draw conclusions from it and then you have to go and DO that and then you have to figure out how to adjust your model of the sky accordingly. My favorite part of the class was measuring things and being surprised and learning things for myself through experimentation and you just can't cram that kind of thing. This is not some easy QRD–requirement–meeting–class (I've heard PSY 1900 is the class for that), this is an journey! It's a whole adventure! It's amazing!

Is it practical for your daily life? I mean, if your life is really really cool, then yeah, but statistically the answer is gonna be no. Are the discoveries you're making particularly groundbreaking? No, people in the middle ages had a firmer grasp on some of this stuff than you will and the field as a whole is considered by many to be obsolete. Is it the kind of class you take strictly because you're amazed and full of wonder and you just want to learn for learning's sake and pour countless hours into something you find fascinating, even though it's not going to advance your career or esteem or whatever else people are so caught up about? YES. And I think we need more of that, you know? Take a class because you think it's cool and for no other reason! Pour time into it just because you're curious to find out the answer for yourself, even though you could totally just figure it out immediately with a cursory google search. Experience wonder again.

I took it as an extra elective as a BME concentrator, but I suggest it for anybody interested in neuroscience, research, or technology and its applications. The focus of the course is the technology and methodology that has progressed the field of neuroscience, but we often discussed the biological principles as well. A background in biology and circuitry is helpful , but more necessary for biology than circuitry in my experience. I did not have much electrical engineering background and was able to follow along and learn about what was relevant to understanding the lectures. I found Professor Liu to be very friendly and an engaging lecturer and the TFs are very helpful and timely with grading. The course staff is flexible and understanding and greatly takes into account the student's time and preferences. Classes were mainly structured a lecture/seminar style with a lot of Q&A and discussion. As an undergrad, it is helpful to have grad students in the course who contribute a lot to the discussion and ask great questions. Professor Liu was able to answer a lot of our questions and hypotheticals with a satisfying and in depth answer, even when the conclusion of the research was ""we don't know yet"". Assignments were not a stressor for me at all. The journal club one page responses and presentations were on very interesting and crucial publications and did not take more than a few hours at most to do. It was a low stakes way to continue developing comprehension and analysis skills of scientific literature. The midterm and final presentations were similar in purpose to the journal clubs, and Professor Liu only wanted us to engage with and understand the most important papers in the field and he made it clear that it was not supposed to be stressful, and it wasn't.  As with every group assignment, it is definitely easier when the whole group is committed and timely. Make sure to NOT GO OVER TIME during presentations, since that's effectively the only way to lose big points. The final paper assignment is not too bad, but if you have never written a grant proposal or literature review before, it would be helpful for you to brush up on it. The course does provide examples and criteria though.  IMPORTANT NOTE: I took this course after it was not offered for a while and more people  than expected enrolled, meaning the staff was not able to accomodate everyone in the lab which was added that semester. Normally both lab and journal club assignments are required but they gave our class the option to do one or the other which made the time commitment significantly lower for me than it might be in the future. With that said, the lab is a very interesting and exciting part of the course, and even though I chose the journal clubs because of other heavy classes, I do wish I had the time for the lab.  Also, it was nice that I was able to grab flyby lunch before/after class at the SEC, and I happened by a lot of free food and events after leaving class.",0.9983,,0.0,,0.0,216486,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Biomedical Engineering,Biomedical Engineering,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Neuroengineering

In my opinion, the two keys to being somewhat successful in the class are paying attention in section and doing every last practice problem you can get your hands on. Section was soooo helpful for me because my TF had a great grasp of the material and really wanted to help us nail down the concepts. The practice problems they give you in section are so so necessary for doing well on exams, etc. Do them over and over and over again, and then go online and find more practice problems to drill. Honestly, like 65% of the exams is just being able to recognize mechanisms you've studied and apply what you've memorized from drilling problems over and over again. Smaller things to make sure you're attentive of: 1) doing all the psets (they're mostly graded on completion so it's nice to have that free 100 from your pset grade) and 2) paying attention in lecture and writing down most (if not all) of the notes; it sucks, but it really makes a difference in understanding the material, and unlike in most other classes, you'll end up reviewing your notes a lot, so it's definitely super helpful to have clear references to go back to. The exams are...fine; they're fair. Definitely study hard and early for the first exam because in hindsight, that was the easiest of the three and I could've done better if I'd prepared earlier. Definitely study early for every exam, though, but honestly, studying for exams is easier if you've been drilling practice problems every day. Practicing every day is honestly the most important key to this class.",0.9972,"This class was discouragingly difficult and fast, and in my opinion lived up to its reputation of being a ""weed–out"" class. I did love the teaching staff and how supportive they were, but I don't think I would recommend it unless you are required to take it or are really interested in chemistry. It's really stressful and if you don't have the time to put into practice problems and review on a daily basis, you will likely not do well unless you already come with a strong background in chemistry.  I had a very weak background and fell behind from the very beginning, which is probably why I had such a poor experience. The actual homework load is fine, but it is not nearly enough to prepare you for exams and you have to treat the practice problems as if they're required work too.",-0.8904,,0.0,115137,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Chemistry & Chemical Biology,Chemistry,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Principles of Organic Chemistry

Chem major or not (if you need to take orgo for pre–med for example), take this class!! Professor Myers is a wonderful lecturer and the teaching staff is great. This course is definitely difficult and will require a lot of your time. There's no getting around that. There's a lot of material covered and Professor Myers often goes through lectures at a very fast pace (to the point where if someone asks a question, he either advises them to speak with him after class or answers the question but we stay 2–3 min late after class because there is just no time). The teaching style worked very well for me, it was a traditional ""professor lectures at the board for 75 min and you take notes"" which I'm used to and sections were great for catching anything I didn't quite get in class. Though Professor Myers may seem intimidating, he really isn't and genuinely wants to get to know students and just teach fun things in organic chemistry. Problem sets were certainly difficult and you can't do them without going to office hours. But it's usually manageable to complete the whole pset after 1  two–hour office hour session if you start the pset beforehand and only come to office hours with questions. I can't speak to how helpful the PSLs are since I didn't go to their office hours after unhelpful experiences in chem 20, but TF office hours were extremely helpful. The teaching staff in general is very supportive and receptive to questions. Exams were sometimes fair, sometimes pretty difficult. You definitely need to study hard for them and you should probably make peace with simply letting the rest of your life take a backseat the 5–7 days before exams. There is however an alternative grading scheme which drops your lowest exam and replaces it with your final exam score which can help if you had a rough time with one of the exams (this was Exam 3 for most people this semester).  Lecture Integration problems were great for reviewing material that was covered recently and keeping it fresh, and they're basically free points (add up to an extra pset grade and they're grade based on completion) so do them!! Also PLEASE go to review sessions! They are ""optional"" in the syllabus (attendance isn't checked) but they are so great for reviewing the material and working on problems to really cement your understanding of the material. Professor Myers takes time out of his schedule to host the review sessions and works through the problems with students at the board which is incredibly helpful ( a little embarrassing sometimes if you are standing at the board for 20 minutes as your synthesis is being reworked, but SO helpful!!). Exam questions are also sometimes pulled STRAIGHT from the review session packets so at the very least go to them to be prepared for potential exam questions. The final was very fair (this year and in years prior since previous finals are given to us as practice finals) and I feel like represented the course material and the class itself quite well. You have to study a lot and put the work in, but it is certainly possible to get very high grades on exams and psets and be very successful in the class. Lab was alright, 4 hours is tough but the TFs tried to make labs fun and also get us out early which was very very appreciated and made the experience much better than it could have been. This class made me excited to potentially take advanced orgo in the future and I am certain that I had a better experience in chem20/30 than I would have in 17/27.",0.9985,"It's a hard class. Even if you are a genius used to taking 6 hard classes each semester, don't do that with Chem 30.  I watched multiple peers try that and fail. Assuming you are required to take this class, here's what I wish I did on a weekly basis:1) Have a complete reaction sheet from Chem 20 at the beginning of the semester for quick reference.2) The evening after each lecture, write all of the new reactions from that day into a running reaction sheet.3) The day after each lecture, do the lecture integration problem. 4) Start psets at least 2 days before they are due.For exams, here is what I wish I did to study:1) Rewrite all mechanisms for reactions within the unit2) Write a ""how to make"" sheet for each functional group (e.g. How to make esters: include all reactions that have an ester product)3) Do a practice exam4) Redo all lecture integration problems and pset problems5) Do the synthesis sheet they give out for exams6) Do 2nd practice exam.I promise if you actually do this, or a similar routine, you'll be ok.

Overall a great class with a kind course staff that I'll look back on fondly!",0.9801,"I learned a lot about ""why"" chemistry happens the way it does and how to think about reactions/mechanisms. That being said, there was a misalignment between what is taught in lecture and what is emphasized on exams. Exams focused heavily on mechanistic analysis, but because of the lack of office hours, practice problems, and sections dedicated to lecture material, we didn't get nearly enough practice with the kind of analysis required on exams. This ultimately left me dissatisfied and frustrated with the course.",-0.8658,,0.0,109454,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Chemistry & Chemical Biology,Chemistry,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Advanced Organic Chemistry

LPSA is a phenomenal introductory course to chemistry and biology, which everyone should take regardless of their background in these subjects. Coming into this class with only knowledge from AP Biology, I initially felt overwhelmed with the amount of chemistry I was learning, but with time I became accustomed to the workload and looked at science in a way I never did before. It is important to note that this course is not heavy on memorization (even though it may seem like it at times) instead, it teaches you how to apply the knowledge from class to word problems and questions you might encounter in a scientific setting. The layout of the course consists of three lectures (MWF 9:00 am–10:15 am), a section (1 hour and 15 min long), and a lab component (3 hours max although most labs only take 1 hour). There is one PSET due each week on Monday at 9:00 am, a pre–lab quiz due on Monday at 9:00 am, and a lab report due on Friday at 9:00 am. This all may seem daunting but to be honest, the workload is VERY manageable. There are three exams and a final exam and I can't stress this enough but DO ALL THE PRACTICE EXAMS. The tests are very fair and if you do the practice exams you will know what to expect since they are of the same format. They host review sessions every week before the exam and have a multitude of help rooms you should attend. The course for the most part is chemistry (2/3 of the course) and then switches to biology (1/3 of the course) at the end. Both Dr. Tucci and Dr. Matchacheep interchange, so one will teach a few lessons, and then the other will take over for some time. Dr. Tucci: –He is an enthusiastic man that makes this 9 a.m worth waking up for because he brings so much energy into the room. –He always encourages you to shout out your questions and will take time to answer them! – He tries his best to get to know you personally and will always greet you in the morning. –He holds one on one meetings that you can sign up for if you have any questions that aren't answered in class or after class. These are short thirty–minute sessions but he tries his best to get through everything that confuses you. Dr. Matchacheep: –Many people often approach Dr. Tucci for questions, but Dr. Matchacheep is always there to answer questions as well. Both are chemists and are knowledgeable in their own domains (fun fact she also teaches organic chemistry in the summer, so if you have questions regarding chemical interactions this is your woman!) –She will walk you through all questions you have and will always make it very interactive. She works each question step by step with you. –She is also willing to meet with you in person to explain concepts you might have not grasped (I spent an entire hour with her reviewing problems until I finally got them) –She walks around the lecture during learning catalytic questions, so even if you are sitting in the back you are able to ask any question you have.–She is very kind–hearted and will always respond to your emails with kindness, so please approach her! Both professors are great people and want you to succeed (I've spent numerous hours in their help rooms asking questions I had before exams). Don't shy away and always reach out for help! This is a very manageable course and it will pay off in the end.",0.9974,"This class is not impossible, but it's not an easy A. The tests are difficult, but if you study (and I mean seriously study) you will be fine. Do the practice tests, and make sure your psets are correct. The labs aren't difficult, and often aren't the full  period of time. Go to the lectures and pay attention because it's hard to catch up if you fall behind. The first half of the course is chemistry and the second half is biology.",-0.8275,"TAKE LPSA!! I loved my experience in this class and I learned SO much from Gregg and Sirinya. Definitely take over LS1a – so many first–years told me they hated LS1a. LPSA is so much better taught, Gregg is an absolute gem, and the class is so much nicer on your grades. They want you to succeed and offer so many opportunities for extra help (e.g. converting lowest prelab score to full credit if you fill out a learning survey).

Personally, I haven't, but after having taken Complit 153, I think I have an idea of what it must be like. In an opera, a singer comes on stage and performs some piece of music with tremendous passion, and although you have no idea what they were saying, you still nod to your friends, say it's good, and applaud because you appreciate the art of it. Similarly, in Complit 153, Professor Weir enters the lecture hall, talks in highly elevated diction for an hour and a half about some sophisticated–sounding topics, and although you have no idea what he's saying, you still try to jot down notes and nod to your friends because you appreciate the art of it. But what exactly is this art? It is the art of quoting from other scholars: When he explicates an interpretation, he makes sure to include as many sources of Nabokov scholarship as he can. He often always throws in a dash of Russian as well, just to add some interlingual insight. It is the art of improvisation: Arrive early enough and you will get a sneak peek of Complit 153 behind the scenes. Fifteen minutes to 6:45, Prof. Weir enters the premises. Five minutes to 6:45, Prof. Weir walks in and flips frantically through all 60 pages of his notes. At 6:45, Professor Weir begins his performance. It is the art of speed: Prof. Weir always has many more notes than he has minutes in class, but they don't call him the ""master chef"" for no reason. He always cooks up an incredible stew, expertly blending together scholarly ideas, usually relying on the last 10 minutes as a speedround to ""popcorn"" from person to person as they collectively crowdsource just about every insight to be had. It is the art of abstraction: His handwriting is illegible. But most importantly, it is the art of the simple: Behind the facade of the multilined model with thousands of different facets, there's always a really simple Nabokovian principle. Some of my favorites include: all art is flawed art, unless it's Pushkin's or Nabokov's; Freud is awful and any character who agrees with him is awful; nature (especially the butterfly) is beautiful; and of course the hermeneutics of perversion. Comparative Literature can be so wonderful. This was my first comparative literature class at Harvard, but after taking it, I became confused as to why people call comparative literature majors ""losers,"" unless a loser is just someone who wrestles with a text long enough to extract an insight about the world.In all honesty, this class has topics that are really interesting, but they are often presented in a way that blurs the fine detail and focuses on the big themes instead. I am a fan of the post–lecture 1–hour class discussion where we consider the artistic and political aspects of the text and this part is usually pretty well–done, even though the conclusion will be something obvious (funny). Lectures themselves often move too quickly as a result of the large number of literary buzzwords that are not explained in much detail (and time taken up by the class discussion). It is unfortunate that there is no textbook because there is no way to explore the material presented in class and get a better understanding except by combing through the books Prof. Weir quotes from, which are usually behind a paywall. Essays are pretty good both as a learning tool and in terms of content (they usually remind me of something from popular culture like Queen's Gambit or Stanley Kubrick that we then compare with the novel), although I wish the page length on them was just a little more high. I feel uncomfortable when I take notes for an essay and I am able to fit my notes on only 3 lines (with the paper in landscape orientation). In–class pop quizzes seem unexpected at first, but they actually happen just about every week an essay is due, so it's hard to be unpleasantly surprised. The weekly workload varies wildly, since Professor Weir assigns either most of a 200–page novel in addition to a two hour movie or just a couple pages' worth of selected excerpts to reread. He put the weekly homework on the course page weeks before we had to do this and this was actually what we did, leading many to be very happy. As a result work is pretty predictable, so don't be too sad if you don't have time to get it all done one week, chances are you can catch up in the week following.If you want to take this class, make sure you know a bit about Nabokov, make sure you know your Russian early–20th–century politics and Russian idioms, and that's basically it. It's quite accessible really, once you actually find it in the course catalog.",0.9982,Nabokov is brilliant but his perspective might startle you,-0.1406,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

I wasn't expecting to enjoy theoretical CS at all, but I found a lot of results/concepts from this class really intriguing and unexpected (e.g., Rice's theorem, Y combinators, PRGs, Turing machines, etc), especially as someone who came into this class without any exposure to theoretical CS. I'd definitely recommend at least considering taking 121 – I know that CS 120 has become a much more popular option now that enrollment for that class isn't capped, and while 120 probably does a better job of preparing you for tech interviews than 121, I think that CS 121 introduces you to some really interesting concepts that aren't covered in 120 (e.g., PRGs, etc).That being said, 121 isn't without its own flaws/differences – unlike MIT's TOC course, CS 121 uses Boaz's textbook, which still contains some typos and takes an unconventional approach to TCS. I thought that starting with NAND circuits and generally taking a more circuit–based approach was interesting and insightful, but I know some people who say they really would have preferred the standard approach to TOC covered in textbooks like Sipser. I also felt a bit lost at the very end of the course when we covered quantum computing – I think it was covered a little too quickly and assumed a little too much from the students wrt how much they would know about quantum notation/theory.I still think the pros way outweighs the cons though: 121 is really interesting to begin with, and it's clear that Boaz cares a ton about his students and how well they learn the content in the class. There's so much extra credit in the class on psets and exams that it's super easy to get a 100 under psets (capped at 100) and its very doable to get 100+ on exams. CS 121.5 sections (where they invite profs and postdocs and the like to give related lectures) are super interesting (would definitely recommend trying to go to a few, even if you're unsure if you'll understand it all!), and 121 sections in general are really useful for pinning down the content. Problem sets are also interesting – they do a really nice job of tying course content together, and the results can be really insightful.If you're on the border of trying 121 out, I'd go for it! Definitely would have regretted not taking it this semester!",0.9981,"This class has an unreasonable participation requirement, a useless textbook, incompetent TAs, and a professor who does not care enough to supervise his own exams.",-0.819,,0.0,119064,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Computer Science,Computer Science,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science

The only good part of this class was learning from Cynthia Dwork, who is clearly a true genius. However, all the other parts of this class (especially the EXTREMELY LAZY TFs) ruined it. I think the professor should have done something to keep her staff accountable after multiple students complained when it became clear that the TF and CA were being intentionally lazy and trying to avoid their responsibilities, by scheduling only 1 hour of office hours per week at 12pm on Wednesday/Thursday (which students couldn't even go to). Additionally, the materials for the course were very lacking; there are no course recordings and the lecture slides are not really readable since they have too little information on them. Finally, the problem sets were very hard (and TF/CA are inaccessible), and feedback took forever (more than 4 weeks in one case). Additionally, I felt like the law school joint classes were disappointing, maybe because I expected to learn something legal but instead just had to listen to law school students blab about their own personal experiences and opinions. Also, for some reason even though this class was at 9am which was bad enough, it was decided that the joint classes should start at 8:45am on Mondays... That being said, I thought this class did a pretty good job at exposing us to ethics in CS and those considerations, although not really the legal side of things.",-0.5003,,0.0,204972,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Computer Science,Computer Science,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Fairness and Privacy: Perspectives from Law and Probability

If you're thinking about taking the course, do it! Find some friends to take it with you, clear space in your schedule, and deep dive into the course. It's definitely worth it; don't be deterred by any reviews. A few reasons the class stands out:1) Stratos and his lab are some of the most chill, yet cracked people I've ever met—just look at the awards they win. This translates to easy–to–understand lectures and a good introduction to research. Lectures teach you how to walk step–by–step through the different operators you learn about, as well as how to break down any high–level database concept into the fundamentals: cache utilization, branching, etc. (I would suggest taking CS 61 before this course; I will note that I found the project easier than the psets in CS 61). Furthermore, doing database research is comparable to the work you do in lectures.2) You learn how to code—independently. Unlike in CS 61, where the projects were contained to 1–2 weeks of work, no one besides you in this class (not the TFs nor Stratos) will know your entire database implementation because you'll be working on it throughout the semester. Besides the handout code—which you can revamp to your heart's content—you decide which functions to create and how they work, how to parse inputs, and how to return results. Attending lectures should provide a rough outline for you to follow, but besides that, you learn how to debug your code. (Please, please, please install Valgrind immediately after starting the course. I promise you'll save 2 weeks' worth of time you'd otherwise spend debugging weird errors and dealing with memory management in C. You can either launch an EC2 instance or run it through Docker). Modularize your functions, unit test new operators, and spend time thinking about the high–level concepts (you should really only spend 30% of your time on this project actually coding); this project isn't bad once you realize how to break a big task into a collection of smaller ones. 3) The grading is very generous with extra credit, namely, on the midterms. You don't need to sweat your grade!",0.9906,"I think this class was my favorite cs class I’ve taken in this school. Every lecture was so eye opening and I to my own surprise absolutely loved the content.However, I also think that this is the worst performance I’ve had in a class. The project is insanely hard. I got stuck for weeks in a row at a problem caused by one line multiple times throughout the semester and I was not able to finish the project. You’re going to love it when you actually are able to implement the crazy things in your project. But more likely you’re going to be extremely frustrated at everything for 3 months straight.I don’t regret taking this class (said assuming I don’t end up getting a failing grade) but also the project was the biggest mess I’ve ever seen.",-0.9476,,0.0,119249,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Computer Science,Computer Science,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Data Systems

Lectures were well organized and I learned a lot about Pytorch, python, AI paper layouts and presentations, different ML tools like weights&biases, hydra, etc... Looking back at my previous classes, this was by far the course where I gained the most hands on experience, and probably the most practical in terms of how the skills would transfer to industry. You definitely learn how to put together a research paper, and how to look for new ideas from existing papers. I think the greatest thing I got out of the class is being able to digest AI papers and understand the high level approaches, and now being able to go and build my own pytorch models. The majority of the class was great, and the assignments didn't take too much time and allows you to regurgitate the material. The main pain point of the course is the final project, where we had to try and improve upon the performance of Pranav's chex x–ray classification model CheXZero. That was the main goal of the project and we had to come up with our own ideas and approaches. Overall it was a cool idea, but I think it was too broad and unscoped, and many of our initial attempts failed. This was especially annoying because running the code would take a very long time, so a lot of time would be spent just waiting to see if an idea could work. Additionally, CheXZero was recently published in Nature and it seems really hard to do something groundbreaking that would improve upon the model within a few weeks, especially when our AWS accounts were resource–limited so we did not have the compute power to even get a model that could be directly compared with the original. I think overall there was very little guidance for the project and we were fumbling around in the dark just trying things randomly in hope that something stuck. Out of the 5 groups, I think only 2 ended up with something that had some small improvement, but it still felt like everything was very hacky.Overall it is a decent class, especially for being new. Pranav is super cool and has done a lot of amazing work. If you take this class you will definitely learn a lot, but be prepared to spend a lot of time on the group final project (groups of 3). It is a very back–heavy class as you probably spend at most 5 hours on each assignment, but the project will take a long time because of the time it takes to train and run the code.",0.9891,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

On top of this, I wrote about 1000 words of paper responses per class that followed a specific framework, and these were fairly useful in understanding HCI research but felt like a pain on top of other assignments. On top of that, we also had to do pair research every week, where we essentially got matched to other students on a website based on what we need help with that week, and help each other out for an hour before writing a response on what we learned. Once again, could be useful if it wasn’t on top of so many other assignments for this class alone. I did enjoy learning about user studies in HCI research and it was fun to execute one throughout the semester and for our final project. If you like to create cool side projects with different frameworks, this class is definitely for you, since my final project just felt like testing out a cool side project. It really caters to people who independently like to develop cool, useful interfaces. Just beware of all the busywork that is required.",0.9965,"The course assignments were too much. Having 2 things due Monday, 3 things due Wednesday, and 1–2 things due Friday was so undoable and defeating. The tier 1 assignments were at first cool to get to learn about different softwares/languages. The above and beyond criteria for that was unfair given how much work had often went in to even get the MVP running. When the tier 1 assignments started overlapping with Tier 2 and tier 3 it was very hard to balance. Tier 2 assignments were okay but had so little instruction or guidance that they became more annoying than a cool exercise. Tier 3 was confusing for everyone really until the last 3 weeks of the class. It was an added stress having been mentioned so early in the course. The pair research assignment was maybe the most upsetting of all. I get the teacher wanting to learn what areas it looks like people need help on. But, forcing us to then submit assignments on what we learned and then grade them was very unfair. Finding 30 minutes to meet was already a challenge, and a lot of times people made of random things to get help with. It was all the more surprising that after this, people could then get 15/20 points for having met with someone but not describing what was learned to the teacher's satisfaction. All of these combined made the class feel like more like a punishment than learning experience; students felt like they were in middle school, so distrusted to do the assignments that every assignment then had to be graded. It felt like there was no rest in this class or time for reflection.",-0.4376,,0.0,121985,Primarily for Graduate Students,Computer Science,Computer Science,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Research Topics in Human-Computer Interaction

However, I also learned that personally, the Fluid Earth just isn't something that I am particularly interested in (not necessarily a reflection on the course!). Don't come in as someone with a love for the outdoors and nature and conservation and ecology and expect to love this course at all. Lecture feels longer than it actually is. The professor is great, clearly a genius in her field, and can explain concepts really well one–on–one, but her lectures just weren't interactive enough to keep me fully engaged. However, if you have a genuine interest in most of the material, you might have a different experience. Sometimes, it seemed as if content was still a little unclear. Stephen, my TF, was a lifesaver in this regard (and in the course as a whole). Stephen is really great at breaking down complicated topics, is patient enough to explain material step by step, would go above and beyond in answering emails, staying after lab to answer questions, hosting office hours, would always provide helpful encouragement, and generally wanted the best for everyone. Countless times I've found myself understanding a topic I thought I'd never understand thanks to Stephen. In general, reach out for help, stay after lecture (the professor is better at explaining material then), start on PSETs early to make the most out of section and office hours, and you will be just fine. If this isn't a concentration requirement and you just happen to love conservation/broader material on climate change, take another course.",0.9955,"I took this class because I was interested in the topic being taught– the fluid Earth, ocean dynamics, and atmospheric science.

I wouldn't recommend it, but if you are to take it, be prepared to teach a lot of things to yourselves and leave lectures confused almost daily.

In the past, I was hesitant to discuss controversial topics in Chinese because I felt that I couldn't fully express the complexity of my ideas/perspectives with my somewhat limited vocabulary and sentence structures. After taking this course, I feel much more confident in tackling nuanced and sensitive topics, since I've learned grammar structures and vocab that can help me express my ideas clearly and elegantly.As for the logistics of the course, the teaching staff are absolutely wonderful as always. The lectures are so engaging and touch on many different topics, ranging from pop culture to international relations to Chinese culture, so you'll have many opportunities to practice different kinds of grammar structures and vocabulary. This course does tend to have slightly more assignments than 130 (discussion posts, reading, etc.), but the extra practice is well worth it. All of the assignments and tests are at an appropriate difficulty level; in other words they are difficult enough to challenge you and help you improve, but very manageable and can fit in a busy course schedule (for reference, I spent an average of ~5hr/week most of the time, maybe a couple hours extra on weeks with big essay deadlines).

The class is particularly diverse in the students who take it. My class came from a variety of the graduate schools, and even undergrad students had diverse interests and reasons for learning Japanese. I came in without having learned Japanese before, and although the learning curve initially is a bit higher than those who have been exposed to the language previously, I truly did not feel hindered or at a disadvantage. This was the most well–thought out, well–planned, course I have ever taken. You will be amazed at how much you learn each week. The quality and joy for learning that Kageyama sensei and our awesome TFs nurtured throughout lecture and section was truly incredible. Another important aspect of the course to note is that there is an abundance of additional resources that perfectly align with the course on the Canvas page. Take advantage of them! The textbook and accompanying app for audio (you can download it for free) matched lecture perfectly and were excellently prepared as well. I have never felt so supported in a course and unlike other courses where the book or reference material doesn't match class, all the units are very systematic and if you ever get confused or need clarification, the book is guaranteed to have the answers to your questions. The course staff also holds ""Nihongo Chat Hours"" every week if you want more practice speaking or just one–on–one time to review. The course is one you need to dedicate time to, but it will be a rewarding and fun experience. You'll see how deeply Kageyama sensei and your TFs are dedicated toward giving you an authentic, rigorous, and eye–opening experience in learning Japanese language and culture. They are some of the most professional and caring course staff I have had the pleasure of working with, and it shows in how much all of us in class felt we wanted to do our very best for them. Overall, taking Japan BA was an invaluable experience and it's one of those courses that has deeply impacted my continued interest in Japan and for other cultures in general.",0.9958,,0.0,,0.0,111193,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,East Asian Langs & Civ,Japanese,,None,,Lecture,Elementary Japanese

I didn't have a good understanding of microecon before (except for just knowing what supply–demand is), but this class definitely improved my understanding of it. I definitely recommend taking this class and I wouldn't worry about taking ec10a before this (unless you need it for concentration requirements).  The only math you need is knowing derivatives. I definitely recommend reading the book a lot since I mostly relied on the book to answer the MCQs and it increased my understanding of the subject a lot. I also recommend having a nice pset group that you can take the MCQ with since this year the quizzes were really confusing. Go to Office Hours for the LP and you should be good. They also had EQCs this year which are also helpful on top of office hours.",0.9865,"Do not take this class with Bockyo. Literally the worst professor.

If you don’t get one part then you can’t do the other parts??? What is that??? That’s not even testing knowledge. It’s repetitive and not comprehensive. Worst class. I got As in Ec10b and ec10a and econometrics and I think I’m literally gonna get a C because I couldn’t do one part of the final, which means I couldn’t do any of the parts on the question, which means 1/3 of my grade on the final is for sure knocked off!

This class consumed my life. Once i stopped caring about the psets (which for before the midetrm I went to OH to complete) and completed them on my own, my time dedicated to this class was better but not by much. The lectures are extremely poorly structured, hard to follow and there were rare moments where I actually derived anything out of them. The book (up until the midterms), CA lecture notes, CAs and (out of luck, thank goodness) my TF helped me make it through this class. The book covers content only up till the midterm which was extremely useful for building conceptual knowledge but post the midterm, as the content (in my opinion) got harder, that stopped and so did my attempt at trying to better undertsadnd concepts. The CA lecture notes post the midterms were extremely helpful as the slides in singularity are grossly ineffective.  My section was the only reason I could survived this class. My TF  singlehandedly carried the class and paced the sections in an excellent way, ensuring that students have a strong conceptual understanding of the concepts. I wish he could also have that influence on the lecture component of the class becuase if it was possible in sections to make the class appear well structured as he made it, I’m sure lectures could have been designed better too. The psets are unnecesarily hard, the modelling projects were nightmares. The lack of feedback on the same, the openendedess, ambiguity and lack of support (even the CAs did not have access to answer keys) made the projects AWFUL.  I survived the class and want to say that I derived great friendships and (some) apppreciation for the way of approaching economics via math but hoped that the class was better sturtcured for all my peers and I to have had an overall better experience.",0.9965,"Do not take this class. Absolutely terrible. Everything is unclear, you get no help, you will have to pull all nighters and consider leaving the exam half way through because you literally cannot start working on any of the remaining questions. You know it's bad when you see 50 students staring into the wall during an exam that is supposed to be extremely stressful. The midterm has 3 parts worth 100 points in total. One True/false/uncertain where you can get 24 points. You will likely get somewhere around 15. Then, there are 2 math problems where each question is dependent on the previous question. To get an A– on the midterm you needed 31. So yeah, most of us left the exam having answered the true/false and tried our best to get a few partial credit points here and there, leaving most of the exam blank because we could simply not do any of the questions. This is a very unfair way of testing. It meant that a few points made a huge difference. One true/false question would determine your ""grade"" on the midterm. There was almost no distribution since everyone left the exam mostly blank. I understand the value in having a difficult exam to be able to differentiate between all students rather than having an exam where everyone gets 100. But this is taking it too far. All the hard work and studying we put in was for nothing since we didn't get to show anything that we can actually do. I sat there and had done the true/false and then got stuck on question a/b on both math problems. I got so mad I wanted to just throw my exam in the trash and leave. so so so bad. It's rude. And the professor even seemed to enjoy it when he discussed it in class later. Yes, we get it, you understand this perfectly but there is nothing funny about students feeling miserable and failing their exams. FYI, I think I will get an A in this class simply because I happened to have taken an elective in one of the topics that happened to show up on the final exam a lot.

I was pumped about taking the course after reading the description but it sorely disappointed. The first half of the class is about Roland and his peers' research into injustice and discrimination in America. I respect their work and thought it was decently interesting, just be prepared that this is half the class and the midterm asks a ton of nitty gritty questions from deep in the readings. The second half of the class is about ""VC"" , and if you know absolutely nothing about the structure / functionality of VC / PE firms and are interested, it may help you connect some dots about how it works. If you already know a decent amount about that stuff, you won't learn anything new or interesting most likely. While I am really interested in VC / PE, the course is fully, 100% focused on IMPACT investing. So be prepared... I just personally think a lot of it is BS and I'd rather spend my time learning about how to actually make money and develop pure investment IQ and then hopefully use that to help people. That is just me though, if you are very interested in helping people over making returns, check this class out. The final is fun if you think of an idea you care about, but it's basically just a long pitch deck on a company you make up that has to be economically profitable AND have a social impact. The actual content of the class is not horrible by any means, but Roland and Jamina are horrible at managing this class. Our midterm format changed like 3 times and also neither of them ever respond / are helpful over email. Grade wise I think it is a tough class to get an A in. Will have to work pretty hard on the midterm and final for an A–, B+ is pretty do–able if you are somewhat competent. Overall, it's aight. Not the worst class ever, but probably not as good as what you're imagining it to be.",0.9974,"This class is SO DISORGANIZED AND CAUSED SO MUCH STRESS. I took the class because Fryer said there would be no midterm exam and that both the midterm and final were projects. But then he made the midterm a test, but he said it would be take home. then a days before the exam, he changed it randomly to in person no open notes– which is crazy . Then he retracted it and pushed it to a week later and made it in person and open notes, and then 2 days before the new exam, he said we will only be allowed 2 pages of WRITTEN NOTES– which is CRAZY. then he retracted it lol to be in person open notes. BUT THEN the exam was SO DIFFICULT AND NOTHING like what he taught in class. the modeling questions on the quiz were NOT taught in class, and you can’t do the exam with an EXCEL SHEET. most people got 50% on the exam (and FRYER said that it would be “SUPERRR EASY” and he wouldn’t give us ANY indication on how the exam would be). And then for our final pitch project, he said it needed to be 50 ish pages long, which is fine but he gives NO RUBRIC OR INSTRUCTIONS. It was so horrible (the class) and i don’t recommend it.

Don't let the Stata element scare you away — it's definitely not too difficult to learn, and you only need it for one question per pset. If you have questions about Stata or any material, make sure to go to the TF office hours (especially Salvador!! (I'd recommend Lucas too but he's graduating this year)). Prof. Pettenuzzo is also really helpful, and is very willing to explain any concepts/pset questions if you ask.Maybe the best advice I can give is to read the textbook!!!!

However, I wished that at times, we focused more on the big picture (i.e. applications) and were less focused on the mathematics.  I also think the Professor was another strength of the course. I thought that he presented information in a clear and logical way (and encouraged questions), generated enthusiasm for the class, and was very approachable.

You assign yourself your own grade (though you must be very honest with it). With that being said, how much you get out of this course is a function of how much time you put in. Out of the AM distribution courses, this has been my favorite class. There are 2 quizzes and they are exactly like the class worksheets/psets. So as long as you review and fully understand the worksheets and psets, you will be TOTALLY OKAY (there’s also a cheat sheet). The psets aren’t the hardest, just go to OH and work with a partner and you will be fine, the skill checks are super easy and make sure you are keeping up with course material (you can retake the skills checks and Sarah gives you example questions – so you are guaranteed a 100%). The final project was honestly a grind, but that’s because it was hard to reproduce a paper – make sure you choose a good group and good paper/project (and START EARLY – you have an 8 page individual paper). Overall i’d definitely recommend taking this class :) it was great :)if you put in your 100% you will definitely get a good grade. but if you don’t, then that’s up to you",0.9935,The psets are annoying but can help with understanding.

I felt like, from beginning to end, each class made a reasonable jump that pushed the course content forward while also building on foundations from previous classes. Because of this, I felt like I really understood the content by the end! I also thought that the workload was very well distributed across the semester. Quizzes and pset due dates alternate weeks, so each week feels like it has about the same amount of work. In general the workload was on par with a good pset class–– enough to do sufficient practice with the material but certainly still manageable. It was really nice that quizzes were distributed throughout the semester as this made each one feel much more manageable and less stressful than a big midterm and final. If you're interested at all in the topic, I definitely recommend this class! I came away feeling like I could genuinely set up and solve real–word problems with optimization, which feels like a super useful and applicable skill.It is important to think about the format of the class, which is somewhat flipped classroom. We had readings that we were expected to do before each class along with a brief reading check. We would then do problems as a group in class. Personally, I found it most useful to skim the readings and do enough to answer the reading check, then go to class and work through the problems (which were useful in going through the content), and then return to the reading after to actually take comprehensive notes. Finally, I just wanted to say how lovely Margo is! You could tell that she genuinely cares about the students. Throughout the class, she made a few adjustments to the schedule to better tune it to the group and make sure our workload was at a good level, something that I always really appreciate about a professor. I definitely enjoyed taking this class.",0.9977,"Getting behind in this class is fatal. It is imperative that you do pre–class assignments on time, attend office hours if possible, and participate every day in class. The vast majority of learning is done on your own and comes from thoroughly reading the pre–class assignments. Quizzes are straightforward and easy if you have a solid understanding of the concepts. Problem sets are difficult, and the extreme optimization project is the most difficult/worst part of the course. Utilize class time to ask questions because the office hours are limited and you will likely not be able to get a tutor at the ARC.",-0.5423,,0.0,156288,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Engineering Sciences,Engineering Sciences,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Introduction to Optimization: Models and Methods

The good things are that Lina and the course staff (especially Krithika!!!) are wonderful and are especially helpful and reachable. Lina was always so approachable and great at offering suggestions to help. The recommendations Lina made for final project after only a few minutes of consideration were spot on and helped us refine it; she truly has controls figured out. Krithika was such an amazing TF and was always quick at responding to my questions. She's so nice and I could tell her vast knowledge of the topics. I think you learn quite a bit in the course about control theory although I think it can go deeper, especially into the math. We never really saw proofs of any of the theorems we used in the course and I take issue with this. We should know more of what's going on and I wish Lina assumed that we had more mathematical maturity. For this reason I think the lectures could be better and more intuitive– lectures are ""required"" but I feel like I could read the lecture notes and the textbook without going to any of the lectures and have the same understanding of control theory. The textbook also had proofs of the theorems we used so I went there usually when the proofs were omitted from class which was most of the time.The final project was a strength of the course; it is not like other courses' final projects. You start this one the first few weeks of the semester. Every few weeks, instead of a problem set due, there is a final project milestone due where you work with your team on the final project and apply what you just learned the past couple weeks to the final project of your choosing. This is a wonderful idea and I'm glad this existed. When it comes time to hand in the final report all you have to do is fix up some of the project and maybe add some more things if you want and that's all–– because you've already done the core of the work for the milestones earlier in the semester. I think more courses should do this.There are a few administrative things which stressed me out a lot. There was a problem set (notorious, if you know someone who took this class, even last year or the year before, they will immediately know exactly which problem set you're talking about) which would have taken a few hours if it weren't for the stupidly high amount of tedious algebra the course staff insisted we do. No other problem set was like that. There was also the second midterm to be done entirely during the confines of reading period. This was a de facto final so I'm unsure why the staff decided to stress us out even more and have us do it during reading period. The final project was not so urgent as to necessitate pushing the ""midterm"" to be during reading period.",0.9684,"THIS IS NOT AN EASY CLASS!!!!! people might say it is easy but that is only for if you have already taken ES 152, MATH 21B, COMPLEX ANALYSIS, ES 156.

The material is engaging, it isn't easy given the higher level concepts, but it definitely is doable alongside other difficult classes.  The weekly work felt a little relentless possibly because OH were scheduled right before the work was due most of the time, so we all ended up cramming a lot of the work into the day before due dates, but the grading is nice, and getting an A is certainly not out of reach for most people.

It was a low stakes way to continue developing comprehension and analysis skills of scientific literature. The midterm and final presentations were similar in purpose to the journal clubs, and Professor Liu only wanted us to engage with and understand the most important papers in the field and he made it clear that it was not supposed to be stressful, and it wasn't.  As with every group assignment, it is definitely easier when the whole group is committed and timely. Make sure to NOT GO OVER TIME during presentations, since that's effectively the only way to lose big points. The final paper assignment is not too bad, but if you have never written a grant proposal or literature review before, it would be helpful for you to brush up on it. The course does provide examples and criteria though.  IMPORTANT NOTE: I took this course after it was not offered for a while and more people  than expected enrolled, meaning the staff was not able to accomodate everyone in the lab which was added that semester. Normally both lab and journal club assignments are required but they gave our class the option to do one or the other which made the time commitment significantly lower for me than it might be in the future. With that said, the lab is a very interesting and exciting part of the course, and even though I chose the journal clubs because of other heavy classes, I do wish I had the time for the lab.  Also, it was nice that I was able to grab flyby lunch before/after class at the SEC, and I happened by a lot of free food and events after leaving class.",0.9983,,0.0,,0.0,216799,Primarily for Graduate Students,Engineering Sciences,Engineering Sciences,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Neuroengineering

For the midterm there are several sections that could either be done weekly or handed in all together when the midterm is due; I suggest the weekly assignments instead of cramming everything during midterm season. While many take this class for gem purposes there is also an opportunity to learn a lot! This class did a great job in showing students the ins and outs of innovation.

The class is superb in every aspect, from the teaching to the guests to the assignments and readings themselves. Professor Pollan is at the top of his field in science journalism, and he generously shares his insights/advice with every student, from giving an insider perspective on how the journalism/editing industry operates to reading each student’s drafts and giving paragraphs of detailed feedback. We got the chance to speak with guests (experienced editors, writers, and scientists) throughout the course, getting detailed and diverse perspectives on every step of journalism, from reporting and finding sources to how to best craft a pitch. By nature of the subject, the class is very interdisciplinary and brings together students across the sciences and humanities in a very small and close–knit setting. If you are a student interested in both science and writing this is the class for you! We were exposed to breakthroughs and headlines in an enormous number of scientific fields, from agriculture to quantum physics. Simultaneously, we got to hone our journalism and creative writing skills through the “narrative” part of Narrative Science Journalism—careful thought must be put into constructing a person–centered story arc from the science. Apply to the class, even if you have little previous experience in journalism—as long as you have a strong background and interest in science and writing, Professor Pollan will make sure you are acquainted with all the conventions, strategies, and jargon of reporting/journalism. In addition, because it is a journalism class, be prepared to devote a lot of time outside of class to reporting: finding sources, conducting interviews, and traveling to nearby sites related to the story. The more time you invest in reporting and writing your story, the more you will take away from the class.",0.9906,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

Jill Lepore is a fantastic fantastic professor. She is so warm and generous with her time and advice. She creates a space for workshopping ideas and writing that is fun and inclusive. The only caveat is that it is a very self–driven course. Most of the class (slightly above 50%) is just workshopping your/peer projects. This means that you need to devote a LOT of time into the class!! You cannot turn up to class without having workshopped your piece. And there is nowhere to hide when a dozen others+prof is picking apart your work. It is obvious if you have not done the work you should have done. Everyone always hugely underestimates how much time creative projects take. Especially in audio form, you often spend many many minutes editing precious seconds, maybe even milliseconds. It takes forever!! If you want to develop your writing and your audio editing skills, you MUST carve out a significant portion of your time for this class. This will be one of your heavy classes! But you will get a lot out of the class if you put the effort in. You will develop a more discerning ear – you will just be able to hear more of the layers in the sounds of the world. Even beyond gaining a critical appreciation of audio media (e.g. podcasts, radio), I have found that I can hear more layers in the pop songs I listen to and pick up subtler sound details when watching movies or even just pick out bird songs a bit better when walking through the park. It's quite a nice feeling. You also learn to use Adobe Audition, which is a nice practical skill. tldr fantastic fun class but a LOT a LOT of time commitment",0.9942,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

But feedback on style is critical to becoming a better writer. Students in this class know to expect writing marked thoroughly with black pen, from the familiar brackets (meaning something like ""are these words necessary?"") to suggested rephrasings or thoughts on punctuation choices.

However, I also learned that personally, the Fluid Earth just isn't something that I am particularly interested in (not necessarily a reflection on the course!). Don't come in as someone with a love for the outdoors and nature and conservation and ecology and expect to love this course at all. Lecture feels longer than it actually is. The professor is great, clearly a genius in her field, and can explain concepts really well one–on–one, but her lectures just weren't interactive enough to keep me fully engaged. However, if you have a genuine interest in most of the material, you might have a different experience. Sometimes, it seemed as if content was still a little unclear. Stephen, my TF, was a lifesaver in this regard (and in the course as a whole). Stephen is really great at breaking down complicated topics, is patient enough to explain material step by step, would go above and beyond in answering emails, staying after lab to answer questions, hosting office hours, would always provide helpful encouragement, and generally wanted the best for everyone. Countless times I've found myself understanding a topic I thought I'd never understand thanks to Stephen. In general, reach out for help, stay after lecture (the professor is better at explaining material then), start on PSETs early to make the most out of section and office hours, and you will be just fine. If this isn't a concentration requirement and you just happen to love conservation/broader material on climate change, take another course.",0.9955,"I took this class because I was interested in the topic being taught– the fluid Earth, ocean dynamics, and atmospheric science.

I wouldn't recommend it, but if you are to take it, be prepared to teach a lot of things to yourselves and leave lectures confused almost daily.

We learned a lot, and Bryan is a really good teacher so it didn't feel like too much. And if there was something that you found to be less interesting, we would move on quickly enough. In addition, the course was very manageable as there wasn't too much work, and the work that we did have paired nicely with what we had been learning about.

The lectures are pretty interesting because Prof. Martin does a great job with teaching and keeps it  engaging, but at least half of the class was usually zoned out during the class presentations and they don't really amount to anything unless you're the one presenting. Section was good and crucial for doing the psets, as we basically just did parallels of the pset questions but with different values. It is, therefore, very easy to do well in this class. The other homework was in the form of reading a chapter of the textbook and submitting a discussion post about it before the class in which we were going to learn about that chapter's content.

The lectures are based on the textbook chapters, however, and I definitely did learn during lecture. Also, Scot is enthusiastic and accessible, and he's able to answer any question you have for him.

This course was excellent, as it both vastly improved my writing and gave me a deep understanding of the philosophy of friendship. Through her lectures and feedback, Jen taught me how to express my ideas in a way that was concise and easily understandable for my readers. She continually emphasized the importance of ""writing for the reader,"" which is a concept I plan to apply in all of my writing going forward, as this style of writing allows me not just to share my ideas, but to convince my audience of my ideas.  Jen was also very accessible, and she took a great deal of time and care when giving me her feedback on my essays–––her comments really set me up to succeed.Another major strength of this course was that Jen made it very easy to understand difficult concepts. Some of the reading in this course is difficult, but after each reading, Jen fostered illuminating discussions that enhanced my understanding of the text. She welcomed student input, and many times when I didn't understand something, I actually ended up learning it from one of my classmates. Jen also always made herself available after class to talk through any outstanding questions I or my classmates had.Many people see Expos 20 as just a requirement, but this was actually my favorite course this semester. The only problem with it is that it doesn't last for more than a semester! The content we cover is engaging and relatable to everyone, even if you don't have a background in philosophy.

But in my experience, the Expos experience is invaluable to being prepared to write at a college level. This class was honestly one of my favorites this semester. I've never had the experience of taking a course centered around the topic queerness surrounded by other queer people–– though, of course, don't expect this to be a queer studies class. At the end of the day, it is a class that teaches you to write, and what you will end up writing about will be interpretations of different types of queer media. Dr. Pietras is very helpful during the revision process of your essays, but you need to make sure that you go to draft conferences with a draft that you have put some thought into. Even though the drafts aren't graded, it is difficult to get feedback that will help you turn in a polished final essay if the draft was just a few pages of writing without thought that you don't plan to influence the final essay. Don't be afraid to approach him with questions throughout your writing process, and when he has office hours, grab an appointment, even if you're not totally sure what you will talk about. Expos is one of the few writing–based classes where you have this level of involvement from your instructor throughout the writing process and ABOUT the writing process–– i.e. giving you strategies to improve your writing and streamline the way you write/edit. If you work hard in this course and show your instructor that you care, your writing, including structure, argumentation, and ability to persuade, will improve.

The course was an overall frustrating experience for several reasons.  First, class time was very boring, and about a half an hour of class each day was just devoted to the Preceptor reading slides off the board word–for–word.  Second, feedback was provided in a very slow manner.  We would often only receive the feedback from our papers one day before our next paper or draft was due.  This made any application of said feedback super challenging.  Third, the feedback that we received wasn't very helpful or direct.  I was frustrated by the feedback that I received as it was vague and sparse.  Fourth, the feedback was not very tailored to my actual needs.  One of my most frustrating experiences in this course was reading my feedback side by side with a peer in the course, only to notice that our feedback was nearly identical.  Fifth, the materials for the course were not all very interesting, especially given the theme.  Some of our materials didn't even mention queerness at all, and seemed to be reused from a past course on Nostalgia.  Finally, getting help in this course was very angering.  The preceptor was very reluctant to help students during or outside of class.  When approached during class with a question the Preceptor often refused to answer, or did so with hesitation.  We were allowed to send one email asking about one very specific aspect of our paper, and were occasionally allowed one 20 minute meeting to discuss our draft.  For a course designed to teach students a new skill the overall lack of help along the way seemed like a poorly guided decision.  I will say that I learned a lot about interpretive analysis in this class, but that is what I expected of this course.  The process of said learning, however, was far more challenging because of the and Preceptor than it was the content.",-0.39,,0.0,116353,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Expository Writing,Expository Writing,,None,,Seminar,Expository Writing 20

Professor Raymer is super nice, and the material is incredibly interesting. At the end of the day, try to pick an Expos section that sounds interesting to you. If you don't enjoy the material, expos won't be fun, but if you're engaged with it, it can be a very good class! With that said, the material in this course is very interesting and very engaging. We began by investigating the ethics of gene editing, looking at the issue from a wide variety of perspectives. There are some super interesting readings, for instance a couple that wanted their baby to be blind – there's just so much to unpack in this topic. We then moved into the topic of death, and how to approach the end of life. Did this get a little dark at times? Yes. But it really raised some incredible questions, and I'm glad we dove into this issue. For instance, I'm completely making up the numbers here, but let's say there's a treatment that gives you a 10% chance to survive beyond 5 years, but 90% of people on this treatment die within 6 months quite uncomfortably. Now, if you decide to stop fighting the disease, but instead focus on comfort in the end, you have a 70% chance of living to 1.5 years in hospice care. These aren't real numbers, but the idea behind this can often be quite true. So how should we approach the ends of our lives? Focus on extending them as much as possible, or living a fully as we can? And what is the responsibility of medical practitioners in cases like these? How do you balance giving hope versus being a realist? How should we think about our own deaths, and the dying of our family members. A lot of very interesting things. Finally, we moved on to our research projects. People studied a whole range of topics, from euthanasia to DIY biology to human–animal chimeras to healthcare, and it was a great chance to dive into a very interesting area.Professor Raymer would have our final papers due one week after we received our feedback from her, which was incredibly helpful – it gave a chance to really take advantage of her suggestions and work them into our papers well. She was very willing to help with questions, and her feedback itself was very useful.

I am honestly a little puzzled reading previous Q guide comments about this course. I found myself thinking about the concepts we discussed in class a lot, such as the nature of suffering, punishment and criminal justice, and the relation of contemporary political issues to hells and underworlds. I was actually randomly assigned this course after missing the expos sectioning preferences deadline, and at first was really worried about the course workload, grading etc. based on rumor and the syllabus. However, in hindsight, I'm very happy I took this course. Professor Scheffler is actually a very reasonable grader – my peers were averaging A– in their papers. He also gives INCREDIBLY detailed and useful feedback on response papers, such that there is absolutely adequate support to do well in your papers, despite the slight scarcity of office hours (sometimes his comments are longer than your entire response paper). He is also excellent in facilitating discussions in class. He has an amazing ability to sum up and evaluate people's contributions super clearly and offer counterarguments when appropriate, which I found helped my understanding of the texts a lot.  The workload is totally reasonable as long as you spread out your work throughout the weeks (and not do what I did and spend 30 hours straight in Cabot cramming in the final paper – that was one hell of a katabatic journey XD). I found the papers pretty enjoyable to write about (I wrote about Dante's Inferno, and the films Pan's Labyrinth and Parasite) and was happy we got to study some films, not just texts. Personally, I enjoyed the modern stuff about hell the most (at the beginning we cover some older/classical texts like Homer, Gilgamesh and Milton).",0.9855,,0.0,,0.0,116353,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Expository Writing,Expository Writing,,None,,Seminar,Expository Writing 20

In Kate's tremendous section, I grew to have a confidence not only with speaking but also with sharing my inner voice with other people. Through a poetry class at Harvard, I had already learned how to put my thoughts onto paper. Yet never had I felt comfortable saying them out loud to other people, let alone standing at the front of a big room with many people and commanding attention to tell a story or message. That was completely new!I leave the class confident in my voice, and I feel the effects every day, whether I'm talking with friends, at clubs, with family, or in professional settings at work. The confidence of a Harvard–educated public speaker, maybe?  Who knows. Yet somehow the class really did transform my attitude toward myself and what I can do, so long as I prepare adequately, through its experience–based four speeches over the course of the semester, combined with weekly student and instructor feedback. During class sessions, the class can feel like what I imagine a theater class can feel like: fun, varied warm ups,  a spirit of ""YES! And?."" It's no surprise, given that my preceptor, Katy, seems to have spent a lot of time with a Shakespeare company. But that type of class structure and thinking, so refreshing to someone with a more technical, stem/finance background, really opened me up to a new way of thinking. Our class got so close, over the course of the semester, that we all went thrifting with each other in our free time––twice! This class is definitely a no brainer.

In addition, while you don’t absolutely have to spend a lot of time on the class (it is pass fail), you have to commit time if you want something to be proud of. Most likely, you will want to show people your final project. If that is the case you probably will have to come in the studio for around 4–6 extra hours a week to work.

You will gain an appreciation for the complexity of environmental policy in today’s partisan system, an economic background on carbon emissions reduction policy strategies, and an understanding of various types of businesses working to help fight climate change. Readings are assigned weekly, and while some of them are a bit long and technical, most of them are interesting and useful for that week’s class.

The class is structured such that each week (sometimes every other week) students read a book discussing a different aspect of economics. Here is the list of books that we read this past semester:– The Worldly Philosophers (Robert Heilbroner)– Capitalism and Freedom (Milton Friedman)– Equality and Efficiency: The Big Tradeoff (Arthur Okun)– Leave Me Alone and I’ll Make You Rich (Dierdre McClosky and Art Carden)– A Brief History of Equality (Thomas Piketty)–  Open Borders: The Science and Ethics of Immigration (Bryan Kaplan)– Career and Family (Claudia Goldin)In addition, each week a different student writes a NYT–style op ed about an economic area of choice. These op eds are incredibly fun to write, read, and edit, and often produce very heated contestation from both sides of the aisle. Honestly, even if you don't like economics, Professor Mankiw makes this class lively and intellectually engaging. He does a great job moderating the discussion, and he is very fun to debate, especially if you do not agree with his political leanings. If you do take this course, you will get out of it whatever you choose to put in. It is very possible to do well in the class simply by reading the introductions and conclusions of each book and quickly typing up an op ed. If, on the other hand, you instead put in the work to read each book cover–to–cover, craft an excellent op ed, and participate fully in each discussion, I can guarantee that by the end of the course you will have a much more developed and articulate understanding of the many economic challenges that currently plague our society.

Professor Rudenstine knows an incredible amount about the poetry itself. It is so clear that he has lived with these lines—and his insights are precious. There were times in class when he explained a line or stanza so well that I could do nothing more than just smile.  The workload is quite manageable. Most weeks, the homework is just to read a set of poems. This usually took me a few hours. If you take this course, I encourage you to put in an honest effort toward the poems. It'll be difficult to meaningfully contribute in discussion if you don't really understand the poems.  There are a few essays, but those two are enjoyable. We wrote ours on ""Filling Station"" (Elizabeth Bishop) and ""Midterm Break"" (Seamus Heaney), and both were poems that I'll remember for a while. There were also a few dinners outside of class that we shared together, and those were thoroughly enjoyable. Aside from the clear benefit of being able to enjoy a meal outside of the dining halls, it was also fun to get to see everyone outside of a classroom setting. I think these dinners left me with the feeling that I knew the people in this seminar better.

Class discussions are interesting and you'll find yourself engaged, but they don't necessarily prepare you in a technical manner for the assignment, meaning you will have to self–learn a lot of Rhino. The in–class demonstrations are helpful with introducing the basics, but you basically have to choose between following along and committing to memory or taking notes, as lectures aren't usually recorded.  There aren't any written notes to refer back to, so it's very important to pay attention during class. Beyond the basics, it's up to you to learn the rest of Rhino. Rhino itself can definitely be finicky. If you don't have a Windows desktop, either find a computer on campus at a lab to use (they are free of charge) or get one for yourself. You will have many breakdowns trying to get Rhino to work if you aren't on a device with enough computing power and compatibility with Rhino. Finally, expect that you might take a lot of time working on some assignments or completing some readings, but they won't ever be reviewed or discussed.

Every week, we read a new text (mostly fiction, which includes films) and have a table–discussion about it for 2 hours, book club style; and while discussions are fun, the best part is always listening to Matt's own interpretations which range from thought–provoking to mind–blowing. That said, because of the emphasis on discussion, if you want to take this course, it'd be a benefit to everyone if you actually read the weekly readings and engage in thoughtful discussion. For that reason, I think there's some level of work expected to be put into the course – some of the novels can be pretty long (I learned to be a faster reader for this class alone)! But the readings are mostly pretty fun to read (and if they aren't just know that Matt's take on said reading will probably completely change your perspective on it).The content of the course tends to be rather heavy, but I think an existential crisis or two is worth the deep inspection of truths about humanity and society that is often so sobering and clarifying.

It is a difficult course to lottery into. Is the hype proportional to the actual learning and execution? It is a well–run course for sure, and the teaching team sincerely values the feedback, but I may be in the unpopular side of the opinion in saying that it isn't dramatically the far away best course I have taken. I'd encourage anyone to lottery to this course because of its unique concepts, but it won't shape you into a new person.One one hand, it teaches unique concepts on a topic that is not really talked about, conflict resolution. It really is eye–opening to a good extent. It is like putting words to ideas and behaviors in a manner similar to psychology in attempting to explain how negotiation and conflict resolution work. The professor, Dan, is extremely eloquent and a very effective communicator, but almost too effective so that we become used to it. The teaching team is extremely dedicated as well, taking the time to review every assignment and plan everything very intentionally. They also take feedback seriously but almost to the point where it is too much input, as entire lessons are tried new even though their effectiveness is not clear.On the other hand, the course sometimes feels dry in the lectures in that it is a 3 hour class and difficult to go on for a long time just seated. Activities sometimes help but even two hours is challenging at times, especially given the 3–5:45pm class time. Grading is also somewhat slow, taking a few weeks for each assignment, though immediate feedback is not always necessary. Additionally, many of the activities felt like there was not sufficient buy–in. The reason why conflict resolution is so difficult is because it is impossible to separate one's own perspective from the rational and emotional considerations. In any of these exercises, one could simply decide that the ""so what"" to losing or not doing anything is nothing, and so there is not sufficient effectiveness to some of them. It may be said that you get what you put in, but in these cases, maybe part of it is realizing not all conflicts are worth my time and assigning artificially inflated value to them is counterproductive. The course also suffers a bit from a self–aware sense of being one of the most desired and highly regarded courses, which makes it get an intangible vibe of being more important than it actually is and making sure every student treats it extremely seriously.",0.9929,"People spend ridiculous amounts of money in expensive courses to learn the Harvard method of negotiation, while for us, it is accesible (if you win the lottery) and will count towards your requirements. It is rare to find a course where you will feel you are becoming better as a person and improving you social skills like this one. Thus, there is little reason not to take it. However, if you need to get an A, carefully consider the tradeoffs. This course does not have a heavy workload (you don't really need all of the readings), but GRADING IS NOT LENIENT.  Almost all of it will be based on your ability to write essays, which is extremely annoying as the course is not about that and you don't really learn much from that. Be careful. It probably ruined my 4.0",-0.4261,"It’s a good class, as I’m sure you can tell from the consistent rave reviews.

In my 4 years here I've never interacted more with a class and have learned so much through the lectures, readings, and guest speakers. The class is definitely rough around some edges and lots of controversy surrounded different topics, but I think Merseth handled everything gracefully and acknowledged her mistakes and listened to the students. I admire her for leading a course like this that covers so many touchy topics, especially around identity. You might not agree some things she says or some of the readings, but the goal is to ultimately get students to think about these issues proactively, and have a discussion around them. It has been an incredibly valuable experience and definitely has me thinking about what type of impact and change I want to enact after college, even as a senior. The guest speakers are incredibly inspiring, and the community of the class is so amazing. I have nothing but good things to say about this class. I hope some version of it is brought back in the future, though I'm sure it won't be quite as chill as this year (all you had to do was like an hour of readings for each class and 3 really easy essay assignments, one of which was pass/fail).

This class can be a great introduction to the complexities and details of the healthcare system and the economics behind it (you will learn about epidemiology, pharmaceuticals, health insurance, and some basic statistics).

I was constantly reflecting on the lectures and trying to put into practice the concepts we were learning about in order to make myself a more thoughtful and grounded person in my personal and academic life. I feel genuinely more alive and more human after taking this course. I take deeper breaths, I stop to recognize that someone near me is having an 'off' day, I am more forgiving of myself. I could go on and on. It also feels like an accomplishment to have read some of the most foundational texts of the classical chinese tradition. TAKE THIS COURSE. Unless you NEED visuals during a lecture, please please do yourself a favor and take this course. It's not a ton of weekly work, but yet you still demonstrate your understanding in a variety of ways. Without too much work, the course does exactly what a good education should do –– makes you a better person in the world without demanding busy work to reach that aim.Michael Puett is gold on Harvard's campus. Everyone should take a course with him during their Harvard career. He is brilliant, joyful, and energetic. His lecturing style worked very well for me personally as an auditory learner.

This course is highly dependent on the section's leader; Hence, if you get a bad section leader that will only give 2A– in the class and all others a B/C, YOU'RE SCREWED. It also have a tremendous amount of essay to write compared to other GENED I have ever taken in my life, and those essay are closed–book, so if you are a STEM student with limited background in writing, YOU'RE SCREWED. Furthermore, the grade curve here is harsh.

Then, you learn about what the solutions will be and what policies are needed (final 3rd of the class). The class is really low in workload (and stress) but gives you so much information about climate change. Prof. Schrag is extremely dedicated (and a great lecturer) and very nice (ex. offers a huge extra credit opportunity!). If you already know a lot about climate change, this may be basic.

However, know that the professor is sometimes unbearable in that he is very knowledgeable about the subject (climate change) but extremely arrogant. It's his way or the highway. He is soft spoken, but can be condescending. This class has a lot of graduate students, and a lot of times, they would try to test or propose a different argument or perspective. Granted, some of the graduate students are also super arrogant, but the professor frequently interrupts the speaker without them comprehensively express their thoughts and try to make everyone in the class think the speaker is wrong and the professor is right. Sorry, but a lot of these topics do not have a right or wrong. It's all blurred and grey, so if you want to hear this guy trying to boost his ego for 75 minutes 2 times a week, go ahead. The grading rubric is completely arbitrary. Your midterms are out of 10 points, and sometimes you get one point taken off because you didn't say a specific word. So, imagine losing 3 points, which for any other midterm wouldn't be too bad, but for these midterms, that means you get a 70 already.",-0.9174,TAKE IT!!!

Lectures were fairly interesting, and it was cool how Profs Flad and Ur (who are clearly both experts in the field) used examples from their own research. Section was by far the highlight –– you get to do fun experiments (making pottery, making stone tools, etc.) to get some hands–on experience with the archaeological ideas that were discussed in lecture. The TFs were also great. The workload wasn't too bad; reading quizzes make sure you actually do the reading, but it was rarely more than ~30–45 minutes worth per lecture. The weekly assignments (a 500–1000 word reflection on section) were a bit hit–or–miss in terms of topic but not the end of the world in the grand scheme of things. Overall, I'm quite glad that I took this course, and would recommend it strongly to anyone who is interested in learning more about archaeology and/or needs another gened. I think that this class does a great job achieving the goals of the gened system, as it caused me to engage with an interesting subject that I had no prior exposure to and that has important ramifications for society. A few caveats: • The course does not communicate expectations very well. The syllabus refers to nebulous ""section assignments,"" without really specifying that this includes a not–insignificant writing assignment every week. If you're going to assign weekly work, make it clear in the syllabus so that people know what sort of workload to expect. Additionally, the expectations for the final project were extremely unclear. The assignment page was multiple pages long, with a very complicated rubric. It shouldn't require that much effort just to decipher what we're being asked to write. A clearer assignment (along with examples of what a successful project looks like) would go a long way.  • There is an extremely strong ideological bent, particularly in Prof. Ur's lectures. While I'm not going to pretend to be surprised that a professor at Harvard is liberal, at times the evangelism was so strong that the class could have been a skit made by Tucker Carlson making fun of what he thinks Harvard is like. During many of the ""debates"" it was clear that there was one right side and one wrong side, and that any perspectives other than the party line would not have been tolerated. I imagine that this doesn't bother most people, but if you're someone who gets bothered by one–sided preaching you might not like that aspect of the class.   • The professors did these annoying ""breakouts"" during lecture, where a question would be asked and people would have to discuss with their neighbors. After the 2020–21 year, I didn't think anything could be more annoying and awkward than zoom breakout rooms, but the in–person analogue was even worse. I would strongly encourage the professors to change this for next year.",0.9975,"Section assignments feel like busywork and often require prior preparation.

Overall, I'm quite glad that I took this course, and would recommend it strongly to anyone who is interested in learning more about archaeology and/or needs another gened. I think that this class does a great job achieving the goals of the gened system, as it caused me to engage with an interesting subject that I had no prior exposure to and that has important ramifications for society. A few caveats: • The course does not communicate expectations very well. The syllabus refers to nebulous ""section assignments,"" without really specifying that this includes a not–insignificant writing assignment every week. If you're going to assign weekly work, make it clear in the syllabus so that people know what sort of workload to expect. Additionally, the expectations for the final project were extremely unclear. The assignment page was multiple pages long, with a very complicated rubric. It shouldn't require that much effort just to decipher what we're being asked to write. A clearer assignment (along with examples of what a successful project looks like) would go a long way.  • There is an extremely strong ideological bent, particularly in Prof. Ur's lectures. While I'm not going to pretend to be surprised that a professor at Harvard is liberal, at times the evangelism was so strong that the class could have been a skit made by Tucker Carlson making fun of what he thinks Harvard is like. During many of the ""debates"" it was clear that there was one right side and one wrong side, and that any perspectives other than the party line would not have been tolerated. I imagine that this doesn't bother most people, but if you're someone who gets bothered by one–sided preaching you might not like that aspect of the class.   • The professors did these annoying ""breakouts"" during lecture, where a question would be asked and people would have to discuss with their neighbors. After the 2020–21 year, I didn't think anything could be more annoying and awkward than zoom breakout rooms, but the in–person analogue was even worse. I would strongly encourage the professors to change this for next year.",0.9975,"Section assignments feel like busywork and often require prior preparation.

If you are lucky enough to get her as a TF you are set. I would encourage you to take this class but just know that it still requires a decent amount of effort, but you can get away with not doing all the readings.",0.9908,"This course was a pedagogical catastrophe. I write this not out of spite but out of sadness and concern, disappointment at the gap between what this course promised to be and what it was. And I write this as someone who cares deeply about education, immigration, and history: If this course is not changed dramatically, it will produce poor historians, writers, and activists.A list of major problems with this course:1)	Ethics: Although this is supposed to be an ethics and civics gened, there were no ethical frameworks used or any meaningful ethics teaching. Every unit would go a little something like this: We would read about a border that contributed to some violence, the professor would imply heavily that borders = violence = bad, this would be reiterated in section discussion, and then we’d move on. This used truisms – borders exclude people! – to avoid meaningful ethical discussions: Is exclusion inherently violent or immoral? What are the relationships between violence and immorality? Can we generate axioms or a standardized set of ethical considerations when evaluating a particular border? I came into this course with experience in immigration protest and a strong belief in the need to abolish or at least heavily curtail borders. I thought I’d be asked to engage with other beliefs in order to test, bolster, and better communicate my own. In fact, the opposite happened. The course’s very obvious but tacit anti–borders orientation leaves its students utterly unprepared to have substantive, difficult conversations with people who believe in borders because the class never in good faith entertained those beliefs, and the ethical reasoning behind them. 2)	History: This course jumped around in both space and time in a way that was disorienting and created shallow coverage.  We spent much of the time on Europe – World War I and the Cold War – and yet had almost zero historical context for those units. (This was related to siloed, out of context assignments, explained further below.) Without an ethical framework affording cohesion, the course needed historical momentum and narrative. Instead, it felt like we were randomly picking borders with next to no historical awareness – the plebiscites, for example – and the only unifying thread was Eurocentrism. I understand the impulse to start and end in the United States, but if this course wants to be global, it should be willing to spend more time afield – the Koreas, Africa post–colonization, etc.!3)	Assignments: The assignments were poorly constructed. The midterm in particular asked students to make an argument from six lines in an excel column. It was framed as a map exercise, but the map was essentially irrelevant; all the data came from those six lines. I got a near perfect score simply by reiterating the lecture on plebiscites, because there was zero other historical material from the class, and we weren’t allowed to even try to understand the historical context using outside material. The assignment implied the way to succeed was 1) restate exactly what the professor says; and 2) imply causation from correlation in the numbers. These are the opposite of the lessons students – especially young historians – should be learning. Similarly, with the final project: This isn’t 2015 anymore; podcasts are no longer new and creative. The course needs to either commit to having a creative final project that lets people draw on their creative skillsets, or have a final paper/exam. This in–between is frustrating – it’s as much or more work than a paper, but not truly creative enough to let students think outside the box. 4)	Technology: Almost half of the lectures were waylaid by technological failures that sucked up class time and impeded learning. Things like setting up subtitles on a video, using Google Earth, etc. would neutralize entire class activities and knock out 10–15 minutes of class time. Yes, technology can be finnicky, but not a single other professor I’ve had at Harvard has struggled to this extent, especially after the Zoom year, which afforded most teachers a basic level of technological competence. There are basic technological skills all instructors should have mastered by now.5)	Fraught lectures: Sensitive, politically complex discussions should be led by experts: We should not be learning about issues as fraught as Israel–Palestine from someone unequipped to facilitate deep conversations. This unit alone was shockingly mishandled. First, we spent an entire class watching a documentary with no context – a documentary that was flagrantly propagandistic, playing machine gun and bomb noises whenever Jewish sources spoke. After the documentary, we had time for exactly two questions: One student in the class asked “how the Jews got their weapons,” to which the professor responded “I don’t know.” !!! Another student asked who made the movie, to which the professor also responded that she wasn’t sure. Beyond the obvious pedagogical neglect inherent in showing a movie without knowing its sourcing, it was devastating to hear absolutely zero response to a basic question about the conflict (phrased in a way that definitely demanded unpacking!) The next lecture featured some ex post facto attempts to clean up the mess, which seemed shoehorned in, given how much the class ran over. Anyways, the damage was done. I think the unit was indicative of a bigger flaw in the current gened system, which allows professors who are experts in other fields to each tenuously related subjects as pet projects. The professor told us she taught this class because she felt she had to after Trump era border separation. I’m sympathetic to this political starting point, but not the fact that it emboldened her to claim expertise she doesn’t have on regions and issues that matter a great deal to a lot of people. Perhaps a co–professor would go a long way. 6)	Resistance to feedback: Earlier in the course, I submitted versions of these complaints via the anonymous feedback form. At the start of the next class, the professor summarily entertained them and dismissed them, in a way that made clear the point of the form was not to modify the course at all, but to reactionarily defend its decisions. Similarly, in the last lecture, we were told to be nice in our Q guide reviews, lest we hinder the teaching careers of our TFs. Do you all not understand that this defeats the purpose of the Q guide? Not to mention how condescending and educationally bankrupt it is. Both the mid–semester feedback form and the Q–Guide recognize that students may have legitimate issues with the way a course is being taught. The correct response to this is not to either ignore that feedback or preemptively shape it. The correct response is to LISTEN to the students. 7)	Attention: Many lectures started with or included a plea for students to not be distracted. Yes, technology and the pandemic have had a deleterious effect on attention spans and attitudes toward learning. But there’s a reason why we were bored! The lectures lacked cohesion or a driving principle; they felt like a random dissemination of information with weak gestures towards analysis (see the ethics point.) Attention is earned. If more than half your class is either not showing up or doing other work during class, that should be some indication that the class needs to be doing more. In sum, please do not take this course – especially if you are a freshman. It will prepare you poorly for later history courses, ethics courses, and courses that require writing. Upperclassmen – take this course only if you need a gem.",-0.9712,"Readings are fair, and topic is super interesting. The lectures are very hard to keep up with (not because of content, but the way they're structured/taught). Assignments are fair and fun.

Beyond that, the course was just a regurgitation of ""those who are mentally ill struggle"" and ""mental health stigma is bad"" every week. Professor is receptive to feedback; we expressed that the readings were too much and she trimmed it down. However, when we said the course was not engaging, she decided to throw more busy work at us with polls and random useless response questions on Canvas. This was a drag and did not add anything special to the class. By not engaging, we meant that the course material she discussed at length was boring. Once again, just repetition. No unique focus on art styles or psychology or social constructions of stigma/bias. Just surface level engagement discussing the very nuanced topic of mental health/illness. The grading breakdown is generous and you can definitely pass but it will feel like a drag sometimes due to the busy work. Harsh or lenient grading depends on your TF.

It is NOT a gem and it is NOT easy. You have to put in a lot (a LOT) of work to get in the A range, and even then, putting in a lot of work will only take you so far. Kertzer is an amazing lecturer and is extremely knowledgeable. The teaching staff is great. Section was also great (for me). The exams and paper were somewhat painful, but not horrible. This class covers a LOT of content, and you sometimes have to take strides on your own time to connect the dots from one topic to the next. This course is very pro–America (obviously), but it might be something you want to keep in mind.The exams in this course are entirely writing–based. Anything Kertzer says and anything in the readings is fair game – and I mean it! Lots of definition–style questions (fill in the blanks), short–answer questions (paragraphs), and essays. The short–answer questions are graded very harshly (from my experience). You have to write in the way they want! If you're a mind–reader, this shouldn't be too difficult for you. For us lowly folk, it can be hard to know what to say. Giving the correct answer isn't enough. That will only get you ~1/2 the points. The essay questions are usually pretty broad and not too hard to do well on. With that said, it can be really hard to score in the top range (say 16–18/18 possible points). The readings for class are LONG and PLENTIFUL. I spent hours and hours trying to understand the readings. If you get behind, it can be very difficult to catch up. You have to put in a lot of effort to memorize the readings. It was sometimes annoying that the reading I spent a lot of time studying wouldn't even show up on the exam. But you can't leave one out – if you do, you know that will be the one that shows up. The reading responses due each week on slack were horribly annoying, I won't lie.The guest speakers for this class were amazing. Kertzer is also amazing. Attending lecture is usually a positive experience, although attendance isn't always required as far as an attendance grade. With that said, there is a LOT of government vocabulary you have to learn and be able to use. For that reason, I only recommend this course for people who are serious about pursuing a gov concentration. I thought that was me at the beginning of the year, but I've now settled into the English path. I put my entire heart and soul into my policy paper to get an A. Although it wasn't perfect, I probably spent around 50 hours on the paper over the course of a month (more like 2.5 weeks because I slacked off at first). I recommend writing about something you are truly interested in. If this means you propose a new prompt, then so be it. You will be spending a LOT of time with this paper – make sure you care about it. When all was said and done, I was very proud of my paper and was able to display it to my friends and family; however, this was not without strenuous effort and grief. I didn't see the sun for 3 days leading up to the paper submission deadline.Above all, try to make friends – with the teaching staff and with other classmates. It made the work much more bearable. I really enjoyed working with my friends leading up to exams and will miss it next semester. Good luck with Gov 1790!",0.9981,"Neoliberal as hell but not that hard, and you can challenge that in ur paper",-0.2278,"TAKE THIS CLASS. It will teach you how to think critically about foreign policy issues happening now and in history. This class will help you develop informed opinions about major American foreign policy topics like counterterrorism, nuclear weapons, emerging technology, the rise of China, the role of international institutions, the role of the media and public opinion, but even more importantly, it will show you that foreign policy is so much more complex and nuanced than the oversimplifications that we see in the media. Take this class to be a more informed person, a more critical thinker, and to simply learn so much about the international system. It changed my life!!!! Made me sure that I wanted to be a GOV concentrator. Kertzer is an absolute GEM of a professor, and he is so effective, empathetic, and engaging in his lectures. He makes every lecture extremely relevant and even makes efforts to have lunch with all of us.

If you have already taken AP US History or have a general understanding of US History, then this really will not further your knowledge more than a few Wikipedia articles. Professor Bekemeyer is undoubtedly an excellent lecturer––he almost reminds me of John Green when he's speaking, and definitely highlighted key laws and case studies in class. However, the readings, while very interesting (most were from books published for a general audience), felt disconnected and had too many pages assigned, so many people in section didn't do them, and honestly they did not really contribute much for the exams or writing assignments. Additionally, the grading is rougher than you'd expect for this class––each essay and exam is weighted heavily, and there are no small assignments to get feedback on or try to improve your grade, which makes these assignments incredibly important. On top of this, no rubrics were provided, and the only grading guideline was ""it will be graded holistically."" While the class did lack in actual substance (unless maybe you knew very little about modern US history), it could have made up for in primary source analysis or historical reasoning, but it really didn't, especially because there were two essays. Besides the lack of clarity for grading, there was no *major* issue with this class; I think it lacked in overall substance and meaning, and is neither a chill history gem or an engaging, fascinating course.",0.9809,218586,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,History,History,,Social Sciences,,Lecture,The American Century?: A History of the United States since World War II

The material itself covered in the course is fantastic and homework readings may not even feel like work because they're so interesting. There's also a great balance of films covered in the syllabus too which is a nice way to enjoy something different after reading a book. We didn't have weekly responses in this class even though they were listed on the syllabus, which was helpful in taking away some stress and focus more on discussion. Don't be scared off by the essays, which really aren't bad, especially if you pick a topic that interests you, and they build up gradually to the culminating essay so you can focus on specific skills in each one.  As a first–year, I was worried that the essays would be difficult since I haven't taken Expos yet, but they were the ideal amount of challenge for me to grow as a writer, and I feel MUCH more confident in tackling essays after this class. Professor White is so helpful and supportive and provides really encouraging, detailed constructive feedback that gives you specific things to work on, which makes it less overwhelming. He is also available for office hours even outside the scheduled office hours times, and I'd recommend attending them because they're really beneficial for figuring out how to get on the right track for a paper. This class was definitely my favorite of the semester and has me considering a Hist and Lit concentration, so I can't rave about it enough.

But I will say that this course made me reconsider being a HistSci concentrator; if it weren't required, I would not recommend it to any student. Not because it is hard (it wasn't, especially if you start brainstorming topics and working on your paper early), but because there are so many better structured and organized courses that would teach you the same skills (and more) in writing an extensive paper. There is value in putting together your final 25–page research project, especially if you take the time to create something you are proud of. I think I'll look back on my paper fondly for a long time! That being said, there is so little concrete support from the class itself to put together this paper; the only thing I felt like this class gave me was the actual reason to write the paper.Plenary is not beneficial. It is unclear what the attendance policy is, but if it is/was optional, I would say you could never attend plenary and still produce the exact same finished product! The utility of section is highly HIGHLY dependent on your TF, and I would recommend that you switch TF's/sections at the beginning of the semester if you get the sense that your TF is not going to give you useful feedback on your intermediate assignment if that is what you want.Like I said, this is a required course, so nothing I say will change your mind on whether to take this course. But I hope a History of Science faculty or staff member reads this and realizes that some aspects of this course's structure and contents need to change. I have spoken with several concentrators who have said that this course actively made them decide not to write a senior thesis, which is a loss for the department.

There are a few things that played into this being such a great course.  First off, Andrew Bottoms is a fantastic teacher.  He is kind, funny, informative, and never makes you feel bad for making mistakes.  With ASL being new to most students in the class,  Andrew fostered a positive culture around taking risks and having fun.  This course is not a major time suck at all.  Homework never took more than 3 hours in a week other than preparing our final presentation.  Tests are all reasonable, and if you pay attention in class and review a bit you'll find success.  I never found myself stressed  over this class.  I will say that Andrew can be slow to give feedback on videos or emails, so just know that going into the course.  In person, however, Andrew loves getting to know students and helping them dive deeper into ASL.",0.9846,I think everyone should take ASL! Many assume that the language is similar to ASL when it's very different.

The two–hour–long lectures, very difficult assignments, and 3,000–word final paper will be a delight if you really do love phonetics and phonology. If it turns out phonetics and phonology aren’t for you,  you’ll think, “I’m so glad I took this class, but I’ve had my fill now.” I fall into the latter category and can say that either way, you’ll win. So grateful I got to take this class and to learn from Professor Franich and can say it was definitely worth taking.With that, under Professor Franich (a phonetician), the course is pretty phonetics heavy. We had two clear–cut phonetics assignments, one articulatory phonology assignment (which really just felt like a phonetics assignment), two Optimality Theory assignments, one rules–based phonology assignment, and one perceptual phonology assignment. You’ll use fairly specialized software for the entirety of the last two assignments (which you should DEFINITELY start early so that you can debug, find participants, etc. as needed). TaDa is very cool, and it’s always great to pick up some new technical skills. I didn’t realize just how rich of a discipline phonetics was, and I’m glad Professor Franich opened my eyes to that.I liked the format of the homework. It’s usually two or three really hard questions that require substantial amounts of time and thought to answer. It was great to think through problems on such a deep level! I had a lot of fun working through them. And yes, they can be a lot to tackle, but Professor Franich is VERY helpful and patient over email and in office hours. So really, you’ll get to spend your semester tackling conceptually rich problems that required thorough, flexible, creative, and critical thinking. This class will make you a much stronger problem solver and thinker. Also, Professor Franich knows a TON about experimental design, laboratory work, field work, etc. and can discuss them with you in very accessible terms. And she has so much wisdom and experience to share re: the design of constraints, conventions around writing in linguistics, etc. (She’s also a phonologist!) Definitely go to her office hours, talk with her after class, etc. The final squib was the hardest paper I’ve written since the spring of ‘21. But that made finishing it that much more empowering and encouraging.Professor Franich would have us get up at the board and draw tableau, write rules, etc., which I loved. In summary, LING 115 is the hardest linguistics class I’ve taken, and I’m glad I took it because it’s fun and interactive and made me a better problem solver!Fellow undergraduates: DO NOT take graduate–level classes lightly. Only take one at a time. The final squibs are a beast — and one alone will be doable but a lot to manage when you have other finals to worry about.

If you don't know the concept period, you're stuck unless another member of the group has taken calc before. You can ask questions, but in my section the teacher usually just told students to think about it more (???). There's no note taking in a formal math notebook unless you want to make more work for yourself; you just jot down whatever you need in the margins of the worksheet usually. Honestly, you might be at a disadvantage if you have zero calc background since they don't really teach, just give you worksheet problems to do. I also had to switch out of a different teacher's class (same math class just different time slot and teacher) because his voice was hard to understand and he just didn't clarify students' questions.

Additionally, many of the PSets I was unable to complete by myself: I will never get back the hours I spent from 7:30pm–10:00pm in the MQC for so many nights this semester, feeling miserable. Some of the CA's are great, others are really moody, not super helpful and talk to like you are sort of dumb. 2. The projects are not that related to course material at all. I wish they were: it would make the class better, however, they are not. No one in any of my groups did any work and I ended up doing a lot of it. 3. The way the sections are structured can be pretty bad. The first half of the semester, there was no demonstration or lecture at the beginning of class to show you how to do what you were supposed to be doing. You were expected to stumble through a worksheet with a group of fellow students (many of which had completely different learning styles than I did) and ""figure it out."" This was miserable.

I personally really loved the class. Material: A large emphasis is on ecological modeling,  but if you're into medicine or biochemistry, the topics will also flow throughout the course. There are also concepts that come from human anatomy (either in papers like epidermal wounds, leukemia modeling, cardiac electrophysiology) that are introduced through a mathematical lens and changed my way of viewing processes like heartbeats, healing, and medication.Lecture: Honestly it is so useful when it comes to reviewing the steps you need to approach in solving a problem set question. Go to every class and write down everything Wes puts on the board, even if it takes a minute to understand. It might click as you work through problems.Problem sets: They're only once a week, which is so much better than Math 21a and 21b. If you're between this class and Math 22a or 22b, I'd select 19a if you don't have experience with proofs. Also office hours were helpful because the TFs are patient and will guide you as you approach questions. Show up even if you barely started.Exams: It's nice that there are only two. It's scary that they cover so much content. One thing that caught me off guard is that your understanding of the readings is also asked. It's nothing tricky or too specific. If you take notes while Todd presents the key points in the article and later review his lecture slides (which contain more notes on Canvas) then you'll be ready. As for the math portion, make sure you know the rationale behind what certain topics are and not just the steps, because some questions will not be so simple as to just memorize the steps and write them down.Final Project: Start early!! Your proposal is due sometime in mid–October. If you're learning about a certain concept in LS1a, LPS A, or another life sciences adjacent class, pick your favorite and find some math behind it. This way, it feels more interesting as you learn more and study for your other class. As long as you begin graphing models (at least one graph) before Thanksgiving break and continue before/throughout reading period, you'll be fine.Always reach out to Wes! He's a great person to talk to and genuinely is rooting for everyone's success. If his office hours don't work for you, reach out for an appointment!

This class is indeed intense; conceptually, as the topics are abstract and the math is nothing like calculus, and time–wise, as the three–pset–per–week grind is constant, unending, and will require care and dedication. This class was like learning a language, or cultivating a plant requiring lots of daily attention. It's your child for the semester. Good time management skills are crucial to prevent late nights, but you will probably still have some late nights, and it does take a village––GO TO MQC!! Discussing questions with the CAs is extremely helpful because it helps iron out nuances, and that's very important.The class takes a nice practical focus and is both computationally and conceptually oriented, so if you come into it mentally prepared for the grind and prepared to give it love, you will certainly do well. It **is definitely doable if you just give it the time it requires**, it's not the type of class that leaves you still lost if you're starting the psets the day they're released, and blocking out time to really digest the material and review and study in addition to doing the psets. I can imagine that if a person did this, they'd be just fine. Especially with how there are in fact a lot of supports for your grade, it's actually very flexible and supportive. If you bomb your first midterm because you thought doing the psets was enough to understand the concepts and didn't study much, (AKA you need to study outside of class), there is a grade–weighting option. Don't get to a pset until very late at night because of life happenings and/or other work, after MQC has closed? You can drop it, six of them in fact. But a word of caution: DON'T fall behind early. DON'T use these pset drops early. Don't lean heavily on these supports, otherwise you will pay for it later and throughout the course because the material builds on itself!!!! This is NOT a class you can cram for, it's about building skills and knowledgeable intuition and *thoughtful* muscle memory.  And did I mention the material builds on itself? It's like a nesting doll with three or four layers and you need each, in the right order! The first portion of the course will feel pretty doable––there are some nuances, and it's not bad. But if I can provide any one piece of advice from my experience, it's that you really, really need to have a strong understanding of the concepts that comprise all the material leading up to the first midterm (and doing well on the first midterm will save you a lot of anxiety). This will make the rest of the course go infinitely smoother, and not leave you with a sense that you're on a ship and there are a million holes leaking water everywhere that you have to keep patching up (speaking from experience here). Build the hull the right way the first time.If you do these things, you will do well! Yes, it's fast–paced. Yes, the course really can't come second to others and be left behind or you will be left behind. But if you do this, you'll learn about an absolutely amazing realm of math that has just AWESOME implications for the world. It's genuinely incredibly powerful, with fascinating nuances and fascinating applications, including to differential equations (which was really cool to see through an explicit lens).

This class by far was my favorite class this semester. I am a freshman most likely concentrating in applied math cs and I felt like going into this year I got very little guidance on what to take. There are so many options! I took this class somewhat on a whim and I think it was the best choice by far. Here are my thoughts:18/19 seem like a lot of fun but they are very specific to their subject areas. In addition, not that many people are in them. Take it you are very passionate about those areas but not otherwise. 21 seems fun and a lot of people do it. That said, it’s a lot of computation and busy work since there are no proofs and 3 psets a week. They have to work on a pset pretty much every night (so it’s the same if not more of a time commitment than 22) but it’s a lot less rewarding (more plug and chug). You will also end up having to take an additional class (120 i think) to learn proofs anyway. I literally don’t know a single person who did applied math 22 it doesn’t seem to be very popular. 25 seems incredible but it’s A LOT of work. There is a reason there are 200 people who take 22 but only 40 who take 25. Most of my friends who tried out both classes in the beginning of the year dropped down to 22. It seems like the teacher is amazing and you get an incredible grasp of math on both a granular and broad level but it is going to be very hard and very time consuming. Only do it if you are really serious about pursuing math. In that case it will be very rewarding. Now for the reasons 22 is amazing!! First off, based on the comments on this page you have probably already heard that Dusty is amazing. He makes an effort to know everyone’s name. He is a very passionate lecturer. And he seems to overall really care for his student’s individually (which is really hard to find in other intro lecture classes). For example, he encourages you to email him or meet with him with any questions. If people do badly on an exam he offers corrections. There were even times during really stressful weeks where he offered pset extensions to the whole class. In addition, the community is great. Because it’s a pset class you will have to find people to work with which encourages you to make friends (and with 200 people there are a lot of opportunities to do so!). Somehow, when people discuss the class they assume that you know everyone in it (and that is pretty much true). GO TO OFFICE HOURS! Psets take a while by yourself but are easier and more fun with friends. In addition it’s a great way to meet people and find people to sit with. I would sometimes go to office hours by myself and just ask if anyone was working on a specific problem and join them. This is actually how I have found some of my best friends (even out of the class). Finally, the material is really fun. Proofs allow you to be creative and you walk away with a final project that you can be really proud of. The class overall is obviously challenging but as someone who hasn’t done linear or multi before I felt that it was doable!",0.9992,"take this class!!!!! i came in with no linear algebra or proof–based experience and the beginning is definitely tough, but dusty makes everything worth it. i sent the most mentally unhealthy stress email to him in the beginning of the term freaking out over our first midterm and he emailed back immediately and set up a meeting for the next day. we talked through studying strategies, he put my in contact with one of the course assistants who gave me one–on–one help (going over material again, answering my endless questions about stuff i didn't understand, helping me start pset problems, helping with exam corrections, etc. [THANK YOU CATHERINE YOU ARE A LIFESAVER]) and dusty also always chatted with me before class when i was just hanging out in the building. he is absolutely incredible. btw, if u don't learn well with textbooks, there are other ways to supplement lectures! i felt kinda guilty when i stopped reading the textbook but it genuinely wasn't working for me (and that is okay!!!). i liked three blue one brown videos (great visuals) and professor dave explains videos (he goes through topics quite slowly and does computational examples), and i'm fairly certain both youtubers are quite accurate. in conclusion, if u take this class – you got this!!! have fun! <3",-0.8435,,0.0,207485,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Mathematics,Mathematics,Yes,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Vector Calculus and Linear Algebra I

You are left with very important and fundamental proofs done in class or in problem sets or reviewed in the textbook. It is also strongly recommended to LaTeX your psets, which is very helpful when reviewing the psets for the midterms or the final exam, but also takes a lot of time (in my experience, about 5–6 per week). The class is VERY well put together and structured. All the problems have a meaning behind and will probably be useful at some later time in the course (go to Wes's office hours to learn the ""meaning"" of each problem).  The reading, unlike other classes, are straightforward and helpful. The lecture notes are too! I strongly recommend not skipping lecture, even though it's a 3 times per week 9am class, since not all lecture videos are uploaded, and by actively participating you learn a lot easier. Also, it is pretty easy to get left behind if you don't attend lectures. One thing that I did not like were the solutions to the psets, which were not quite useful, because they were skipping a lot of steps, and not giving proper explanations. Another thing I really liked was Wes's openness. He was very supportive after the first midterm, and did not release the mean of the exam, which was emotionally helpful for the students's sake. He really emphasized self growth, which I have rarely seen in teachers. I strongly recommend going to his office hours if possible. They are not that useful for solving the pset problems, but for understanding class material, and its usefulness in other areas (Wes is an applied mathematician and gives many examples for applicability of linear algebra).  Also, you get to build a connection with a wonderful faculty member. After the final exam, he said that whether we choose to take 25b or not (which is also his class), he is our supporter, and our adviser throughout our undergraduate experience. He said to reach out whenever we need anything math related. So, to sum up, Math 25a is a hard class, very thoroughly done linear algebra, but which proves to be helpful a lot of areas such as physics, and it is very well structured so that you get through the difficult material easier.",0.9984,"Take this class if you are fed up with rote calculations in math.

I believe most of the people in the class would tell you this is by far their favorite class (naturally) as a consequence of us spend the most time on this course and with other students solving the problems. I made an absolutely amazing group of friends through this class, who are not only passionate about math but also very study–focused, kind, collaborative, and hard working. If you want to get your college experience started off on the right foot by making a group of supportive, hard–working, and curious friends, this is THE way to go. Moreover, if you could handle it, finishing this course gives you the unshakable confidence you can handle whatever challenge and class that comes in the future at Harvard as this is probably the most intensive math experience you could get here. That is not to say one would necessarily become cocky; my classmates constantly dazzle me with their brilliance and curiosity and I also needed to seek out computational problems to fill in the holes in the applied side of things. We had an exposure of a wide range of higher level mathematics, and I felt my brain constantly expanding and challenged during this course as if I caught a glimpse of something sublime, an experience that is hard to replicate in the other freshman math courses. However, we barely did any computational problems or applications, and Math 25a taught more applications of linear algebra than Math 55a (though it is relatively easy to self study these applications, one could just ask 25a friends for their notes). If you are deciding between Math 25a and Math 55a like I was in the beginning of the year, I highly recommend sitting into both classes in the first week of class, and by the end of the second week you most definitely would know which class fits you better. Ideally, I recommend students who have taken/self studied a course on abstract algebra and a course on linear algebra to take this course. Personally I did not have any abstract algebra background coming in and I felt very behind than some other students in the first few weeks of class. However, I also have a few friends who came in with only calculus and linear algebra knowledge. Competition math experience might be slightly helpful but definitely not necessary, I personally was not a USAMO qualifier (though many classmates are) and I was able to handle the class just fine; I think the psets mostly test the understanding of complex material, perhaps 2 or 3 questions out of 10 questions require extensive problem solving. By virtue of putting some of the brightest kids into one classroom there were some getting used to in the beginning of the year. I remember the first two weeks or so the class was not necessarily the most welcoming as classmates wanted to prove themselves, but very quickly the classroom environment became mature and welcoming, very much a big family. So don't be intimidated by other students in the beginning, breathe.I wish someone told me what to do in the summer before freshman year to prepare for Math 55a, so here: there are roughly four 'units' – introduction to abstract algebra, linear algebra, harder group theory stuff, then ending with representation theory that ties linear algebra and group theory together. The first and third unit heavily relied on Artin's Algebra, the second unit basically covered the entire Linear Algebra Done Right book by Axler, and the last unit was based on the first 40 pages of Representation Theory written by Professor Harris himself. We ran through Artin chapter 2 in the beginning of the year then we just speed ran Axler, if possible I recommend reading through the first 5 chapters of Axler and Artin chapter 2.Coming in I was also curious what other Math 55a students took alongside this course in the fall. From my experience it seems that many students took Stat 110, a decent amount took CS 50 (a handful took CS 121 or CS 61), and many chose to have at least one Gen Ed or freshman seminar.On the question of balance: Taking Math 55a  does in many ways throw one into a grind culture. I did cut down my involvement in clubs and sometimes I could not check out opportunities I would liked to see if I did not have a pset due in two days. Looking back, I think one needs to constantly remind oneself to put quality social interactions above the problem sets. We were told there were only 5 late days for the semester but in reality the CAs are very lenient and you pretty much can take as many late days as you wish. I wish I learnt about this earlier so I could be less stressed and focused on always turning in the psets on time every Wednesday and be more present around my friends and intentionally spend more time socializing early on in the semester. The midterm was relatively easy and mostly meant as a check on if you know what is going on. The final was very difficult and I recommend starting it as early as possible during reading period. However, most of the grade depends on the problem sets and if you did well on the midterm do not worry too much about the final. My biggest advice for studying: I find reading the relevant lecture notes/textbook sections before lecture then come to lecture to ask questions then do problem sets to review the most helpful, or else having lecture be one's first introduction to some abstract material could be hard to understand. As for pset groups, I recommend trying to work with different people in the beginning of the year,;there is no shame in asking if other want to pset together as most people are willing to experiment, people start to form semi–fixed groups around week 4, though I continued to try pset with different people to make close friendships and that is totally possible as well.  Moreover, Tuesday nights and Wednesday nights at the math lounge you can always find people who are willing to work together.The CA's pset feedbacks were not the most helpful as they are always 5 weeks behind on grading the problem sets. But some sections/office hours are helpful and I highly recommend checking out as many of them out as possible in the beginning of the year to see which CAs you find the most helpful/vibe with.Overall, Math 55a is an amazing course!!! I highly recommend at least coming to a few lectures to check it out. Best of luck with Harvard and everything that comes with it!",0.9994,"The class is fun, but it's a lot of work and can be overwhelming if you fall behind on problem sets or don't have anybody to turn to when you're stuck on a problem.",-0.8151,"This class was my favorite course by far semester and we had a very good group of talented, interested students and an absolute gem of a professor.

When you do take the class, be warned that it's not great. The lectures are pretty dry. Each lecture just feels like a list of theorems with little motivation. And the proofs of the theorems in lecture are the kind of proof that doesn't follow a natural train of thought that you could think of yourself, instead seeming like someone just magically figured out that it works. Thankfully, the homeworks, while sometimes difficult, aren't too bad, so if you put in effort then you should do fine. There were many complaints about this class, which you'll probably see in the other comments, and they're all fair complaints. But there were some bright sides as well. Although most of the material is dry, the basic underlying concepts of measure theory and Lebesgue integration are very interesting. Also, Prof Yau was very lenient. He only assigned 8 homeworks, and whenever a homework was too long or a particular problem was too difficult, we asked the CAs to ask him to shorten the homework, extend the deadline, or remove the problem, and he always listened.

Course logistics were super disorganized too, and it was routine for us to renegotiate problem set deadlines and the problems of the problem sets. The midterm and finals were not cumulative and were focused on what we did in class just the week and a half before.

We covered linear algebra with a lot of rigor and I really liked the linear map–based approach in contrast to a matrix–centric approach. I definitely learned a lot! Math 121 covers roughly the same material as Math 25, but meets twice a week instead of three times; it works at the same level of rigor, but goes through material a little faster to fit everything in. I found the pace to be quite manageable. Ana is a really wonderful teacher – I've heard nothing but good things about her teaching, and I think that is true. She is incredibly organized and clear in her lectures. When introducing a new topic, she will often gauge the class's familiarity with some basic concepts, and she checks in with the class after the more convoluted proofs, making sure everyone is on the same page. The material is well motivated, rarely feeling arbitrary, which I really appreciated.The workload of this class was doable, but problem sets did take a fair bit of time to complete. There were a few particularly tricky questions scattered throughout the course, but this is Ana's first time teaching it, so I imagine such things are to be expected. While they were a lot of work, I really did learn a lot from them. One's first foray into abstract math can be difficult, and while the lectures were always understandable, I definitely did not feel solid on the psets at the beginning. I think this is to be expected, it is quite a transition. But learning how to make good use of office hours, and how to collaborate effectively with peers, is an incredibly important skill to learn, and office hours in particular helped me find my footing. So go to office hours, they were incredibly helpful! There are no answer keys for the problem sets, but CAs were always happy to answer any questions I had.The exams were generally reasonable, although I felt a little short for time when I took the midterms. Her grading was quite fair though. I do have to say though, I was not a huge fan of the grade breakdown for this course – the midterms and the final make up a combined 65% of your grade. Somewhat unfortunate. But oh well.I will say, if you are thinking about taking this course, check who is teaching it.

Also, a lot of times, the concepts we learned weren't motivated very well, so it felt a bit irrelevant and boring.

So, if you're looking for a nice math course to take, I would say you learn a good amount of material in the course but it is not overly challenging, and does not consume all your free time.",0.9946,I think this is a tough course only because it condenses too much material. I think in–person examination is a terrible idea at this level since the point shouldn't be to  evaluate how quickly one can do math under such stressful conditions (like a 3 hour exam). The PSETS are challenging and will take up a lot of time.,-0.743,,0.0,122603,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Mathematics,Mathematics,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Algebra I: Theory of Groups and Vector Spaces

I took this class after having taken Math 25a/b, which roughly covers material from Math 121 (Linear Algebra) and Math 112 (Real Analysis). Since this course teaches topology from the very definition of a topology and builds from there, I think the only hard prerequisite is a proof–writing course, like Math 22a+/100–level math course. But I HIGHLY RECOMMEND having taken real analysis––having a level of background dealing with the topology of R^n will allow you to appreciate the course a lot more, since you will be generalizing these concepts to a lot of wacky spaces (for instance, what does it mean for a function to be continuous between two topological spaces which aren’t necessarily metric spaces?). I also think it’s difficult to realize the significance of topology without having seen it in action in real analysis. As for the group theory prerequisite (Math 122), I’m unable to speak much about it since I have not taken a group theory class yet. Hefty group theory is only used only in the last quarter of the course, so I think it’s the softest prerequisite. That being said, I feel that my understanding of the later topics in algebraic topology are a little superficial, so having a background in group theory will definitely help you appreciate topology at a deeper level.The class is very well taught, and professor DeMarco provides extremely intuitive descriptions for topological concepts––which I would’ve not understood just by reading the textbook. Unlike previous math courses that I’ve taken, there is a very significant portion of the class where professor DeMarco explains topics using drawings, instead of writing out a long proof on the black board. Professor DeMarco really emphasizes the understanding of the subject, which is great for a subject like topology that is difficult to comprehend, but she does expect us to read the textbook outside of class so that we get acquainted with the language and the formalism that is used in the proofs. Some proofs in class might be a little abbreviated, or even skipped, so it’s important to refer to the textbook for details. The topics you learn in this class are extremely useful and general––and will appear everywhere in math, especially if taking analysis/topology courses in the future. I highly recommend taking 131 with professor DeMarco to fulfill your Geometry/Topology requirement, not only because it’s the most foundational topology course, but because professor DeMarco teaches you to think like a topologist, and will equip you with a very strong understanding of topology.",0.9956,"This class is very difficult.

He speeds through most of the beginning material to leave more time for the later topics on principal bundles and connections, which is quite a bad idea since by the time we reach said topics, we understand so little of what is going on earlier that there is a lot of difficulty understanding the later topics. The last two classes felt like absolute pop science to me, as he started dishing out many ideas from algebraic topology in addition to many modern theorems from differential geometry. I had no idea what I was supposed to get out of those classes except to ""see"" what the Yang–Mills equation was about. Furthermore, the textbook (Taubes) is really bad, and if you don't understand the material during lecture, don't even try to consult the textbook because it will definitely confuse you even more. Since he follows Taubes, trying to use another textbook (say Lee or Tu) proves to be quite challenging as well since the structure of the textbook is very different from the course material.

She shows clear favorites among the class and looks down mockingly and resentfully at the students who struggle a bit more with the material, never offering to actually help in any way. Finally, she cannot tell the difference between her Asian students and I honestly felt so bad watching her read a Chinese student’s name on the board and then look around for the nearest Asian person instead of even trying to get to know her students.

It is VERY important to stay on top of your work, and if you do, you can succeed. For context, I came in mainly having done research and science competitions in high school and also did well in the class so that is the perspective from which I'm providing advice. The first half of the class is chemistry so it is a lot more chemistry than the name implies. Also, there is an emphasis on applying the material as opposed to memorizing it. Also, it's a requirement so here's an objective review on what you can do to succeed in the course.There are a lot of moving parts to this course, so you need to stay on top of it.Problem Sets – Only piece of advice is to go do Psets in Sien's office hours or SSN. You can finish the entire thing and probably get 100% on all of the psets. Just go to Sien's office hours or SSN and start and finish. There is no need to sit by yourself and struggle over your upset with these resources. Office Hours – Go to Sien and Rebecca's office hours. They care so much about making sure you actually know the material and your wellbeing. Going to their office hours once will help clarify everything (I mean it) that you are confused about. On weeks you have lab assignments, you can often knock out the lab assignment and Pset before the weekend.Learning Pods – Read the textbook and stay ON TOP OF IT (taking notes) throughout the entire semester. I think this was the biggest differentiator between people who did relatively well and people who were stressing every time the finals rolled around. Learning pod videos are essentially a duplicate of the textbook material and so is lecture so you don't really need to pay attention. Lectures are meant to be supplementary (not where you learn the material) and just skip through the learning pod videos to the quiz unless you are confused by something in the textbook. Then it's nice to go back and watch the videos, but ONLY IF YOU ARE CONFUSED. Otherwise, it's a waste of time.Lectures – Lectures are often repeats of the textbook/learning pods but sometimes its nice to pay attention when they give out Pset help. Otherwise, do something more productive during lecture.PIEs – You have to learn how to take PIEs. Each question is trying to test you on a certain topic and if you can figure it out you'll be able to do it (aka do not overthink the problems). They are lowkey stressful because they are biweekly and they can be a lot when you have two of them sandwiched with a midterm. Do the practice PIE questions and take good notes because they are open notes. Also, in the grand scheme of things, each PIE is not worth that much (2%) and you do get a drop. Make sure you are careful and take it with a calm mind.Midterms – Midterms are very fair. There aren't any curveball questions and it feels like a longer PIE. The best studying you can do is to make a good cheat sheet by reviewing the labs, problem sets, section handouts, and your notes (they don't give practice midterms which is weird). Be aware though that they are pretty brutal with partial credit. It's also good to make your midterm cheat sheets online so that for future midterms your life is much easier. Final – They give you a practice final and I thought it was similar to the midterms in terms of fairness and what they expect you to know. Many questions are similar to the practice final.Section – If you read the textbook, then section might not be the most helpful but it's helpful to have a section leader who is good with grading because they are the ones who grade all of your assignments. Additionally, the handouts are useful because they often provide concise summaries. The most important thing with this course is to not drown in the details and section handouts help distill the core information and the broader patterns that LS1A wants you to know. It's super important to develop a sense of what these broader patterns that they are testing you on are.A dark side of LS1A is that they curve and sometimes this can mean down. In the past when there were no midterms and only open note PIEs, the cutoff for an A was between a 95 and 97 depending on who you ask. I don't know how midterms will factor into this (overall the midterm grades helped even out the distribution and I think will help the curve) but if you want a good grade, just follow the above advice and you'll be able to get an A. Just figure out how the course works and you will do well. Overall, I do think it is a good intro to bio and chem, it's just a lot",0.9976,"This class was very hard. I took AP Biology and Honors Chemistry in high school but was not prepared for the material we learned in this class. I also took time–consuming classes alongside it (a gem gen–ed Race and Justice,  Math 22a, CS50) so I never had enough time to fully learn all of the information so if you have a lighter course load than this class may be easier for you, though most of my friends did not like this class. I feel like lectures were not helpful and I had to heavily depend on section to learn the material. Watch the learning pods and take notes from them if you have time.

It is VERY important to stay on top of your work, and if you do, you can succeed. For context, I came in mainly having done research and science competitions in high school and also did well in the class so that is the perspective from which I'm providing advice. The first half of the class is chemistry so it is a lot more chemistry than the name implies. Also, there is an emphasis on applying the material as opposed to memorizing it. Also, it's a requirement so here's an objective review on what you can do to succeed in the course.There are a lot of moving parts to this course, so you need to stay on top of it.Problem Sets – Only piece of advice is to go do Psets in Sien's office hours or SSN. You can finish the entire thing and probably get 100% on all of the psets. Just go to Sien's office hours or SSN and start and finish. There is no need to sit by yourself and struggle over your upset with these resources. Office Hours – Go to Sien and Rebecca's office hours. They care so much about making sure you actually know the material and your wellbeing. Going to their office hours once will help clarify everything (I mean it) that you are confused about. On weeks you have lab assignments, you can often knock out the lab assignment and Pset before the weekend.Learning Pods – Read the textbook and stay ON TOP OF IT (taking notes) throughout the entire semester. I think this was the biggest differentiator between people who did relatively well and people who were stressing every time the finals rolled around. Learning pod videos are essentially a duplicate of the textbook material and so is lecture so you don't really need to pay attention. Lectures are meant to be supplementary (not where you learn the material) and just skip through the learning pod videos to the quiz unless you are confused by something in the textbook. Then it's nice to go back and watch the videos, but ONLY IF YOU ARE CONFUSED. Otherwise, it's a waste of time.Lectures – Lectures are often repeats of the textbook/learning pods but sometimes its nice to pay attention when they give out Pset help. Otherwise, do something more productive during lecture.PIEs – You have to learn how to take PIEs. Each question is trying to test you on a certain topic and if you can figure it out you'll be able to do it (aka do not overthink the problems). They are lowkey stressful because they are biweekly and they can be a lot when you have two of them sandwiched with a midterm. Do the practice PIE questions and take good notes because they are open notes. Also, in the grand scheme of things, each PIE is not worth that much (2%) and you do get a drop. Make sure you are careful and take it with a calm mind.Midterms – Midterms are very fair. There aren't any curveball questions and it feels like a longer PIE. The best studying you can do is to make a good cheat sheet by reviewing the labs, problem sets, section handouts, and your notes (they don't give practice midterms which is weird). Be aware though that they are pretty brutal with partial credit. It's also good to make your midterm cheat sheets online so that for future midterms your life is much easier. Final – They give you a practice final and I thought it was similar to the midterms in terms of fairness and what they expect you to know. Many questions are similar to the practice final.Section – If you read the textbook, then section might not be the most helpful but it's helpful to have a section leader who is good with grading because they are the ones who grade all of your assignments. Additionally, the handouts are useful because they often provide concise summaries. The most important thing with this course is to not drown in the details and section handouts help distill the core information and the broader patterns that LS1A wants you to know. It's super important to develop a sense of what these broader patterns that they are testing you on are.A dark side of LS1A is that they curve and sometimes this can mean down. In the past when there were no midterms and only open note PIEs, the cutoff for an A was between a 95 and 97 depending on who you ask. I don't know how midterms will factor into this (overall the midterm grades helped even out the distribution and I think will help the curve) but if you want a good grade, just follow the above advice and you'll be able to get an A. Just figure out how the course works and you will do well. Overall, I do think it is a good intro to bio and chem, it's just a lot",0.9976,"This class was very hard. I took AP Biology and Honors Chemistry in high school but was not prepared for the material we learned in this class. I also took time–consuming classes alongside it (a gem gen–ed Race and Justice,  Math 22a, CS50) so I never had enough time to fully learn all of the information so if you have a lighter course load than this class may be easier for you, though most of my friends did not like this class. I feel like lectures were not helpful and I had to heavily depend on section to learn the material. Watch the learning pods and take notes from them if you have time.

You learn a lot from a large variety of topics, some of which I had some background on before coming to college (cell cycle, genetics) and some of which I had never heard of (stat mech), but all of which we learned interesting new ways of thinking about. I was worried that I would not have enough math experience coming in, as I had only done up to AP calculus (while many I talked to had taken multi or linear algebra), but this was not the case. While almost every unit has a math based approach, most of the math is well weaved into the other topics, and I did not need more than my knowledge of integrals/derivatives from BC calc (they sometimes use more complicated stuff in lectures so that we can know where their values came from, but you typically don't need to know how to replicate them for assignments). Prior experience with Python or a similar coding language is helpful, but not necessary as they will review everything you need to know and there will inevitably be someone in your class who knows how to code and can help you. I was also worried because I did not have any research experience coming in, but this wasn't a big problem either. Most people in the class have lab experience, which made me feel inexperienced, but they talked us through everything we needed to know in lab, so it wasn't a big deal. In terms of the bio/chem/physics content, it is mostly bio, and you should be fine if you did well in high school AP bio/chem. The PSETs are difficult and you should start them early in the week and go to CA office hours, but they are not so long that you physically cannot finish them in the day or two before (it will just be a terrible experience), and there is only 1 a week (as opposed to the 4 a week you'd have between Math21a and LS1a). Organize study groups early in the year to make friends and stay on top of your work. LS50 is not the guaranteed bonding experience some of the Qreports make it out to be, but if you put in some effort to go to study sessions and talk to people in the class, you'll definitely meet some good friends.  The midterms (our year at least) are easier than the PSETs, so if you do well on them and the practice exam, you are probably well prepared. If you are worried about workload and settling into, you could take a GenEd and a Freshman Seminar (like I did) with LS50, but honestly, it was not as much work as I thought it would be and I wish I'd taken a harder 3rd class.  The professors, TFs, and CAs were all amazing our year (Andrew Murray was on sabbatical, so I can't say for him, but Michael, Emma, Ben, and Kara were fantastic). They all have regular office hours (though most fell in times I couldn't attend, so I suppose I can't speak to their quality) and give engaging lectures with helpful slides (well.... Michael's can be a bit hard to follow, but you the classes are recorded so you can just rewatch parts). The CAs and TFs also office hours/PSET sessions which are very helpfulI can't say much about the labs since they change every year, but getting to do original research for the first time was very cool (even if I don't want to look at another ant for the rest of my life), but three straight hours every tuesday on top of an hour of LS50 and potentially an hour of another class is A LOT, but it was doable once we got through the initial lecture based lab sessions. If you are in a lab section right after class, make sure to eat some lunch. The cafe on the first floor of Northwest has some decent food and accepts Board Plus.  LS50 will NOT take over your life. It will be a heavy time commitment, and you will have to study a lot, but it does not have to consume your every waking moment. I had plenty of time to join clubs, make friends, and relax (except maybe in the day or two right before a midterm). I highly recommend this class because your first semester can feel strange and overwhelming, and it's grounding to have a regular class that meets every weekday and is a similar size to high school classes. Overall, this class is not easy, but I don't think it is much harder than taking LS1a and a math course, and instead of two large, generic classes, you get a more unique and personal experience from the small class size and original research.",0.9982,,0.0,"If you have any intention of wanting to pursue research in the life sciences, this course is for you! Don't let the reputation of the course scare you – if you really love biology and you're ok with calculus (you don't have to love math – I didn't), the course is enough fun that it will feel like less work than it actually is. Now, that doesn't mean that you should overload your schedule – this course takes TIME – a lot of it – but it's a course that I was glad that I took not just at the end, but at every moment throughout the course, including at my toughest moments. The community that LS50 builds is incredible and the fun that you will have doing psets together and just hanging out will be some of the best fun of your first semester. Also, the lab, in my opinion, is the gem of the course – you get to do original research on incredibly interesting topics (for us, it was ant evolutionary biology!) in a very chill environment, which is such a rare opportunity for first–year undergrads. My main suggestion would be to go to ALL of the office hours – for all of the lecturers, all of the TFs, and all of the CA drop–in hours. Not only will it make everything so much easier, but the relationships that you build with the course staff in this tiny class are incredible and they're really great and nice people to get to know.",0.9948,159706,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Molecular & Cellular Biology,Life Sciences,Yes,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Integrated Science

The midterms (our year at least) are easier than the PSETs, so if you do well on them and the practice exam, you are probably well prepared. If you are worried about workload and settling into, you could take a GenEd and a Freshman Seminar (like I did) with LS50, but honestly, it was not as much work as I thought it would be and I wish I'd taken a harder 3rd class.  The professors, TFs, and CAs were all amazing our year (Andrew Murray was on sabbatical, so I can't say for him, but Michael, Emma, Ben, and Kara were fantastic). They all have regular office hours (though most fell in times I couldn't attend, so I suppose I can't speak to their quality) and give engaging lectures with helpful slides (well.... Michael's can be a bit hard to follow, but you the classes are recorded so you can just rewatch parts). The CAs and TFs also office hours/PSET sessions which are very helpfulI can't say much about the labs since they change every year, but getting to do original research for the first time was very cool (even if I don't want to look at another ant for the rest of my life), but three straight hours every tuesday on top of an hour of LS50 and potentially an hour of another class is A LOT, but it was doable once we got through the initial lecture based lab sessions. If you are in a lab section right after class, make sure to eat some lunch. The cafe on the first floor of Northwest has some decent food and accepts Board Plus.  LS50 will NOT take over your life. It will be a heavy time commitment, and you will have to study a lot, but it does not have to consume your every waking moment. I had plenty of time to join clubs, make friends, and relax (except maybe in the day or two right before a midterm). I highly recommend this class because your first semester can feel strange and overwhelming, and it's grounding to have a regular class that meets every weekday and is a similar size to high school classes.

It is also helpful that this is a small class, so you have a community of speakers who are at the same level that you are–––this helps with the language–learning process. For example, I would frequently exchange Arabic greetings with my classmates whenever I saw them outside of class. If there is one thing that I would say that this class falters in, it is that it has made me a far better writer than speaker.

I was scared to take this because I haven't studied neuroscience/biology since high school, but I felt really confident in the material. It did definitely help that I had taken Psy 1 though and took other psychology classes in high school so I knew a bit about neurons before going into this. Still though, I think they really transitioned you well into this course! Obviously, this could really depend on your TF though, so just be advised. I had Ya'el and she was AMAZING, so would definitely recommend you take this class and try to get her. This class does have a few more weekly assignments than what you may usually expect (watching like 2.5 hrs of lectures online every week, but you could just put it on 1.5 times speed to get it down to like a bit over an hour per week, a weekly PSET, along with an online quiz), so be ready for that. The quizzes are honestly easy and they are online + open notes, so you'll be fine. The PSETs can be a bit confusing, but I realized you can just go over them with your TF for like 5 mins after section and they'll be a breeze then. There is a midterm and final exam, along with 2 online tests, but the online ones are open note and the exams in class weren't too difficult in my opinion. Having a bunch of assignments in the end did help me feel more confident in my grade, so don't worry too much about it.

The readings for each class are low pressure and you usually don't need to know every detail but just the general goal of the paper. Go to office hours if you need help and Prof Kunes is happy to answer questions and he was a super nice teacher and even brought food in every morning for the class. Papers get put together easily if you have a good idea, so think of one early and clear it with Prof Kunes. Problem sets can be detailed, but answers are easy to find if you take notes on the readings and look through slides. Impossible to get a bad grade in this course if you pay even 50% attention in class.

For instance, before coming into this class, I enjoyed philosophy immensely,  but now I associate it with confusion and lack of understanding due to how fast the lecturer went over the material and how there was little to no focus on structuring papers.

No need to stress about your grade (lots of extra credit opportunities). Some great readings. SUCH good films––watch them even if you don't take the class. Would be great to take Freshman year.Cons: A lot of gesturing to the significance of texts in your daily lives without gaining a very deep or clear understanding of what the texts are actually saying. Section is fun but not very enlightening. It sometimes felt like Prof. Kelly misinterpreted student objections to simplify things more quickly (a relief in lecture sometimes if it was a tangent, but otherwise a con). De Beauvoir and Fanon felt like they were only glossed at the end (not in time to write about them for either paper). You have to write about The Brothers Karamazov for the second paper.

In my experience, it is unfortunately rare to encounter such a positive and warm environment in Harvard so, even if you have no academic reason to take the course, I recommend this class as a way of meeting some incredibly kind people and think about how you can grow as a person.",0.9787,"This class is not specifically about virtue ethics.

However, while these are the broad topics discussed, it does not feel like that. It feels like an overview course in which every week you read a different selection, and readings are not related too closely. If you are looking for a broader theory about virtue or vice, this course will present you many such theories, but will not help to decide how or which to pick. You will gain familiarity with many new ideas, and you'll probably end up feeling more disoriented than you started. That can be a good thing.

I have never taken a class in which I felt so passionately about the readings. I was unable to finish all of them, and I am committed to complete them during winter break (I have never done that before). It is a testament to how great the readings are that this was my favorite class, even though the seminar component was lacking. In a way, I do feel that I would have gotten almost as much out of the class as I did even if I had been unable to attend the seminar discussions and only had to read and write essays.

I would have taken at least one upper level philosophy class before this, in an analytic style (Heidegger or history of philosophy will not be the best prep) – philosophy of language would probably be best because it’s very closely tied to metaethics. There’s also a lot of work in this class – three essays, first one has a rewrite, and there’s a three hour final exam where the questions aren’t easy. The grading is also firm.

To start, I appreciated the intentionality in the course. In terms of the content, I am grateful for the connections that the course makes between physics and medicine/biology to highlight how a course that may not be the direct focus of students' studies can be relevant and important to what they are interested in. I thought the course staff did a great job in choosing problems that were relevant to our interests and helped us to better understand the world around us. Secondly, I think the way they presented information was very intentional and important. I think it was helpful to learn about some of the material taught in class before that class began and then to have an opportunity to review that content at the start of class and build on what we learned through practice problems and the opportunity to ask questions in class. I found the teaching staff (the lecturers and the TFs/CAs) to be particularly incredible. I found Anna and Greg to be especially caring, thoughtful, and kind and the other members of the teaching staff to be supportive as well. I am very grateful for the enthusiasm and engagement that Anna and Greg brought to the classroom and how much they cared about our wellbeing. I learned a lot during this class and felt excited about the material and very much supportive throughout the semester. I also thought that the lab was great in being able to introduce other content related to what we learned in class that was important to use in physics and relevant to concepts from other disciplines. I very much appreciated the opportunity to learn about and practice using the scientific process and experimenting.

However, I do recommend you take it during a semester when you aren't as busy. I took this as my fifth class during a very busy semester and it was not my best idea. Especially toward the end of the course (last 4–6 weeks), the assignments get bigger/harder (at least for me, not necessarily for everyone), and I was so stressed about being able to get things done and semi–functioning by their due dates. However, the course staff is super flexible, understanding, kind, and supportive. When you inevitably run into issues trying to get something to work or figure out how to do something, you should definitely turn to Google, YouTube, and other peoples' projects and websites first. Then, definitely talk to/message the TFs or Nathan, who are so helpful. It's also very useful to chat with them about your plans for projects so they can give you their recommendations and expertise. Finally, be sure to start your documentation early: ideally, you'd do it as you go. Creating thorough documentation is vital for succeeding in the course (and also just generally useful).",0.9807,,0.0,,0.0,215717,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Physics,Physical Sciences,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Introduction to Digital Fabrication

It was an absolutely amazing experience. Professor Barandes is an incredibly welcoming and understanding person, and has several unparalleled qualities about him, including that he is able to remember so much information and relevant stories that are carefully conveyed and intelligently woven into his lectures.  He is unbelievably knowledgeable, and he will stay for literally an hour or two afterwards and answer questions, and explain new topics to you. He really cares. Furthermore, it speaks for itself that that he was able to consolidate and really encapsulate the essence of almost every major realm of physics leading up to (and including, which was really cool!!) the development of quantum mechanics in an accessible but thorough and un–simplified way. By covering in broad sweeps all of the important realms of physics from throughout its past, this class was in a lot of ways a history of physics, and felt like a 31–course intellectual meal. Every lecture provided something new and exciting. Now, I took 15a before this course, but as someone with a passion for learning and a curiosity about a lot of disciplines in science, I felt that I wanted a class that showed me what physics 'is about'. And physics 19 sure delivered. This was unlike any other introductory STEM class I've taken; this helped me solidify my choice to study physics.  I feel this class should be required alongside physics 15a, they're really each of a very different breed, and this class is just fantastic. For the physics student, 15a teaches you how to think about and solve classical mechanics and special relativity problems well. This is important. Physics 19 sends you on an intellectual rollercoaster and makes you question and think about the philosophical experience of understanding the inner workings of the universe. This is important for a deeper reason. It gets you excited about studying physics; I had my intellectual and physics boundaries pushed in so many different directions, leaving me feeling like I gained a tender awareness of what physics 'is about', the soul of it, this ever–growing tapestry of knowledge, as seen through so many other historical figures who gave their lives to its development and all it can now account for in Nature. And again: it's accessible! You don't actually need to have taken a physics course before this! Having an interest in physics is all that is necessary, and being interested in deep questions is a plus––Barandes' specialty is physics and philosophy, and this combines both.",0.9972,"I wouldn't recommend this class unless you're really into physics and math. As an engineer, lectures got really hard really fast and it was tough to catch up. Additionally, PSets took up a lot of my time and seemed to be really repetitive and a bit excessive in terms of workload. I think I thought this class would be a lot more theoretical and involve writing and stuff like that, but it's literally just a lot a lot of math.",-0.2612,"If you are reading this, I assume you have some level of interest in physics. If you have any interest in physics, please take this course. Therefore, if you are reading this, please take this course. Physics 19 is an absolute gem of a class, and I promise you will not regret taking it. Professor Barandes is genuinely one of the kindest and wisest teachers I've ever had, and if you do take this course, I encourage you to block out some time to stay after class and simply talk with him. He is incredibly knowledgable and somehow manages to make very complicated and high–level topics understandable for a beginning physics student, or really anybody interested in the topic. Another thing that I think is important to mention is that although this class is many things, it is certainly not a slog at any point. It is fast paced and can definitely be hard to understand sometimes, but Professor Barandes somehow manages to keep everything interesting, and it leaves you wanting to learn more.

The focus is not really on solving problems per se but understanding classical mechanics as a whole. Professor Jaffe develops the material in a very rigorous way, and I really gained a lot of appreciation for physics more broadly. This was a chance to push classical mechanics to its limits. I think the course is well organized, with an emphasis on symmetries a common thread throughout. The last couple weeks we branched out and talked briefly on a number of different topics and closed the course in a transitionary way between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. As far as the lectures go, I found them to be quite good. It is very clear that Professor Jaffe is incredibly knowledgeable on this subject, and truly enjoys teaching. He will smile with glee as he derives an elegant result ('the matrix is Hermitian!'), and he starts every class by asking for questions – he wants the class to be engaged. He tries not to start without answering at least one question, which may be a tad awkward when nobody has any to offer, but it really is a great chance to make sure you're actively engaging with the material, and so if you take the class, come with questions! Quite honestly, I think this is a practice that should be done in every class.Professor Jaffe wrote very extensive and rigorous lecture notes, that take the place of a textbook for this course. He reworks them every year (!), and it is clear he cares a lot about having a good set of notes. In the process of rewriting them, some typos do get through, but he often finds them quite quickly and is fast to resolve them. While at times a typo can be a little frustrating, for better or for worse they do serve as good checks, to make sure you really understand that material and aren't just skimming through it on a surface level.  That notwithstanding, the notes are quite thorough and in–depth – a very useful resource indeed! His notes often go into more depth than in lecture (doing all derivations explicitly, etc.), or approach the problem in a different way, providing multiple approaches on a particular issue which can be quite useful. There was a topic or two for which I felt I'd benefit from additional outside reading, and David Tong's lecture notes have come highly recommended as a supplement to Prof. Jaffe's. But in general, I found his notes to be quite good, and the exercise of reading through them carefully (including derivations) to check my understanding was quite helpful. Also, I like Professor Jaffe. He is quite approachable, and always happy to talk. He's very nice, passionate, and an incredible physicist. Go to his office hours!Section was great, Ahmed was very thoughtful in what he went over, and it was a great opportunity to solidify ideas from lecture etc. And Ahmed was just very nice and helpful throughout the course, a great TF!Problem sets were not weekly, but every few weeks or so. Keep that in mind when looking at the hours/week. I personally liked this arrangement; physics nights were a great chance to knock out a good chunk of the pset. They were generally reasonable, although some of the derivations got quite tedious. Doable, but at times a lot of algebra/calculus, not necessarily the most fun. The cancellation was very satisfying when it worked out, but it often took some 'bashing.' Tests were not too bad, although at times I felt a little unsure of what to study. Professor Jaffe was quite clear on the topics that would be on the test, but we went into such depth in class that it was hard to know what extent of the material we needed to be comfortable with. I have to say, I think the grade breakdown was very fair, and I am quite fond of it. Tests were weighted enough that one did genuinely care about them and study hard, but at the same time weighted lightly enough that one was not unduly stressed. I think Professor Jaffe really has found a very good balance in the grade breakdown. I also am a fan of the final projects. I think it was a great opportunity to actually learn through doing, rather than focusing simply on regurgitating material. I know I learned a lot in my project and solidified a lot of ideas from the course by really applying them rigorously.Now, to talk about prerequisites. It's good to have some background with abstract linear algebra, but most things can be picked up along the way if needed. Also, basic vector calculus etc. As far as physics experience goes, I think it would be good to be at least familiar with Lagrangians, although not absolutely necessary. A lot of people were not exposed to them before and seem to have done well, yet I personally found it very helpful to have had some experience with them. More broadly, it's good to have had some classical mechanics background before this course, though not absolutely necessary. While the course may be doable without, I think one gets a lot more out of 151 with some such background than one would otherwise.I'm very glad I took this course and would recommend it!

Jess is an excellent professor, and nearly all of my critiques of the class are critiques of the research literature itself.Out of all my classes, Jess is the professor who cares about my learning the most. It's not even close. She's given so much detailed feedback and structured the assignments in a way where I actually put in the work to get things out of the class. If you don't want to do the readings for a class, don't take it. The weekly readings are fairly reasonable and can get done in 30–60 minutes, so it's really not a big deal.The class itself is 2 hours and usually split equally between lecture about the weekly emotion regulation topics and discussion led by other students in the class. There are no phones/computers allowed and the discussions can be pretty fun, but sometimes because the class is so long it can drag. It's very nice that it only meets once a week, though.Emotion regulation research is very early. Some of the studies we reviewed are not nearly as rigorous or interesting as I'd hoped, and it felt that a majority of the field's findings converged on a few emotion regulation strategies (e.g.,, reappraisal, suppression, etc.). Moreover, the curriculum could've focused more on how to apply these findings – how can you *actually* improve emotion regulation in yourself or others? How can you spot good/bad emotion regulation behaviors? TLDR: definitely take the class if you like the topic, Jess is great",0.9911,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

In the first week, this course made me absolutely terrified. I came in with no prior Spanish knowledge, and the Spanish professors speak exclusively in Spanish (from day one)! Be prepared to be challenged linguistically, and remember that YOU decide how much you get out of this course. You can probably do fine (and maybe even get a better grade) if you stick to the simplest sentence structures, vocabulary, and grammar, but you will learn a lot more if you push yourself to use more complex structures and vocabulary, even if it means you might miss a few points on a test or interview. The work in this class is not overwhelming, but you should probably write down or at least make note of all of the due dates at the beginning of the course. They are not evenly spaced out, so you might find yourself having no work outside of class one week, but having work outside of class every day in another week. Also, if you aren't sure that Spanish is right for you, you might consider how much time you're willing to devote to learning the language (well). The Spanish department requires a 95+ to get an A for the GPA, but this is not the same for other languages (93 for an A is Harvard ""norm,"" and those 2 points really can make it all the more challenging to get an A). Keep that in mind.Above all, the small class size (about 15 students) and amount of time spent (four days a week) has made this course feel like a family. Our instructor, Andrea, has been nothing short of fantastic. I really admire her for all the work she puts into this course (because she is also incredibly busy outside of this course!). I feel confident that I could communicate effectively in a Spanish–speaking country or community after just one short semester of Spanish. Be prepared to work hard, but remember that the end goal is simple: learning as much Spanish as you can in order to communicate with other Spanish speakers! Don't get too caught up in the homework or exams, and remember that this is a new language. You aren't meant to know everything from the beginning. I got really frustrated a few times this year, but something has really clicked in the past few weeks and everything has really started to make sense. This class has inspired me to pursue a Spanish citation, and I've also been able to find some really amazing Spanish music that is now always on repeat while I study or just listen to music for fun! ¡Buena suerte!",0.978,Be careful about the section attendance.

You also do ""tertulias"" with 1–2 other students once a week and get to meet and tie up loose ends from class, which is helpful since you only meet once a week. The readings can be dense and hard to understand at times, since they are from the 19th/20th century. I had to look up a lot of words and sometimes, English translations. If you're not a native speaker, make sure you feel fairly confident in your reading skills and/or are willing to put in the work to understand the readings.

This class has a weekly theme in which the works we read or movies we watch revolve around. We would meet twice a week for small group (~8 students) discussions. I really enjoyed the focus on discussion where we, the students, could push the conversation to whatever subjects piqued our interests. It's an added bonus that the intimate nature of the class allowed us to get to know one another very well, and Professor Sandler is fantastic at facilitating discussion. She's like the tour guide that leads us through these different works and her expertise and openness to interpretation was always appreciated as it can be difficult to dissect ""strange"" texts. It was gratifying to see how our initial thoughts were developed throughout the discussion and by the end of each class, we came away with these profound insights. It's a big credit toward Professor Sandler and my awesome class that we could develop a diverse variety of interpretations, find the connections, and come away with an understanding that you just can't get when thinking alone. Additionally, the majority of the works we read were short stories and poems. You will definitely come away with at least a couple new authors you want to keep reading in the future! In terms of assignments, we had response/creative papers of varying lengths (anywhere from 2–5 pages usually) that were given every couple weeks in addition to a final paper.  To me, this system worked since the papers would help reinforce each couple weeks' worth of material.  They were also a nice opportunity to take a deeper dive into a works that particularly caught your attention.  Overall, I'm grateful to have taken this course and it was always a pleasure to go to discussion and get into the readings each week. Professor Sandler is brilliant, empathetic, and passionate about what she teaches, it's easy to see, and I think you could take any class with her and find it to be an immensely rewarding experience. Not to mention that she is so kind and supportive of all her students. In retrospect, I think exploring Russian literature through strange writers is perhaps the best way to get into it. You'll see what I mean if you take the class. Finally, Russia can often be misunderstood especially because of its rich and complex history. This class was integral in helping me navigate the biggest themes related to Russia, learning how to make sense of them, and ultimately, I gathered enough of an understanding to feel capable in continuing to explore Russia, strange writers, and Russian literature in the future. It's a great feeling. I'm thankful to have been able to take a class like this as it has added to my appreciation for a culture that I probably couldn't have made sense of on my own. Definitely would encourage those curious to take this course!",0.9993,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

Personally, I haven't, but after having taken Complit 153, I think I have an idea of what it must be like. In an opera, a singer comes on stage and performs some piece of music with tremendous passion, and although you have no idea what they were saying, you still nod to your friends, say it's good, and applaud because you appreciate the art of it. Similarly, in Complit 153, Professor Weir enters the lecture hall, talks in highly elevated diction for an hour and a half about some sophisticated–sounding topics, and although you have no idea what he's saying, you still try to jot down notes and nod to your friends because you appreciate the art of it. But what exactly is this art? It is the art of quoting from other scholars: When he explicates an interpretation, he makes sure to include as many sources of Nabokov scholarship as he can. He often always throws in a dash of Russian as well, just to add some interlingual insight. It is the art of improvisation: Arrive early enough and you will get a sneak peek of Complit 153 behind the scenes. Fifteen minutes to 6:45, Prof. Weir enters the premises. Five minutes to 6:45, Prof. Weir walks in and flips frantically through all 60 pages of his notes. At 6:45, Professor Weir begins his performance. It is the art of speed: Prof. Weir always has many more notes than he has minutes in class, but they don't call him the ""master chef"" for no reason. He always cooks up an incredible stew, expertly blending together scholarly ideas, usually relying on the last 10 minutes as a speedround to ""popcorn"" from person to person as they collectively crowdsource just about every insight to be had. It is the art of abstraction: His handwriting is illegible. But most importantly, it is the art of the simple: Behind the facade of the multilined model with thousands of different facets, there's always a really simple Nabokovian principle. Some of my favorites include: all art is flawed art, unless it's Pushkin's or Nabokov's; Freud is awful and any character who agrees with him is awful; nature (especially the butterfly) is beautiful; and of course the hermeneutics of perversion. Comparative Literature can be so wonderful. This was my first comparative literature class at Harvard, but after taking it, I became confused as to why people call comparative literature majors ""losers,"" unless a loser is just someone who wrestles with a text long enough to extract an insight about the world.In all honesty, this class has topics that are really interesting, but they are often presented in a way that blurs the fine detail and focuses on the big themes instead. I am a fan of the post–lecture 1–hour class discussion where we consider the artistic and political aspects of the text and this part is usually pretty well–done, even though the conclusion will be something obvious (funny). Lectures themselves often move too quickly as a result of the large number of literary buzzwords that are not explained in much detail (and time taken up by the class discussion). It is unfortunate that there is no textbook because there is no way to explore the material presented in class and get a better understanding except by combing through the books Prof. Weir quotes from, which are usually behind a paywall. Essays are pretty good both as a learning tool and in terms of content (they usually remind me of something from popular culture like Queen's Gambit or Stanley Kubrick that we then compare with the novel), although I wish the page length on them was just a little more high. I feel uncomfortable when I take notes for an essay and I am able to fit my notes on only 3 lines (with the paper in landscape orientation). In–class pop quizzes seem unexpected at first, but they actually happen just about every week an essay is due, so it's hard to be unpleasantly surprised. The weekly workload varies wildly, since Professor Weir assigns either most of a 200–page novel in addition to a two hour movie or just a couple pages' worth of selected excerpts to reread. He put the weekly homework on the course page weeks before we had to do this and this was actually what we did, leading many to be very happy. As a result work is pretty predictable, so don't be too sad if you don't have time to get it all done one week, chances are you can catch up in the week following.If you want to take this class, make sure you know a bit about Nabokov, make sure you know your Russian early–20th–century politics and Russian idioms, and that's basically it. It's quite accessible really, once you actually find it in the course catalog.",0.9982,Nabokov is brilliant but his perspective might startle you,-0.1406,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

The readings are –incredibly– difficult, but also some of the most interesting and eye–opening I have had the pleasure of studying. Charles is a really fantastic teacher, so there were days I came in having read 0 words of the assigned readings and still was able to learn and participate. This is because he provides a handout where he identifies short passages with key takeaways, so whenever the reading is too difficult or people don't have a lot to say, he'll just direct us to close read the key passages together. Every tutorial should be run this way, but I find other tutors in 10 and 98 have this complex about not ""giving students the answers"" which just makes it awkward and useless when no one has read or the reading was too hard. I find that the approach where there is always close reading to fall back on makes every minute of class actually worthwhile and actually incentivizes students to read more.  When we get to see how generative a discussion can be when we are unprepared, we are inspired by that to dig deeper for the next week. Another thing I loved about this course is that Charles cut out all the unnecessary assignments from the syllabus, so the only thing you really need to do throughout the semester is show up and think about your term paper.

Tracey is the goat fr fr, she straight up does not miss. If you’re like me, then this class is going to go from very good to phenomenal. If you aren’t (totally fine!), it might go to good.This class is very theory heavy while still being grounded. There’s a lot of psychoanalysis, a lot of neoliberalism, some marx, a good amount of sociological theory, etc… Im very theory pilled, so I loved the readings, but if you aren’t, it might not be the class for you BUT at the same time Tracey helps orient theoretical discussions around the actual happenings of the world, which keeps things grounded and present. I don’t mean to make it sound all theory (it really isn’t!!!), but it’s definitely the most theoretical class I’ve had that still ostensibly about ethnographies and studying particular societal trends.The class is about entrepreneurialism in the loosest of senses. We read about entrepreneurialism in the first week, then we never really discussed it again (which I honestly didn’t mind one bit.) It’s really a class about identity formation under capitalism. And, as mentioned, it is also very theoretical, so ideally for people who like theory and like Freud, Foucault, Butler, etc… I will also say that though the more theoretical texts DO connect with the more ethnographic readings (which come mainly in the second half) the connections are not always explicitly drawn. My personal only real complaint is that in class presentations from other students were quite long. TLDR; Tracey is a great great teacher, if you like studying theory, psychoanalysis, identity formation, and capitalism as not just an economic system, it’ll probably be a GOAT class, if you don’t, probably still quite good, but know what you’re getting into.",0.9948,,0.0,,0.0,220409,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Social Studies,Social Studies,,Social Sciences,,Tutorial,"Capitalism, Subjectivity, and the ""Entrepreneurial Self"""

She listens and appreciates everything each student says, and she is more than willing to meet with you about any question or concern. Many professors say this, but with Gili, you feel encouraged to meet not out of obligation but because you know it will benefit you. The structure of each class is really helpful because she outlines where you will go and what information you should take away from each part of the lesson. The readings are also super interesting, and lots of the history you discuss seems like stuff you should have been taught about in previous courses but never got the chance to learn. The assignments of this course are SUPER helpful when drafting your final paper. I love that we learned about historiographies and primary source analyses and could just use the assignments we had already written as sections of our final paper. This was also really helpful because we had already gotten feedback on parts of our final paper when we started drafting it.

More generally though, you just have to complete a certain number of weekly posts, make a group presentation for a book, and write the midterm + final papers. Overall, I would recommend this course!!

The reading selections are very interesting, and the classes serve to outline the readings and how they connect to the theme. Thus, if you don't actually do the readings every week, you may as well not take the class (the readings take 30–75 minutes a week). The papers are a little tricky because you really have to produce a novel idea, but that's not inherently bad. The grading thus far has been slightly harsh in my opinion, especially since a majority of the class has never taken a sociology class before (of course haven't gotten my final grade back). Rachel Meyer (prof) is very passionate about the topic and her enthusiasm is infectious. She definitely is left–leaning and is not afraid to express it. She's less available outside of class than I'd like, but she made up for it by having Rachel Kim as her TF, who is probably my favorite TF of all time. If Rachel Kim is TFing the class, then it's a no–brainer to take, because Rachel's sections were so thoughtful and really made the class for me.

I came into this class as an Economics concentrator, without ever having taken CS50 (admittedly because I was scared of computers), and only a brief encounter with using python and pandas for a network analysis. I had a lot of experience with economic research in R, and the PhD student I worked for recommended CS109 as one of the most useful classes he had done in his doctoral degree (also hadn't learnt python before). I came in scared that I wouldn't have the background to succeed, but sticking with this class was THE BEST DECISION I made. If you don't have much experience with coding, use HW0 as an opportunity to learn. It's very comprehensive, if you find a friend who can also help you understand the concepts and you use the Data Science Bedrock materials Pavlos provides, you'll learn Python really quickly. By the end of the class, I felt extremely proficient in my coding abilities, could complete all the homeworks quickly and without any problems, and honestly am super grateful that I had the opportunity to practice so much coding in college. The material I learnt was also extremely helpful for other classes, such as Ec 1126, and it helped me develop hard skills which I later plan to use for research/jobs.I left this class now in Am/Ec and considering a secondary in CS because there are simply too many other courses I want to take. This was a great introduction to data science and I highly recommend anyone who wants more experience with handling data to take this course. If you're not super comfortable with coding, just make sure you are willing to put in the hours (particularly in the beginning) and you'll do fine.",0.9969,"Don't take this class.

I had a lot of experience with economic research in R, and the PhD student I worked for recommended CS109 as one of the most useful classes he had done in his doctoral degree (also hadn't learnt python before). I came in scared that I wouldn't have the background to succeed, but sticking with this class was THE BEST DECISION I made. If you don't have much experience with coding, use HW0 as an opportunity to learn. It's very comprehensive, if you find a friend who can also help you understand the concepts and you use the Data Science Bedrock materials Pavlos provides, you'll learn Python really quickly. By the end of the class, I felt extremely proficient in my coding abilities, could complete all the homeworks quickly and without any problems, and honestly am super grateful that I had the opportunity to practice so much coding in college. The material I learnt was also extremely helpful for other classes, such as Ec 1126, and it helped me develop hard skills which I later plan to use for research/jobs.I left this class now in Am/Ec and considering a secondary in CS because there are simply too many other courses I want to take. This was a great introduction to data science and I highly recommend anyone who wants more experience with handling data to take this course. If you're not super comfortable with coding, just make sure you are willing to put in the hours (particularly in the beginning) and you'll do fine.",0.9969,"Don't take this class.

It's not the same as AP Stat (in fact way, way, way far away from it) in that it teaches probability, so keep that in mind if you're looking to learn statistics for data science. It's hard. Did I say it's hard? It's really hard. But rewarding. Joe is a fantastic lecturer, and I think it honestly should be a gold standard in terms of how classes should be organized. 9–12 AM office hours and sections every day, Joe (or another person in the class) explains every single post on Ed at lightning speed, the 3 hour midterm/final reviews that TFs hold; it's really fantastic! Three things:1. For the love of God don't do what I did; please read the textbook early. Do the problems in them. The problems are hard when you begin, but you'll thank yourself when midterms and finals roll around and you can actually solve the problems in the practice exams. Think the textbook is insurmountable when you're trying to read it to get those PSETS in? It's ~expo(nentially) worse when you try to cram 7 chapters in 2 days. 2. Speaking of practice exams, for midterms and finals, do. all. the practice. exams. Please. They'll be your saving grace. Somehow Joe writes a new midterm and final every year, so he releases all the old midterms from the previous year all the way back to the dinosaur ages. They're so helpful, and there are patterns that repeat themselves. Do them (and not with the answer key in front of you so you gaslight yourself into feeling like you know the answer and that you could get the answer on an exam. Nothing more frustrating than knowing you saw the literal exact problem structure and looked at the answer key, but actually don't know how to solve it. It's devastating.) 3. Go to the 200 office hours that are available! And go to section. I know it's hard because it's not assigned, but the TFs are absolutely fantastic. And they'll make figuring out the PSET way faster.This class can be a monster at times, but it's worth it. Somehow by the end, it transforms half of the class into stat concentrators, so take that as you will. Good luck soldier may Joe bless you with intuition and a lot of time to study for this class.",0.9941,"DO NOT TAKE. AVOID AT ALL COSTS UNTIL THEY CHANGE IT.TL;DR: The material is interesting, but the execution of the class is so bad you could literally read the textbook and not do anything else and gain about the same amount of information on probability as you would otherwise. Joe's lovely though.The Good:Blitzstein's a good lecturer, he's funny, likes to joke with the class, and very human. Very generous extension, drop, and grading policy, and he does have his heart in the right place. The material is also interesting and has many connections (too bad literally none of them are explored lmao).The Bad:This course wants to be an intro course while teaching material that is not intro–level, and definitely not at an intro–level pace. Do not listen to the requirements, if you don't have multivariable calculus or some notion of linear algebra you will not be able to fully understand and appreciate the material, especially in the latter half of the semester, where it's all calculus and Markov chains are entirely linear algebra. It also sits at a crossroads between rigorous and unrigorous maths; proofs are required in PSETS and exams but it is never explained how one should get to such proofs, some results are entirely opaque and not even the TFs understand them, and story proofs have a special place in hell. The textbook is terrible and proof–laden, which is incredibly counterproductive and does not serve students. Practice problems are useless since you don't have the solutions to them. All the material pre–midterm does not require actual logic but rather rote memorization of the examples in lecture and the textbook, which artificially deflates grades and makes the course a lot harder than it needs to be. The midterm is not useful in any way for a thorough understanding of the material and relies solely on being lucky about what topics are drawn. The class is also completely different pre– and post–midterm in terms of intensity and PSET difficulty, messing up students' plans and greatly increasing the amount of time needed. For evidence of this, look to 80% of the TFs, whom all say they did terribly on the midterm and then great on the final. Also, a standard deviation of over 20 points is insane.Lectures are useless. Blitzstein is a good lecturer and can get his points across, but there's no point in going if everything he says is on the textbook anyway, literally word–for–word the same. PSETS have little to do with what is actually being taught that week and are always a weird mix, especially post–midterm, of stuff you did the week prior and stuff you're covering the week of the PSET. They also vary wildly in terms of time commitment, with in most recent memory, PSETs 9  and 10 being day and night, respectively.The course is structured such that there is no natural connection between topics even though there can definitely be one, which makes the material uselessly frustrating to wrap one's head around.Section is not useful in the slightest, and there is so little publicity for it anyway that one can go the entire course without going and it would not make a difference. Office Hours also suffer from the same issues, with TFs not being much help and the bulk of the benefit of OHs being finding a PSET group, because even though this class is 800 people you might as well be the only one taking it due to the lack of communication between students.",-0.9467,,0.0,110766,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Statistics,Statistics,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Introduction to Probability

The course's focus was algorithms like PCA, SVD, NMF, ISOMAP, and then some stuff on clustering, with LOTS of linear algebra and a bit of theoretical background (but no proofs), and in some places felt like it was running pretty slow; we spent like the first 3 weeks talking about PCA, which kind of dragged on.

It's a really interesting continuation of the topics that Stat 110 covers but in greater depth and rigor. Reasoning by representation (e.g, proving results by connecting different distributions) is really powerful and interesting, and the measure theoretic foundation that Stat 210 provides makes probability (at least in my opinion) more intuitive but also more rigorous. Problem sets are fair and interesting, and exams are reasonable (the midterm was fair, and the final felt generous – I know it's been a bit harder in previous years though).Overall, the course feels more like an upper–level undergraduate class compared to a graduate class – both in content and in enrollment. From what I know, for better or for worse, the course differs a bit from other schools' graduate probability classes: it's less focused on measure theory (e.g., spends less time on rigorous constructions of parts of probability) and more focused on providing intuitive results and explanations. It also at times awkwardly balances between doing analysis (e.g., when proving the CLT) and not doing analysis (e.g., handwaving parts of measure theory and MGFs). I'd definitely still recommend taking some form of analysis before this class – the class is definitely doable without it, but Math 25/55/112 or equivalent makes the course much more understandable (especially when it comes to topics like CLTs and LLNs). Also, taking Math 114 at the same time as this course is underrated – it makes the measure theory parts of this course so much more understandable, and depending on who teaches Math 114, it'll make the end of that class a whole lot easier too.Last bit because I would've liked to have a review like this when I was looking at the QGuide: I self–studied Stat 110 over the summer by watching the Youtube lectures, doing the psets, and reading the textbook – in the end, I felt really well–prepared for Stat 210, and I think that it was a good move to take Stat 210. I came from a Math 25 background, and even though Stat 210 can be/sound a little intimidating, it's definitely doable, and if you already know some probability and like analysis, it's a jump worth considering. On the flip side, if your Stat 110 knowledge isn't fairly solid or you're not too confident in basic probability, Stat 210 will be a bit challenging.

Sometimes it feels like he explains really basic knowledge because it's easier to explain than the more complicated stuff, but this is unhelpful because what you truly need help understanding is what kind of random variable the quasi likelihood model is actually supposed to represent and why you can’t write it down as a probability distribution (is it because the PDF doesn't integrate to 1 and just needs a normalizing constant? We still don't know!).The exams are only one hour long, which is truly not enough time to do any problem solving. You also can't bring a theorem sheet. As a result, they ignore all but roughly two lectures’ worth of material, and only test how fast you can take a derivative, do tricks with matrices, or recall the specific wording of definitions. There is less than 10 points of variance between the min and max project grades, and project grades are capped at 95, since higher scores are reserved for “publication worthy” papers, even though the project is supposed to be a literature review and nowhere do the guidelines mention expecting novel results. Thus, the class grade is basically completely determined by the two *one–hour* exams.Furthermore, the TFs were unhelpful. The review sessions were not intelligible because they were drawing on a Zoom whiteboard with a laptop touchpad. They were extremely stingy with pset grading, and took off points for typos and ""poor choice of wording,"" even if the ideas are clear. It is also quite insulting that one TF expressed the belief the students taking the class this year were just a ""dumb"" group of students, hence why they thought Stat 244 was better as a 20–student class because the material ""didn't get any harder"" from last year and seemed to not understand why everyone can't “just do better on the midterm."" Mind you, the course material is not rocket science. If the students in the course, who are generally graduate students in statistics–related fields and competent undergraduates who succeeded in stat 210/211, can’t figure out the basics of generalized linear models, it might not be because they are “dumb.”I am not usually so annoyed by teaching styles, and this is the first time in several semesters at Harvard that I have expressed such a vehement level of distaste in a Q guide review. Stat 244 epitomizes all the bad things about taking classes: learning techniques that aren't particularly novel (and might not lead to interesting research directions), but in a convoluted way, and banging your head against the wall to complete pset problems that are all just quite random linear algebra tricks, and being tested on how fast you can reason about the four fundamental spaces of a matrix like a juvenile high schooler. This class was such a bad experience that it has made me jaded about continuing to take more classes that could turn out to be like this one and has motivated me to take time off from school.",0.9388,"Thought this would be more interesting, albeit more difficult, than STAT139. This was not true. A lot of results and work done in the homework is very tedious and doesn't add to understanding. Closed note exams are annoying when it's mostly proof–based.

Amie gives very interesting lectures and really knows her stuff. The course has heavy focuses on not just the biology aspect of aging, but also the social/political consequences of it (without the course getting political) as well as drug development. I would recommend having taken a biology class or two (SCRB 10 was super helpful) just so you can follow easily in lecture. I'd say whereas SCRB 10 had a focus on being creative and thinking big, this course encourages you to think very practically. This aspect is reflected in the psets and final project where the teaching team isn't afraid to push back if they think experiments you propose aren't realistic or feasible, so keep that in mind when doing assignments. However, it is very evident that Amie genuinely cares about what you learn and wants you to take certain things away from the course. The course overall is extremely interesting, but appropriately challenging. The psets and midterms are challenging but doable if you put in a little bit of time to study and get them done. The final project can also be a lot of writing, but they gave us feedback based on our outlines so we knew how to refine our proposals, so I'm hoping they turn out well based on that. I agree with previous years' Q guides that it's not an easy A, but definitely possible. Still waiting for grades to come out, so we'll see how those turn out.",0.9945,,0.0,"If you want to learn about how to read a scientific paper and also about leading research in aging biology, take this course! There is really not too much work – the psets are pretty short and the exams are (relatively) low stress. However just because there isn’t that much work doesn’t mean that its a gem – the PSETs are graded pretty hard. The course casts a pretty wide net and you will go through information very fast, but there is always time to focus in on something specific that you are interested in for the final project or on certain PSET questions.  The content can also be pretty hard to understand sometimes, but I feel like I’ve gotten a really good overview of the entire aging biology field.",0.9663,125185,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Stem Cell & Regenerative Biol,Stem Cell & Regenerative Biol,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,"Understanding Aging: Degeneration, Regeneration, and the Scientific Search for the Fountain of Youth"

It was easy to fit into my schedule and attend regularly, which allowed me to make the most of the class. The workload was also manageable, with only a couple of short assignments to complete in addition to the dancing.Overall, I would say that Gaga dance class is a must–take if you are in the quad area.

He's a once–in–a–lifetime kind of instructor in terms of the care he takes with the material and his ability to maneuver through discussions. The course material itself is truly diverse in its list of theorists, and it offered some truly radical arguments about what queer theory looks like and what it can do. I learned how to really think through gender in a high–level, theoretical way without ever losing sight of the importance of lived experience and the need for change. The assignments very subtly builds to a more involved final project (I chose to do a 10–15 page paper, but you have total creative freedom on what the project could look like) – I never felt like I was being hand–held, but I also never though an assignment was out of my reach, even though I started and ended on two different planes of capacity. Tommy offers incredible feedback and truly cares about our successes. I can definitely see how this class could suck if it was in different hands, so if you're lucky enough to have Tommy, take advantage of it.",0.9912,,0.0,,0.0,156043,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,"Women, Gender & Sexuality","Women, Gender & Sexuality",,Social Sciences,,Seminar,Queer Theory
