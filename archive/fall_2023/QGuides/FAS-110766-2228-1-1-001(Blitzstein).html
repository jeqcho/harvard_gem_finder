You gain valuable background skills in statistics and intuition about probability that are useful in many STEM fields. Some pieces of advice: 1) you will get bad grades in this class, but that&#x27;s okay because so does everyone. 2) Shop section! Find a TF that actually knows what they&#x27;re doing. Skylar and Matt are great. 3.) Find a group of friends to pset with! This lightens the load on everyone, and makes it more enjoyable.</td>

The class starts nice and slow, and everyone enjoys the introduced material and the textbook (which is in fair very good), but closer to the end of October you literally start questioning your concentration and your existence in general. Joe throws the new distributions at you with the speed of light, and you cover nearly 2 textbook chapters in a week. Yes, you might think that the class is being antagonized for no reason, but believe me, no. Since stat110 is a prereq for essentially all stem concentrations, there are so many students coming with a strong background in statistics that you might just start feeling miserable about your skills and abilities. But don&#x27;t let others change your concentration! This might be one of the hardest classes you take here, so just prepare yourself for grinding through it. <br/><br/>Tips from someone who hadn&#x27;t heard of stats before coming to 110:<br/>1. Start the psets early and don&#x27;t drop the Markov chain pset!!<br/>2. Go to section, try multiple, and find the right one for yourself!<br/>3. Solve practice problems for exams, but if you don&#x27;t have time, just read through the solutions and write down the summary of the answers of the problems you have issues with (it is often harder to start a problem than solve it, so help yourself with writing down the beginning of the solution on your cheat sheet).<br/>4. Don&#x27;t compare yourself to others! There are a lot of people who know more than you but even more of those who struggle even more.<br/>5. You are brilliant, you deserve to be here, and you deserve your STEM concentration. Never forget about it! Good luck!</td>

One thing to note is that STAT110 is a PROBABILITY course, not a statistics course. This doesn&#x27;t mean its bad, but it does mean you will learn more about how to think about problems rather than finding things out from them.<br/>Out of the intro courses I&#x27;ve taken so far at the college, this was by far the toughest, just as it can feel a bit counterintuitive when you start. The midterm comes at you quick and often leads to a very spread grade distribution; sometimes assignments can kick you down and leave you wondering how you can even approach some of these problems.<br/><br/>Definitely go to OH, and more importantly, go to lecture!!! It&#x27;s optional, but the lectures help understand the &quot;stories&quot; behind much of what is discussed, and understanding the stories is very important when you have to come up with some mathematical proof but do not remember the tools for it (trust me, it happens more than it does not)</td>

This class is no cakewalk, even if you&#x27;re pretty strong quantitatively. The ideas can be confusing and unintuitive, and it&#x27;s important that you spend enough time working with the material. I had to spend much more time than I thought I&#x27;d have to on the class. Also, I would say that this class is structured pretty well, but there&#x27;s nothing particularly amazing about the class.

I loved especially the first half of the course where a lot of creative problem solving, conditioning, etc. is necessary to arrive at the correct answer. Blitzstein is a great lecturer and generates enthusiasm for the concepts covered while also helping students understand the course material in detail. The examples he gives are helpful, although many of them can already be found in the textbook if you decide to read ahead. However, the second half of the course can be more bland as it seems to be more about simply integrating PDFs rather than creative problem solving, but some parts of it can still be fun. Many of the problem set problems can be very fun and rewarding to solve, and I definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants a closer look at probability.</td>

Grades haven&#x27;t been released yet, but through the semester the grading has been very fair and reasonable. The course content really builds on itself through the semester, and it&#x27;s easy to fall behind and then be scrambling to catch up, so go to lecture if you can or be consistent about watching the videos! It&#x27;s easy to feel like you&#x27;re on top of things because OH will help you get through the psets, but your concepts need to be very clear for the exams &ndash;&ndash; the midterm was a reality check for a lot of people. I&#x27;d also recommend shopping around sections until you find one that you like.

Several times throughout the semester, my friends turned in some assignments with actual blanks where they just did not do the question and received 100% on the homework. There were also several times when points were taken away on our homework assignments for seemingly non&ndash;important reasons. Sometimes I would go to office hours, have a TF tell my that my answer was perfect, and then get several points off because a different TF disagreed. This might seem small, but the same thing happened for tests. I compared my grade with some of my friends and if the TF that graded my test was as generous on my test as they were on my friends, I would have actually gotten a very different letter grade in this class. At that point, its really not worth bragging that your class is the biggest class at Harvard or that you have some large number of TFs. Standardize your grading. I would rather get a fair grade on my assignment than my test back the next day. Literally just create a rubric or something instead of letting your TFs go rogue on giving points or taking them away its not that hard.</td>

The textbook is open online, so you can take a look at it before the class if you want, and the textbook is incredibly detailed and readable. I relied entirely on the textbook and psets to learn and it was a really enjoyable learning experience, filled with counterintuitive yet straightforward concepts. You get exposed to probability, expectation and variance, indicator random variables, discrete and continuous probability distributions, Markov chains, etc. The class is paced very reasonably, with tons of helpful support resources and great sections. You get provided a cheat sheet and like 10 practice midterms and finals so this class really sets you up for success.</td>

It&#x27;s a HARD class but it&#x27;s a fascinating class in terms of subject matter and it sets you up very well to learn actual proper statistics and probability (gets easier after stat 111). If you take this class, know that you should start the psets early and you should do AS MUCH PRACTICE as possible before the midterm and final.

It&#x27;s not the same as AP Stat (in fact way, way, way far away from it) in that it teaches probability, so keep that in mind if you&#x27;re looking to learn statistics for data science. It&#x27;s hard. Did I say it&#x27;s hard? It&#x27;s really hard. But rewarding. Joe is a fantastic lecturer, and I think it honestly should be a gold standard in terms of how classes should be organized. 9&ndash;12 AM office hours and sections every day, Joe (or another person in the class) explains every single post on Ed at lightning speed, the 3 hour midterm&#x2F;final reviews that TFs hold; it&#x27;s really fantastic! <br/><br/>Three things:<br/>1. For the love of God don&#x27;t do what I did; please read the textbook early. Do the problems in them. The problems are hard when you begin, but you&#x27;ll thank yourself when midterms and finals roll around and you can actually solve the problems in the practice exams. Think the textbook is insurmountable when you&#x27;re trying to read it to get those PSETS in? It&#x27;s ~expo(nentially) worse when you try to cram 7 chapters in 2 days. <br/>2. Speaking of practice exams, for midterms and finals, do. all. the practice. exams. Please. They&#x27;ll be your saving grace. Somehow Joe writes a new midterm and final every year, so he releases all the old midterms from the previous year all the way back to the dinosaur ages. They&#x27;re so helpful, and there are patterns that repeat themselves. Do them (and not with the answer key in front of you so you gaslight yourself into feeling like you know the answer and that you could get the answer on an exam. Nothing more frustrating than knowing you saw the literal exact problem structure and looked at the answer key, but actually don&#x27;t know how to solve it. It&#x27;s devastating.) <br/>3. Go to the 200 office hours that are available! And go to section. I know it&#x27;s hard because it&#x27;s not assigned, but the TFs are absolutely fantastic. And they&#x27;ll make figuring out the PSET way faster.<br/><br/>This class can be a monster at times, but it&#x27;s worth it. Somehow by the end, it transforms half of the class into stat concentrators, so take that as you will. Good luck soldier may Joe bless you with intuition and a lot of time to study for this class.</td>

I really enjoyed thinking through the problem sets (and even doing practice problems to study for exams!), but often it was difficult to make progress on questions, as the material is hard to grasp and often unintuitive.  With lots of practice, I was more comfortable with approaching and solving problems.  I highly recommend spending a lot of time working through the material, making sure you think through why the strategies you employed on the problem sets and the answers to questions make sense, and make sure to read the textbook!  The textbook is a very valuable resource for getting a better grasp on material, as it provides very thorough explanations, with emphasis on what strategies to use and patterns to recognize, as well as plenty of worked&ndash;out examples.

Also think twice about simultaneously enrolling. Its hard doing Math&#x2F;CS in general because every class that you want to take together seems to be at the same time as required courses (for example, this semester, all of the undergrad algebra courses were at the same time as stat 110).

The midterm was brutal and made me begin to take this class more seriously. Honestly, if I&#x27;d taken it seriously from the start, I&#x27;d probably have gotten a better grade. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did. You&#x27;re probably tired of reading this but READ THE TEXTBOOK. Don&#x27;t get tired of reading the textbook. Studying for the final helped me to begin to realize the significance and intricacies of a lot of concepts, and even though I flunked the final (relative to how hard I studied for it), I&#x27;m more motivated than ever to take more stats courses even though I don&#x27;t need to, because STAT 110 felt like a really interesting intro to a story that has much more to it (will update you on how STAT 111 goes). So, if you&#x27;re remotely interested in theoretical statistics, are solidly comfortable with calculus (I cannot emphasize this point enough), and are willing to work hard (perhaps the most important prerequisite), take this class regardless of your concentration.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS UNTIL THEY CHANGE IT.<br/><br/>TL;DR: The material is interesting, but the execution of the class is so bad you could literally read the textbook and not do anything else and gain about the same amount of information on probability as you would otherwise. Joe&#x27;s lovely though.<br/><br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>Blitzstein&#x27;s a good lecturer, he&#x27;s funny, likes to joke with the class, and very human. Very generous extension, drop, and grading policy, and he does have his heart in the right place. The material is also interesting and has many connections (too bad literally none of them are explored lmao).<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>This course wants to be an intro course while teaching material that is not intro&ndash;level, and definitely not at an intro&ndash;level pace. Do not listen to the requirements, if you don&#x27;t have multivariable calculus or some notion of linear algebra you will not be able to fully understand and appreciate the material, especially in the latter half of the semester, where it&#x27;s all calculus and Markov chains are entirely linear algebra. It also sits at a crossroads between rigorous and unrigorous maths; proofs are required in PSETS and exams but it is never explained how one should get to such proofs, some results are entirely opaque and not even the TFs understand them, and story proofs have a special place in hell. <br/><br/>The textbook is terrible and proof&ndash;laden, which is incredibly counterproductive and does not serve students. Practice problems are useless since you don&#x27;t have the solutions to them. All the material pre&ndash;midterm does not require actual logic but rather rote memorization of the examples in lecture and the textbook, which artificially deflates grades and makes the course a lot harder than it needs to be. <br/><br/>The midterm is not useful in any way for a thorough understanding of the material and relies solely on being lucky about what topics are drawn. The class is also completely different pre&ndash; and post&ndash;midterm in terms of intensity and PSET difficulty, messing up students&#x27; plans and greatly increasing the amount of time needed. For evidence of this, look to 80% of the TFs, whom all say they did terribly on the midterm and then great on the final. Also, a standard deviation of over 20 points is insane.<br/><br/>Lectures are useless. Blitzstein is a good lecturer and can get his points across, but there&#x27;s no point in going if everything he says is on the textbook anyway, literally word&ndash;for&ndash;word the same. <br/><br/>PSETS have little to do with what is actually being taught that week and are always a weird mix, especially post&ndash;midterm, of stuff you did the week prior and stuff you&#x27;re covering the week of the PSET. They also vary wildly in terms of time commitment, with in most recent memory, PSETs 9  and 10 being day and night, respectively.<br/><br/>The course is structured such that there is no natural connection between topics even though there can definitely be one, which makes the material uselessly frustrating to wrap one&#x27;s head around.<br/><br/>Section is not useful in the slightest, and there is so little publicity for it anyway that one can go the entire course without going and it would not make a difference. Office Hours also suffer from the same issues, with TFs not being much help and the bulk of the benefit of OHs being finding a PSET group, because even though this class is 800 people you might as well be the only one taking it due to the lack of communication between students.</td>

This is one of the hardest intro to stats courses you can take at Harvard if you are coming in with limited background or experience. The psets are definitely doable, but have taken on average 3 office hours to get through (especially with the sheer number of people attending OH), and the material is hard to comprehend without taking time to sit down and grapple with it on your own. This course focuses a lot on application, rather than regurgitating information or blindly using equations and formulas. The content is super interesting, but know what you&#x27;re getting into in terms of difficulty and time commitment (esp in comparison to the rest of your courses that semester).</td>

Do not let your grades in this class force you to reevaluate your ability to do math or make you feel like you learned nothing. I certainly felt that way.

The amount of resources available to you are overwhelming. Exams were really hard. My complaint about the psets are that they were pretty variable in length, but averaged on so long that by the end I had stopped caring about knowing or understanding. I just wanted to get it done and took no pride or satisfaction in completing it because it had made me behind on other things. Certain office hours pretty much just walked you through the answers and I learned that my schedule did not permit me to attend those blessed meetings.<br/><br/>Lectures were kind of bad: they focused on derivations that you didn&#x27;t really need to use and formulas that you could just as easily have in your notes from spending 15 minutes in the chapter summaries of the textbook. <br/><br/>Get in the habit of reading the textbook on weekends and doing a few of the strategic practice problems.

There is a section component, but that is purely optional (and I don&#x27;t know anyone who went to those, as opposed to the office hours). If you feel comfortable enough in the material it isn&#x27;t necessary to attend everything, but if you are struggling you have to hold yourself accountable and actually start showing up in the lecture.<br/><br/>This year was the biggest Stat 110 has ever been, and midterm average grades were unusually low. What that misses is that there were two spikes, one among the low grades and one among the high &ndash; it is so easy to slip in Stat 110, so make sure you are always on top of everything. The class starts very slowly, but it soon (especially after the midterm), picks up pretty quickly. Don&#x27;t get left behind!</td>

However, as someone with a pretty average mathematical background like myself, this class is very very very difficult. At times I felt completely lost with the material, and no matter how much work I put in, I still performed very poorly on both exams in the class.  I do not want to deter anyone from taking the class because when you do understand the material, it is very rewarding and interesting. However, just be prepared for the amount of work you are going to have to put in. I also want to add that there is a lot of support available in this class. There are over 80 TF&#x27;s who all want to help you succeed, so go to office hours, go to section, just go to everything you can. It is so helpful.</td>

It is manageable and interesting, but you MUST put in the time to read the textbook and to do as many practice problems as possible from the start. Looking back, I should&#x27;ve been spending at least 20 hours a week on the course to understand from the beginning, as not understanding the beginning weeks makes the later weeks far harder. This class is wonderful, as long as you give it the necessary time&ndash;dedication it requires! The professor is super passionate, and all of the TFs are incredibly kind and willing to help!</td>

My advice is to go to section (if Cat and Skyler are still TFs, go to theirs!!) and when you study, just review the section notes (again, Cat and Skyler&#x27;s notes if they are still TFs) because section is definitely comprehensive enough without the extraneous information in the textbook. I just studied the section notes and did a few of the practice tests (definitely do as many practice exams as time allows) and did pretty well on both the midterm and final, so I can vouch for this studying method. Do not try psets on your own. You should, of course, try the questions on your own first, but don&#x27;t get bogged down on any one question to save time during the week. Go to office hours (this goes without saying). Don&#x27;t be discouraged by your grade on the midterm. Joe is a reasonable man and allows you to weight your final higher if you do better on the final, which most people do. Good luck in the course!</td>

Joe’s clear lectures, plenty of office hours, and extensive course materials&#x2F;student support will set you up for success in tackling the difficult concepts you’ll encounter in Stat 110.<br/>The hard prerequisite for this course is definitely Math 1b, because you’ll be taking a lot of integrals in the second half of the course. The first half of the course is more discrete math&ndash;style. One disclaimer: the counting unit in the very beginning of the course is very difficult, and there will be a very steep learning curve unless you’ve learned counting before in competition math, high school, etc. So, even if you find the course very challenging in the beginning, it’s completely alright––once you grasp the first few weeks of content, the math becomes a little friendlier. You might find it helpful to review&#x2F;preview some counting, if you have time over the summer. <br/>One of my favorite parts about this course has been the extensive student support––there are office hours almost every hour of the week, and you get a lot of practice exams (we got TEN for the midterm, and TWELVE for the final. It will prepare you well!) The course tries its best to set you up for success; take advantage of this! Even if you’re taking this course as a CS concentrator knocking out your probability requirement or something (that’s me), you will learn a lot of interesting, powerful, and worthwhile facts in this course––and given that this class has 700 students, there’s a pretty high probability you’ll have some friends to pset with :)</td>

If you do, then there&#x27;s not much else you can do. I say read the textbook from the very beginning of the course, and if there&#x27;s anything you don&#x27;t get, immediately try to understand it instead of waiting weeks later when you&#x27;re studying for an exam because you will regret it. If you don&#x27;t need to take this class, and there&#x27;s some other class that fulfills the same requirement, do some very deep contemplation and ask around and see if maybe that other course might be a better option.</td>
