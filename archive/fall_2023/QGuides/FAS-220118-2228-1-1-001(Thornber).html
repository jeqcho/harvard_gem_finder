While it could have a few improvements, generally this course was decent. However, this class was advertised as &quot;Mental Health in Arts and Literature,&quot; but there was almost NO art involved, which was SUCH a missed opportunity given that the classroom was literally inside the Harvard Art Museum. I was promised a museum tour and did not end up receiving one, and as someone very interested in art history and was greatly looking forward to exploring how mental health is explored through art, I was very disappointed in that regard. The readings were interesting but VERY long, although they did shorten it after the midterm feedback, which was nice. Overall the class isn&#x27;t too bad and you do learn a lot especially if you&#x27;re interested in mental health and psychiatry. It also fulfills the premed writing requirement if that&#x27;s something you&#x27;re interested in.</td>

If you are someone who is very interested in mental health and is okay with reading one to two books a week, this course will give you a lot of insight into the patients&#x27; views of mental illness and you will learn a lot. However, the course is very time consuming for a GENED, so be careful with your decisions if you are not enthusiastic about mental health. Grades are also not particularly high overall.

Assignments are relatively open ended, especially the final project &ndash;&ndash; this can be a bit intimidating, but I think it also provides an enjoyable balance to courses with lots of problem sets and written finals.

How much you enjoy this course may depend on your TF, because some TFs (like Yang Qu, who was my TF) are awesome and approachable, while other TFs are trifling and strict for no reason whatsoever. Also, I know this is a Gened, but please show Prof. Thornber at least a basic level of respect and seriousness. It was obvious that many students in this class were pre&ndash;meds who didn&#x27;t show up to lecture and didn&#x27;t put in an ounce of effort into anything unless their grade depended on it, and honestly I felt bad for Thornber. Don&#x27;t be that student. I wasn&#x27;t exactly ecstatic to be taking this course either, but in the end the course materials were still engaging&#x2F;rewarding. As long as you show up to class and skim the readings at least, you&#x27;ll have an enjoyable time.</td>

The texts selected, despite some being irrelevant to the course, were still very interesting, and I am sure will become more germane as time goes on. The class itself is simply interesting and allows one to explore mental illness and health through a frame other than science.</td>

The readings are interesting and close reading is only important if you have an assignment based off that reading. The themes of the course are engaging and very straightforward if you have any psych background. Even if you don&#x27;t, it is still easy to do well in this course.</td>

The subject matter is so, so important and gave me a much deeper understanding of the cultural context around mental health and mental illness. Professor Thornber is so kind and understanding, and during each lecture, she provided a thoughtful breakdown of each of our readings in addition to some historical and cultural context. The blog posts were straightforward and quite informal, and the short paper&#x2F;final capstone project weren&#x27;t too bad. Overall, the course staff including Professor Thornber are very understanding and accommodating and I felt like the course was set up to actually help us think critically and grow as learners and members of society.</td>

You learn a lot about how different mental illnesses can impact individuals differently based on cultural beliefs, values, and associated stigma. You also learn a bit of history associated with these cultures and about the different health care systems in place in different communities. The texts are really interesting, and section is great. The lectures are a bit dry, but are helpful in getting an understanding about the relevant themes in the texts. Overall not too much work, and interesting topics!</td>

Although I took the class to satisfy the pre&ndash;med English req (writing the analytical paper as opposed to capstone group project was a bit more stressful&#x2F;difficult),  I highly recommend. Fair warning, there is a lot of reading from time to time but it is very manageable since you write blog posts every other week and have some wiggle room for catching up. Take this if you’re willing to show up to lecture and engage with the topic :)</td>

I cannot really tell you the big picture&#x2F;broad overarching themes of this course. I feel like the plot was not clear and never became clear; the course material focused on mental illness representations across the globe and was reading&ndash;heavy but the discussion was never centered around the arts as a whole. We only read memoirs and looked at paintings once or twice during a presentation from the Harvard Art Museums. Beyond that, the course was just a regurgitation of &quot;those who are mentally ill struggle&quot; and &quot;mental health stigma is bad&quot; every week. Professor is receptive to feedback; we expressed that the readings were too much and she trimmed it down. However, when we said the course was not engaging, she decided to throw more busy work at us with polls and random useless response questions on Canvas. This was a drag and did not add anything special to the class. By not engaging, we meant that the course material she discussed at length was boring. Once again, just repetition. No unique focus on art styles or psychology or social constructions of stigma&#x2F;bias. Just surface level engagement discussing the very nuanced topic of mental health&#x2F;illness. The grading breakdown is generous and you can definitely pass but it will feel like a drag sometimes due to the busy work. Harsh or lenient grading depends on your TF.  Teaching staff was useless, no offense. Did not particularly enjoy section with my TF Lizzie. Overall the class was decent but not change&ndash;your&ndash;life worthy.</td>

Take this class if you&#x27;re not afraid of reading maybe 100&ndash;150 pages each week.</td>

It was the first time this course was offered so there were some bumps in the road but the teaching staff quickly adapted so the second half of the course ran really well, be prepared to read around 100 pgs per class, but the reading is novels and memoirs so its very interesting and is not to difficult to do.  Section and assignments are pretty chill just do it to the best of your ability and chances are you&#x27;ll get a good grade.</td>

I do have to say that the readings can be long and sometimes extensive, but they are rewarding in the end. One suggestion is to not leave the readings off because the midterm quiz will be really challenging if you left off all the readings till the last minute. The midterm quiz was a pain and that is the worst part of the course. However, the final and the first paper was reasonable.</td>
