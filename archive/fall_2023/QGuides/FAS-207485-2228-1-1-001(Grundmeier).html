However, you can certainly do well in this class, and an A is definitely attainable if you put in some solid work, show up to class, and do not bs your way through the WeB work (this 100% hurts you when the exam comes). Do not wait until Tuesday to start your problem sets–you will be in for some brutal Tuesday nights&#x2F;Wednesday mornings. Go to the TF office hours (the Tuesday night one was $). Also, the problem sessions are highly underrated. Very few people show up to them, so this means you get a lot of interaction with the TFs. In my experience, the problem session was just another office hours (even though Dusty said you would get extra more “exam&ndash;like” problems). There are four midterms in the class (which definitely does feel like a lot), but there is no final (only a final project). There are also no sections. Also, the class is meant to be collaborative. You should definitely work with classmates. Always make sure to give it a shot on your own &amp; ensure you understand all of the proofs, but there is also a part of this class where you are meant to work and figure out solutions together. You should be able to get 100% on the problem sets if you are checking with classmates (and do the extra credit). Lastly, this class is theoretical. It is less computational than the other course options below it (though we still do learn the computational aspects), which is something to keep in mind during course selection and your concentration goals.</td>

I am a freshman most likely concentrating in applied math cs and I felt like going into this year I got very little guidance on what to take. There are so many options! I took this class somewhat on a whim and I think it was the best choice by far. Here are my thoughts:<br/><br/>18&#x2F;19 seem like a lot of fun but they are very specific to their subject areas. In addition, not that many people are in them. Take it you are very passionate about those areas but not otherwise. <br/><br/>21 seems fun and a lot of people do it. That said, it’s a lot of computation and busy work since there are no proofs and 3 psets a week. They have to work on a pset pretty much every night (so it’s the same if not more of a time commitment than 22) but it’s a lot less rewarding (more plug and chug). You will also end up having to take an additional class (120 i think) to learn proofs anyway. <br/><br/>I literally don’t know a single person who did applied math 22 it doesn’t seem to be very popular. <br/><br/>25 seems incredible but it’s A LOT of work. There is a reason there are 200 people who take 22 but only 40 who take 25. Most of my friends who tried out both classes in the beginning of the year dropped down to 22. It seems like the teacher is amazing and you get an incredible grasp of math on both a granular and broad level but it is going to be very hard and very time consuming. Only do it if you are really serious about pursuing math. In that case it will be very rewarding. <br/><br/>Now for the reasons 22 is amazing!! First off, based on the comments on this page you have probably already heard that Dusty is amazing. He makes an effort to know everyone’s name. He is a very passionate lecturer. And he seems to overall really care for his student’s individually (which is really hard to find in other intro lecture classes). For example, he encourages you to email him or meet with him with any questions. If people do badly on an exam he offers corrections. There were even times during really stressful weeks where he offered pset extensions to the whole class. In addition, the community is great. Because it’s a pset class you will have to find people to work with which encourages you to make friends (and with 200 people there are a lot of opportunities to do so!). Somehow, when people discuss the class they assume that you know everyone in it (and that is pretty much true). GO TO OFFICE HOURS! Psets take a while by yourself but are easier and more fun with friends. In addition it’s a great way to meet people and find people to sit with. I would sometimes go to office hours by myself and just ask if anyone was working on a specific problem and join them. This is actually how I have found some of my best friends (even out of the class). Finally, the material is really fun. Proofs allow you to be creative and you walk away with a final project that you can be really proud of. The class overall is obviously challenging but as someone who hasn’t done linear or multi before I felt that it was doable!</td>

As someone who never really took the hardest math class available to them in high school, this is a class that might be a good fit if you are ready to challenge yourself without overloading yourself. I believe that most people who are up to the challenge should take this class solely because of the proof knowledge that it provides you with which is crucial for computer science and theoretical math. However, this class is sometimes hard. You cannot just get by by just memorizing the concepts, you have to have an understanding of them and how they are derived. Studying for our 4 midterms was not easy because you had to move past computation and try to understand the concepts behind the computation. Proofs were something you could not really truly prepare yourself for which was sometimes stressful.

However, the course also had some issues, particularly in the gap in difficulty between the lectures and the problem sets. The course consisted of three lectures per week that reference material from two textbooks. Dusty assigned a chapter or two of reading per lecture, but these often felt unnecessary, since the lectures covered the same material. There was no section for the course. Problem sets were due weekly, and they consisted of a computational portion and a proof&ndash;based portion. Dusty is a very good lecturer, and I often came out of lecture feeling like I entirely understood the material. However, the problem sets felt very difficult relative to the lecture material. Be prepared to attend office hours regularly and collaborate on problem sets. Thankfully, Dusty is very easily accessible via email and eager to help students. He also created a nice community around the class, and I met many of my closest friends through this course. There were four midterms throughout the semester, which felt unrelenting at times, but the ability to submit corrections for our mistakes for half&ndash;credit was very generous and an excellent learning opportunity. There was no final exam, but instead there was a final group project paper to explore a topic of interest from a linear algebra perspective. I really enjoyed this format, and although it probably took just as long as studying for an exam, I preferred working on a topic of my own choosing. Having been a strong math student in high school, I was not expecting to struggle as much as I did in this course. It is not overly difficult, but I would advise interested students not to write this course off as a walk in the park by any means. Overall, Dusty did a nice job preparing students for continuing in pure math, applied math, or another subject area that uses proof&ndash;based linear algebra. If you want an extremely rigorous introduction to proof&ndash;based math, or if you are mostly interested in computation, you may consider a different math course. However, if you don’t want to devote 20+ hours per week on math and want to cover both proof&ndash;based and computational methods, this is the right course for you.</td>

A great linear algebra class that takes itself seriously but not to the extent of 25 or 55, and does not assume you&#x27;ve already taken linear algebra or proof&ndash;based classes like those two. Definitely allows you to do other stuff during the semester (i.e. I took Stat 110, EXPOS 20, and a hard GenEd and was perfectly fine) provided you understand the material well enough, and office hours and Dusty&#x27;s own availability makes it such that even if you don&#x27;t, you can get comfortable quickly. <br/><br/>The material is rigorous, thorough, and leaves you with concrete knowledge of the subject and proof&ndash;writing techniques that you wouldn&#x27;t get anywhere else with this level of commitment. Also allows you to skip CS20 if you&#x27;re thinking of doing CS, which is always nice. <br/><br/>There is no final, with students having to produce a final project instead, which is a great, low&ndash;stress way of deepening the understanding of the material while learning new applications for it that we might use in future classes. <br/><br/>Dusty is definitely the highlight. He is a deeply caring, kind, understanding person and an even better lecturer, and loves to joke with the class while also respecting us and setting appropriate levels of time commitment and difficulty for the homeworks and exams. I cannot stress this enough, take this class take this class take this class!!!!<br/><br/>The only complaint I have is about the time it takes to get Psets back, but that&#x27;s one of the class&#x27;s growing pains and will definitely be fixed by 2023 as the department hires more TFs.</td>

Some advice&#x2F; reservations:<br/>&ndash; You&#x27;re likely to enjoy this class more if it&#x27;s your first math class at Harvard. If it&#x27;s not, adjusting from the way other courses (e.g 1A, 1B, 21A) are taught may be a little challenging yet will be really key in your success in this course. <br/>&ndash; Dusty is a good professor and there&#x27;s a fair amount of opportunities to connect with him. Don&#x27;t fail to take advantage of this. <br/>&ndash; Have a problem set group. The proofs aren&#x27;t always hard but can get a little gnarly, especially when the class gets into abstract vector spaces. <br/>&ndash; Practice material for midterms isn&#x27;t necessarily sufficient. Sometimes you have to scour the textbook&#x2F; Internet for extra problems, which isn&#x27;t ideal. <br/><br/>So, based on what I heard about 21B, this class sounds a fair bit better, but perhaps not for everyone. In any case, if you&#x27;ve never learnt math in a lecture format before, beware. Good luck!</td>

I came into this class with BC calc from high school as my math background, but the approach to linear algebra starts from the ground up and you get great practice with proof writing strategies. This was my toughest class this semester, but undoubtedly the most rewarding. 22A definitely shaped my perspective on math: there&#x27;s pretty much no emphasis on memorization, and much more emphasis on understanding WHY certain facts are the way they are, and applying the concepts and theorems you learn to new situations via proofs. Also, for any incoming freshmen looking at this, 22A is a great way to calibrate your expectations on what a Harvard exam might feel like, and what a successful Harvard course might feel like.<br/><br/>Dusty and the TFs are awesome&ndash;&ndash;you will need to go to office hours, and be prepared to build your semester around 22A if you don&#x27;t have a strong linear algebra background (my commitment was around 6&ndash;8 hours a week).

Having taken a different linear algebra class, I can say that his explanations are sometimes convoluted and confusing. It&#x27;s also hard to get extra support in the class since TFs are busy and many students have questions on PSETS. Also, many of the students in the class just care about the grade not the learning. Don&#x27;t fall for the hype around Dusty and this class. Dusty is a great person, and he&#x27;ll probably give you a good grade, but the reality is that you won&#x27;t learn that much about linear algebra.
