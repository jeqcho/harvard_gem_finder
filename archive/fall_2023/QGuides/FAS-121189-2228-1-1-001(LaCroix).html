They want exact answers that hit off all the key info, and if not you will get points off. The main thing that I regret is that I didn&#x27;t go to OH sooner.  Also, lecture is uninteresting. Try your best not to fall behind on material!! Some people prefer to just watch the learning pod videos instead of doing that and reading the textbook.<br/><br/>Most people have to take this class freshman year fall because it&#x27;s a requirement, so it&#x27;s just one of those things you have to do.</td>

However, by starting on assignments early, practicing&#x2F;reviewing information well before PIES&#x2F;midterms, and GOING TO OFFICE HOURS, you can definitely get through everything. Notice the emphasis on office hours! Chris&#x27; office hours on Sundays and how he guided us through pset questions were sooo helpful! But honestly any of the office hours can be very helpful; the important thing is to go to them because it&#x27;s totally normal for psets and lab assignments to be challenging! Also, going to the tutoring offered by the ARC is also really helpful if you want one&ndash;on&ndash;one help. I would definitely recommend you to try assignments on your own first before getting help, though, just to evaluate how much you know and understand. Overall, receiving my first PIE and midterm grades (which weren&#x27;t so pretty) pushed me to become a better student and manage my time better, which helped me improve in the course. So don&#x27;t be discouraged if it takes you time to adjust to everything. Be patient with yourself and just try your best! Good luck :)</td>

I would highly recommend taking notes while watching the learning pods and just paying close attention during the learning pods. The first couple of learning pods seem redundant and not that useful, but as the semester progresses those learning pods are GOLD and are very helpful for exam review. Also, GO TO OFFICE HOURS!!! The professors hold multiple office hours, but my favorite ones were with Rebecca and Sien. They are absolutely fantastic and great at explaining concepts. Get to know the professors&ndash;&ndash;they genuinely care about you and want you to succeed.

LS1a was incredibly difficult for me since I have almost no background in chemistry or biology, but taking the class ended up being one of the most transformative experiences of my life and was a gratifying experience in the end. On my first midterm, I got 70% of the questions correct, and it almost broke me. I had done well on all the problem sets leading up to the midterm, and I felt good about my responses on the midterm. However, after receiving the results from midterm 1, I realized that even though I understood the problem set questions on a superficial level, I did not understand them well enough to apply my knowledge if questions were asked differently. This made me understand how important it is to take LS1a very seriously because biochemistry is no joke, and that solving as many problems as possible along with thorough reading and discussion with peers, teaching fellows, and instructors to try to get an intuitive understanding of the concepts was my best chance to get a positive experience with the class. And it worked. I got a 98% on my second midterm, and even though I have not received my final grade yet, I feel that it was way better than my first midterm, even though I know I got some things wrong. But most importantly, I left Cambridge after the LS1a final, feeling incredibly proud of everything I have learned from taking LS1a this semester, from intermolecular interactions to DNA transcription and translation to membrane transport and how they can be connected. I strongly recommend taking LS1a, but unless you have a solid background in chemistry and biology, beware of the challenge. Good luck!</td>

There are weeks that feel really overwhelming as you have psets and learning pods due Monday, a lab due Wednesday, and then a PIE assessment on Thursday. Furthermore, the week after your midterm will be another PIE, which I feel is formatted strangely as the material on the Midterm is not on the PIE, so you have to revisit past content for the midterm and then review new content for the PIE immediately after. Lectures are quite boring and tedious. The material exposed in class is pretty much reflective of the learning pods that you are required to watch for homework, so lecture really did feel like a waste of time. I would make use of SSN!

It is very hard to put into words how much I hated this class. I came into this course with a very strong background in biology and chemistry and a passion for life science, but this course completely turned me away from ever taking another science class again. <br/><br/>Here is what makes this class just so bad. <br/><br/>Lectures: On the first day of class, the preceptors and professors introduced the “reverse classroom” approach, which soon became an excuse for not teaching. Most of the lectures consisted of the preceptors or professors just asking questions, rather than explaining the scientific concepts. At the start, this approach was ok because the material was easy, but as the concepts became harder, the lectures became a waste of time because  I skipped most of the lectures and still got very high scores on the assignments and midterms. <br/><br/>Homework: This may be the worst part of the class. Each week, the problem set just becomes a challenge to see how long it will take for a TF to give you the answers at office hours. Most of the problems can’t be answered completely correctly using the textbook and the learning pod videos, so you have to go to office hours if you want to do well. Additionally, YOUR ANSWERS HAVE TO MATCH THE ANSWER KEY ALMOST EXACTLY TO GET CREDIT. This was incredibly frustrating during the semester because you can understand everything and have an almost perfect explanation written, but then have to rewrite the answer entirely because the answer key uses a couple of different words. My advice is to find TFs that basically read the answer key to you and go to SSN because some of the fellow students will just show you the answer key. Also, always check why you lost points on the PSETS because often it is just a grading error that you should not lose points for. Utilize regrades. <br/><br/>Tests and PIES: The assessment method in this course is just ridiculous. In fall 2022, there were 6 quizzes (PIEs), 2 midterms, and a final, all in 12 weeks. It gets to the point where there are no new concepts to even assess, so the preceptors just create PIE questions that focus on the most obscure details. My advice is don’t study for the PIEs a lot, just familiarize yourself with the textbook so you know what page to go to when the PIE is happening. The midterms also focus on tiny details, so don’t expect to do well because there will inevitably be some small things that you miss.<br/><br/>Grading: Unlike other classes, which reward you for understanding, this course just rewards you for being better than your fellow classmates and friends. From day 1, it becomes a competition for who can get an A because only the top 15% or so get one, even if that means you need a 96 or 97 to qualify. On problem sets, I repeatedly found myself asking myself if I should help others or if doing so would penalize me in the end. <br/><br/>The one redeeming factor of LS1a is the friends that you will make. But, this is not enough of a reason to take this class. I highly recommend TAKING LPSA INSTEAD. LPSA is actually taught. The structure of the class is also much better and the grading is more forgiving. Good luck if you decide to take LS1a anyway.</td>

The problem sets are actually really helpful in strengthening understanding of the material.<br/>If you are considering LS50, I think that class is more niche&#x2F;unique and you develop a stronger relationship with professors and classmates, but it&#x27;s not as comprehensive in terms of what it actually teaches you (the material doesn&#x27;t connect&#x2F;integrate as well as it does in Ls1A).<br/><br/>One really great thing about Ls1a is the community and support offered &ndash; definitely take advantage of SSNs! The students who run them are great and super helpful</td>

And quite quickly, you&#x27;ll see that many of these people (of which you may be one) will go through an identity crisis because this is the first challenging STEM class they&#x27;ve ever taken. For those of you who aren&#x27;t premed, you either won&#x27;t care too much that your grade is bad, or you&#x27;ll slay out and get an ego boost as you watch the premeds around you crash and burn. No matter who you are, though, that&#x27;s okay. This class is a weed&ndash;out, but from an interest standpoint rather than a grade one. An A is easily achievable with sufficient effort, but you&#x27;ll quickly discover whether or not a concentration in the life sciences is for you.<br/>Advice for the class itself: the most important things are the LEARNING PODS. Lecture is nearly impossible to focus on unless you&#x27;re among the 5 kids that actually participate. For the rest of you, do your learning pods. Please. There are textbook readings and videos, and you technically have to do both but my advice is to do one REALLY well and forget about the other. In some cases, both the textbook and videos can be helpful, but I&#x27;ve found that one or the other, if done well, will suffice (I recommend the videos). Section should be good to patch any holes that you still have after the learning pods. <br/>Ah, section! This requires another paragraph altogether. Section is made or broken by which TF you get, so hope to the lord that you get a good one. The worst (cough cough Yanming) can ruin your experience, while the best (Koby, Flora, etc) can make even the non&ndash;premeds consider medicine. I would also say that having a chill TF is great in case you sleep through the occasional section; send em a quick apology and, viola! You&#x27;ve made it to class.  The final thing that TFs are AMAZING for is office hours! Please please please find a good TF (even if it isn&#x27;t your own) and attend their office hours each week with pset questions. I promise you won&#x27;t regret it.<br/>Overall, I would say that if you&#x27;re considering a concentration in the life sciences at all, take this class. The professors are extremely kind and knowledgable, and even if you end up disliking the subject matter, you learn a lot about yourself and your interests. You&#x27;ll be well on your way to clarity for your college education and potentially your career.</td>

In reality, do not do all of these methods. Never watch the learning pod videos–just answer the questions. READ THE TEXTBOOK; the textbook is only used for this class, so it has all of the content you need. Lecture can be useful sometimes (especially if you have done the reading before), but you do not need to go to every one (just hit the minimum 80% requirement for the breakout questions). Go to office hours (Monday office hours before the PSET was due worked like a charm). You should always check your answers with fellow classmates–there is no reason to not be getting above 97% average in the lab and PSET components of the course.

Dont force yourself to take this class bc you think you have to bc you absolutely do not. no one cares whether you take this or lpsa, and you&#x27;ll be doing yourself a huge favor if you arent well versed in chemistry.

If you are looking for a simple, fun elective that will introduce the sciences, this won&#x27;t be it. If you are looking for a class that pushes you very hard and you have a passion&#x2F;interest in biochemistry, then you can find enjoyment in this class. There are weekly PSETs, chapter readings, and lecture&ndash;like videos. On top of that, there are labs and online quizzes every other week, and 2 midterms and a final. So yeah, there&#x27;s a lot. However, the teaching staff is wonderful and very supportive. Dan and Sien, in particular, had awesome chemistry (pun intended) and kept lectures very interesting and engaging. Outside of lectures, you NEED to go to office hours every week. Like seriously. Do not do your PSETs or labs alone. Office hours are a wonderful way to ask TFs about important concepts, and a lot of TFs will walk you through the questions on the PSETs. You also have the opportunity to discuss problems with students in the office hours who are just as desperate for help as you. I cannot emphasize enough how much you need to go to office hours at least once a week! Find a TF that you love, make it to their office hours every week, then you have a committee of other students who come every week and a TF with whom you can form a bond and gain an advisor and letter of recommendation writer. If you are wondering about whether or not you should take LPSa or LS1a, (I believe) LPSa has a stronger emphasis on math and chemistry and then a transition to biology, whereas LS1a has an accelerated integration of chemistry and biology. Both are difficult and demanding, but the consensus that I&#x27;ve heard is that LS1a is slightly more stressful. If you&#x27;re considering taking LS50 instead of LS1a, undoubtedly take LS1a. LS50 builds a great community of freshmen, but it is an insanely competitive and demanding environment that will require that you dedicate your entire semester to science.</td>

Don&#x27;t be afraid to ask for help because there are lots of resources available that are meant to support you. Make sure to study a little after every lesson because the class is fast&ndash;paced with lots of material (often biology and chemistry combined). However, don&#x27;t worry because working with the LS1A community will build you up for success!</td>

The first section of material in this class is chemistry heavy and is very in depth. However, if you feel like you can handle it, this is definitely the best course to prepare you for LS1b and PS11 because you learn WHY things happen and not just WHAT is happening. The trick to getting basically a 100 in this class is to TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OFFICE HOURS. By asking the right questions and gaining a relationship with your TF, you can check most of your pset and lab answers.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_07e71040-ec40-4c19-abe3-26ed063b8f27">LS1A is a lot and moves quickly. It is VERY important to stay on top of your work, and if you do, you can succeed. For context, I came in mainly having done research and science competitions in high school and also did well in the class so that is the perspective from which I&#x27;m providing advice. The first half of the class is chemistry so it is a lot more chemistry than the name implies. Also, there is an emphasis on applying the material as opposed to memorizing it. Also, it&#x27;s a requirement so here&#x27;s an objective review on what you can do to succeed in the course.<br/><br/>There are a lot of moving parts to this course, so you need to stay on top of it.<br/><br/>Problem Sets &ndash; Only piece of advice is to go do Psets in Sien&#x27;s office hours or SSN. You can finish the entire thing and probably get 100% on all of the psets. Just go to Sien&#x27;s office hours or SSN and start and finish. There is no need to sit by yourself and struggle over your upset with these resources. <br/><br/>Office Hours &ndash; Go to Sien and Rebecca&#x27;s office hours. They care so much about making sure you actually know the material and your wellbeing. Going to their office hours once will help clarify everything (I mean it) that you are confused about. On weeks you have lab assignments, you can often knock out the lab assignment and Pset before the weekend.<br/><br/>Learning Pods &ndash; Read the textbook and stay ON TOP OF IT (taking notes) throughout the entire semester. I think this was the biggest differentiator between people who did relatively well and people who were stressing every time the finals rolled around. Learning pod videos are essentially a duplicate of the textbook material and so is lecture so you don&#x27;t really need to pay attention. Lectures are meant to be supplementary (not where you learn the material) and just skip through the learning pod videos to the quiz unless you are confused by something in the textbook. Then it&#x27;s nice to go back and watch the videos, but ONLY IF YOU ARE CONFUSED. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a waste of time.<br/><br/>Lectures &ndash; Lectures are often repeats of the textbook&#x2F;learning pods but sometimes its nice to pay attention when they give out Pset help. Otherwise, do something more productive during lecture.<br/><br/>PIEs &ndash; You have to learn how to take PIEs. Each question is trying to test you on a certain topic and if you can figure it out you&#x27;ll be able to do it (aka do not overthink the problems). They are lowkey stressful because they are biweekly and they can be a lot when you have two of them sandwiched with a midterm. Do the practice PIE questions and take good notes because they are open notes. Also, in the grand scheme of things, each PIE is not worth that much (2%) and you do get a drop. Make sure you are careful and take it with a calm mind.<br/><br/>Midterms &ndash; Midterms are very fair. There aren&#x27;t any curveball questions and it feels like a longer PIE. The best studying you can do is to make a good cheat sheet by reviewing the labs, problem sets, section handouts, and your notes (they don&#x27;t give practice midterms which is weird). Be aware though that they are pretty brutal with partial credit. It&#x27;s also good to make your midterm cheat sheets online so that for future midterms your life is much easier. <br/><br/>Final &ndash; They give you a practice final and I thought it was similar to the midterms in terms of fairness and what they expect you to know. Many questions are similar to the practice final.<br/><br/>Section &ndash; If you read the textbook, then section might not be the most helpful but it&#x27;s helpful to have a section leader who is good with grading because they are the ones who grade all of your assignments. Additionally, the handouts are useful because they often provide concise summaries. The most important thing with this course is to not drown in the details and section handouts help distill the core information and the broader patterns that LS1A wants you to know. It&#x27;s super important to develop a sense of what these broader patterns that they are testing you on are.<br/><br/>A dark side of LS1A is that they curve and sometimes this can mean down. In the past when there were no midterms and only open note PIEs, the cutoff for an A was between a 95 and 97 depending on who you ask. I don&#x27;t know how midterms will factor into this (overall the midterm grades helped even out the distribution and I think will help the curve) but if you want a good grade, just follow the above advice and you&#x27;ll be able to get an A. Just figure out how the course works and you will do well. Overall, I do think it is a good intro to bio and chem, it&#x27;s just a lot</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_07e71040-ec40-4c19-abe3-26ed063b8f27">There are many students who are Pre&ndash;Med and take everything extremely seriously which can be extremely exhausting. Even though it is an entry level course, be prepared for the work expected of you every week, often it was a PSet, Lab, Learning Pods and a PIE all in the same week. A background in science is extremely helpful and suggested. The Instructors were also not extremely understanding and at times the TFs also had limited understanding of some material. Office hours were also canceled often which made it difficult to get support on some assignments.</td>

The fact of the matter is Ls1a is challenging! you are not alone in your struggle, reach out! Lastly, Ls1a and LPsa both feed into Ls1b, the difference is LPSA  is structured  aid the individuals who has a weaker chemistry and biology.

Personally, I loved this course and thought it was manageable and fairly graded. It&#x27;s important to stay on top of the learning pods each week, but if you do that, you will likely not feel nervous going into exams. The PIEs (6 take home quizzes throughout the semester) force you to always be studying which can feel frustrating, but is incredibly helpful when you get to the final and realize you have already done most of the review you need. Definitely go to office hours, especially the office hours held by the course instructors&#x2F;preceptors, who are very kind and happy to help you! This class has a lot of freshman, so it is a fun way to meet other STEM majors and the staff work hard to make class exciting and helpful to new students &ndash;&ndash; there&#x27;s music at the start of class, interactive lecture components, and helpful information about getting started in research, all of which contribute to the genuine feeling that the staff are here to support you as you explore the life sciences.</td>
