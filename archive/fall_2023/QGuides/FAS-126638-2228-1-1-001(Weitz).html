The course heads and all the TFs I worked with were wonderful, but it is frustrating to feel you have a good handle on the material and to be done in by a difficult midterm. If I could do it again, I&#x27;m not sure I would have taken the class. Cooking in lab can be fun, and guest lectures could be alright, but I&#x27;m not convinced that the takeaways of the course were worth the amount of work.</td>

Some negative sides are that problem sets cannot always be solved completely with only the material covered in lectures, so we should refer to some of the optional readings. The main one &ndash;&ndash; The Supplement to the Course &ndash;&ndash;  is written in a very lengthy fashion, and too much of it is dedicated to just explaining what is about to happen later in the chapter or later in the course. So finding the needed information can take time. Also, feedback on problem sets takes a lot of time to come, which is not ideal. These things aside, I really loved the content. Perhaps the guest chefs were the best part of the course. They show such interesting things about food and always in the context of a specific culture. It was truly an eye&ndash;opening experience.

Lectures from visiting chefs are also super cool and can teach you a lot about different cuisines and history. In particular, there was one lecture by Sean  Sherman (who goes by The Sioux Chef) that stood out. He taught about the  history of American colonialism damaging Native American food culture and the concept of food decolonization.</td>

However problem sets are hard and time consuming. Also, the final project had like 4 things we needed to prepare, some of them felt like middle school assignments that we just needed to do because they were trying to find more things to require to make it a ‘real class’. However, if you’ve done high school chemistry, the content if very accessible and followable. Psets are graded harshly so if you want a strong A maybe not the class for you</td>

BUT if you&#x27;re looking for an easy and light course, this is NOT the one. Some of the lectures are very interesting and it&#x27;s fun to be cooking during lab and learning about the science behind what you&#x27;re doing, but this course does require actual physics and chemistry since it is the SCIENCE of cooking. It&#x27;s not just a cooking class where you do well if you can cook. You actually need to know the SCIENCE (chemistry, physics) of cooking. You&#x27;ll be working with equations and doing math problems during psets, so  if you&#x27;re not strong with math&#x2F;equations, this might be a little bit tedious. This course is also quite a bit of work for a GenEd, so don&#x27;t take this course if you&#x27;re looking to just relax. Unfortunately you actually have to pay attention during lectures to learn and there&#x27;s not an easy way to get through the course. The lectures don&#x27;t really have to do with the psets so be ready to do some searching on the Internet yourself on how to do some physics&#x2F;chem problems.</td>

The PSets sort of feel like busy work which I did not like, but are easy if you go to lecture. I ultimately think it is not really worth it, especially when you are taking three other time consuming courses (two sciences with psets and lab, and a beginner language that meets every day). It is not a gem, but if you feel like your schedule isn&#x27;t too packed, then it is an interesting option and I would recommend it, as the guest lectures, demonstrations, and some of the material were things that I found interesting and enjoyed. They do try to make it feel more like a true science course than I think a GenEd should be, but not bad and would still be interesting for someone not interested in science.</td>

The substantive part of the course is around as difficult, if not less so, than an advanced high school chemistry course, and the problem sets reflect that difficulty (every week it felt like we were assigned 30&ndash;60 minutes worth of busy work to complete). The labs were also uninteresting (there&#x27;s only so many times you can see how slowly a brownie solidifies) and did not really help strengthen understanding of the concepts discussed in lecture. The final project, in particular, just seemed quite silly &ndash; I&#x27;m sure some people had lots of fun with it, but for such a large portion of our grade and with such little direct connection to the course content we&#x27;ve studied throughout the semester, it honestly just felt like a very big waste of time.<br/><br/>I will note that the course staff is very engaged and have spent lots of time and energy on this course. Our TF was extremely engaging and helpful, and the boring&ndash;ness of labs was in spite of her best efforts to keep the labs interesting. The lectures, especially the guest lectures, were pretty interesting (with demonstrations!). It&#x27;s just that most other aspects of the course did not seem to be college&ndash;level at all, and consequently I felt that I wasted many hours every week on this course.</td>

I didn&#x27;t feel like the classes prepared me very well for the tests, as I thought I understood the content well and did well on the homework, but struggled on the tests.
