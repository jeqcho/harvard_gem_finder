Organic chemistry is not hard because the material is hard, it is hard because there is so much material to learn and then there are so many ways to apply it. The more familiar you are with the material, the easier it is. But it takes time. Also, study on your own and then practice in groups. It can be frustrating to work with others and see them get and understand things faster than you, so make sure that you are as solid as you personally possibly can be and then work with others to strengthen those other bits. The takeaways I cannot stress enough though is to take notes on lecture notes, write out the steps of the mechanisms in ways that you can understand, take notes on section handouts, and make sure that you are comfortable. Your mind should never be blank given any set of conditions.</td>

Regarding course content, I had read all the bad reviews coming in and told myself I&#x27;d proved myself capable in tough situations before, so I could do okay in this class through perseverence and hard work. That doesn&#x27;t really cut it here. Unless you&#x27;re basically a chem god or have taken (and dropped out of) Chem 17 before, this class is absolutely brutal. It was honestly so discouraging to be studying so hard and putting so much time into a class and consistently getting 60&#x27;s&#x2F;70&#x27;s on exams. And I actually found a good amount of the content interesting; but somehow, even after studying for exams like it was my full&ndash;time job, they would end up feeling impossible (partly due to being ridiculously long).

In my opinion, the two keys to being somewhat successful in the class are paying attention in section and doing every last practice problem you can get your hands on. Section was soooo helpful for me because my TF had a great grasp of the material and really wanted to help us nail down the concepts. The practice problems they give you in section are so so necessary for doing well on exams, etc. Do them over and over and over again, and then go online and find more practice problems to drill. Honestly, like 65% of the exams is just being able to recognize mechanisms you&#x27;ve studied and apply what you&#x27;ve memorized from drilling problems over and over again. Smaller things to make sure you&#x27;re attentive of: 1) doing all the psets (they&#x27;re mostly graded on completion so it&#x27;s nice to have that free 100 from your pset grade) and 2) paying attention in lecture and writing down most (if not all) of the notes; it sucks, but it really makes a difference in understanding the material, and unlike in most other classes, you&#x27;ll end up reviewing your notes a lot, so it&#x27;s definitely super helpful to have clear references to go back to. The exams are...fine; they&#x27;re fair. Definitely study hard and early for the first exam because in hindsight, that was the easiest of the three and I could&#x27;ve done better if I&#x27;d prepared earlier. Definitely study early for every exam, though, but honestly, studying for exams is easier if you&#x27;ve been drilling practice problems every day. Practicing every day is honestly the most important key to this class.</td>

Having three midterms was extremely anxiety&ndash;inducing especially they are worth 80% of your grade. I felt like hours of effort were not reflected in my exam grades because there would be trick questions and disproportionate amounts of points taken off for not showing byproducts leaving even though during lecture and in some answer keys they did not show byproducts leaving. There were also trick questions on the exams that would be worth a lot of points. At times, even the head TF would struggle to solve practice midterm problems.</td>

It is a fairly tough subject, but how well you do is a direct output of how much time and practice you can put in. To be forward, I scheduled my whole semester around orgo so I can focus most of my time on this class. Do the psets early and as much on your own as you can and then go to office hours to check them. Keep a questions&#x2F;concepts list of things you keep forgetting, getting wrong, and small concepts that you hear in office hours or on psets which are helpful. This was very important for me and I asked all the built up questions in the office hours and review sessions before exams. <br/><br/>It is EXTREMELY important to build an intuition for mechanisms. Know FMO theory and the importance of atomic orbitals, HOMO&#x2F;LUMOs, sterics, and electrophilicity&#x2F;nucleophilicity VERY well. Having a solid understanding of them, how they are important in reactions (and how they can be manipulated to proceed in mechanisms) will take you far. It is important to notice trends and patterns. For example, if you see pH=5 as part of the reagents, then you KNOW that it will proceed through a zwitter ion intermediate and involves iminium formation most likely. Half of mechanism problems are basically just a series of protonation and deprotonation to make things more&#x2F;less reactive. Another big thing was to always be aware of if you are in basic or acidic conditions. That will give you 70% of what to expect for that mechanism. It is very helpful to identify and circle functional groups in the reactant since that can give you a sense of what will be reacting with what. For example, a hemiacetal in unit 1 likely mean you will open&#x2F;reform the carbon ring somehow. <br/><br/>BTW COUNT HOW MANY CARBONS ARE IN THE CHAIN, IT IS VERY HELPFUL IS REALIZING WHAT WILL REACT WITH WHAT IN REACTIONS. <br/><br/>I did not spend much time memorizing intermediate names, reaction names, signature products of reactions (although this would have been helpful), but the intuition and memory I built from a lot of practice carried me through. I developed a sense for what is&#x2F;is not allowed, what we have&#x2F;have not seen yet. For the first 2 units that took me as far as I needed. HOWEVER unit 3 does involve a lottt of memorization before intuition can be built. MAKE SURE to know sn1&#x2F;2 and e1&#x2F;2 and which is most likely to happen like you know your name. Know what is only possible in acidic conditions, and know pKa values. I only spent a little time before exams cram&ndash;memorizing pka values and functional groups and that was helpful. One small thing about unit 3 is that often when the reaction has basic conditions for step 1, and acidic conditions for step 2, whatever is the leaving group will likely deprotonate something and become neutral BEFORE you move to acidic conditions. Then the acid is used to reprotonate at the end (just write these tips down if you see this and have to take this course).<br/><br/>It is nice to have friends taking the course that you can work with and support each other on psets. When a problem gets frustrating, just step away for a second and come back with fresh eyes and you might see something you were too stressed to notice before.  Section and psets are where I learned the most</td>

Every 2 weeks, make a list of the mechanisms&#x2F;important concepts you&#x27;ve learned. Takes like 20 min&ndash;1 hour, and once I started doing it, I did much much better. Also, don&#x27;t copy PSETs from people &ndash;&ndash; if there is ONE CLASS that you actually do the psets and just ignore every other class, do it for this one.

It will probably not be your favorite semester and its very draining because there are just so many mechanisms that you do not really care about and its hard to conceptualize why everything is happening. The most helpful thing for me was to make acronyms of the steps for each of the mechanisms. Please please please learn the functional groups early on because that will help you see things quicker. Something I did not do and i really wish I did was review the lectures again after class because I would walk out of lecture more confused then when I came in but did not try to bridge those gaps in knowledge. lecture was just me copying down Tim and not really understanding the concepts so going back and reviewing is very important. MY #1 TIP: DO THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS THROUGHOUT THE WEEK AND GO TO OFFICE HOURS WHEN YOU ARE STUCK ON THEM AND DO THEM OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN BEFORE THE EXAMS. Also, take the first midterm exam extremely seriously because it will be the easiest one to get a higher grade, so you do not want the first midterm to be your drop because the exams get progressively harder believe it or not!</td>

Lectures weren&#x27;t that helpful in the moment, because it&#x27;s a lot of info to take in, but rereading the lecture slides was a huge help to me because I could go at my own pace. Ask your section TF or the TFs in office hours lots of questions, especially about concepts, so that you can develop your instincts for organic chemistry. Also, don&#x27;t be scared away if a mechanism seems really hard at first, as the more you practice, the more the steps become obvious to you.</td>

However, if they&#x27;re a student who doesn&#x27;t have the background and maybe only recently (meaning at Harvard) started developing better study habits, just get ready for that to change.

I felt that it improved my organic chemistry skills drastically compared to when I began; however, this progress&ndash;&ndash;as well as any success you hope to have in the course&ndash;&ndash;is only possible if you are willing to put in TONS of time outside of class.  Lectures are very informative, but I found them hard to pay attention to at times because the material was presented in a dull way.  You absolutely need to be self&ndash;motivated and do practice problems on your own and stay on top of the material week to week, as it improves your understanding exponentially.  Just doing the psets is not nearly enough, though they are super helpful.  Personally, I only felt that I was able to grasp the big picture of the material after I had studied about 60 hours for the final, because I was not able to put in enough time the rest of the year on top of my other classes.   As a result, if you need to take this class for a concentration requirement, you should go into it with the mindset that it will be really difficult and you will need to commit a lot of time to it, but it will be rewarding if you do.  If you don&#x27;t need to take it for a requirement, I would most certainly not recommend it, as I think there are more interesting and less grueling science classes to take.</td>

Great prof.<br/><br/>If you submitted an exam regrade request, this semester&#x27;s Head TF Jason received your request and sat down to find questions where he could remove more points, so your exam grade would be lower than it initially was. It got to the point where other TFs were warning students not to submit regrade requests unless they looked at the exam first to ensure their grade wouldn&#x27;t be reduced by Jason. Would strongly recommend more restrictions&#x2F;regulations being placed on TFs who sign up to administer the course, as this sort of behavior should not be tolerated.</td>

But if you are willing to put in the work, you will learn a lot and be successful. Don&#x27;t worry if a midterm doesn&#x27;t go well! You&#x27;ll have a chance to bring your grade up. This class truly does take a lot of effort, but it&#x27;s pretty enjoyable. If you like organic chemistry, you&#x27;ll find the problem sets and lectures very interesting. But be ready for the workload!! You&#x27;ve got this :).</td>

It is hard, but also it is not `Impossible`<br/>E) In my opinion, do not waste summer before CHEM17 self studying for it. much of the learning with the course is done in section and doing problems. you will forget small details you need to know for exams</td>
