Start p sets early, give up on the idea of sleep, and collaborate. This is a very fast&ndash;paced environment, so make sure you still find time to appreciate and enjoy what you are learning. Time management is essential to completing your other work done in addition to these class assignments. Since many of us were deciding between 25 and 55, Harris told us at the beginning of the course that what determines whether you stay in 55 is whether you enjoy the material. I will say that I enjoyed the class more at the beginning because now it has become a ton of work once you factor in the workload from other classes. The CAs take forever to grade assignments so once we get feedback it is no longer relevant because we are working on a new subject.  However, Harris is overall a good lecturer if not a little hand&ndash;wavy at times.</td>

While the course description says that there is no prerequisite, it will be magnitudes harder for students without adequate preparation to do well in this course. If you don&#x27;t have experience in proof&ndash;writing, linear algebra, and group theory, then this class will just take up more time for you than what the average says on the Q&ndash;guide.</td>

However, I do think if you are fairly comfortable with proofs, this is definitely a class worth considering (even with the death of shopping period, I believe you can still sit in the first couple weeks on 22&#x2F;25&#x2F;55 to get a taste). In particular, I think the most important predictor of your successor will be your dedication. I don&#x27;t mean that in the sense you need to dedicate every waking hour to this class, far from it, but you will need to spend time reviewing class notes and spending time working on the PSETs. I think it is easy in this class as well as other math classes to essentially be spoon fed solutions in office hours. I think it is valuable to struggle with a problem for maybe an hour or two (maybe longer) and only then seek help (and try to think about the intuition for why a solution might work!). I think that&#x27;s especially important for this class, because almost more than any other math class I&#x27;ve seen (having taken multi, linear, and multi upper divisions before) the class material is cumulative and routinely, results on previous PSETs are used as intermediate results in a future PSET question.  Overall though, if you are someone who genuinely enjoys math, I think this class is great. Harris teaches the material phenomenally and motivates many key ideas, boosting your own understanding of the material. I also think the community of people you meet in this class is quite supportive and many could be classmates in other future classes and friends.</td>

Professor Harris has been really helpful in getting us to learn about maths concepts for which we haven&#x27;t gained intuition for through explaining the motivation for understanding and applying each idea that he introduces &ndash; which has been key in helping me grow as a mathematician. Favourite part of the course was representation theory: really helps you see the connection between abstract and linear algebra that you will miss if you did 25a then 122. For those worrying about the workload &ndash; p sets are long and it is always difficult to quantify exactly how long you would take to finish a p set: what I should have done and what I will do in 55b, is just shave off a chunk of around 25&ndash;30 hours every week to work related to this class: understanding every theorem and idea, doing my p set (this should take a little less than I suggested if you are a regular math lounge visitor), and lectures. CAs for this course have usually been in your position, so feel free to ask them for support. For anyone worrying about pre&ndash;reqs: there essentially aren&#x27;t any; I would even go so far as to advise against preparing too far ahead in advance because it ruins the experience: you will find the course easy until it eventually goes beyond what you have done and you will suddenly find yourself lost for the first time. In a nutshell, for those with a big ego and those who seek academic validation: don&#x27;t take math 55; for those who are interested in growing as a mathematician and learning for the sake of learning: this is an amazing experience.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_c50c2ad8-a928-4d4c-b95a-a967030252b7">Overall I had a very positive experience with Math 55a. I believe most of the people in the class would tell you this is by far their favorite class (naturally) as a consequence of us spend the most time on this course and with other students solving the problems. I made an absolutely amazing group of friends through this class, who are not only passionate about math but also very study&ndash;focused, kind, collaborative, and hard working. If you want to get your college experience started off on the right foot by making a group of supportive, hard&ndash;working, and curious friends, this is THE way to go. Moreover, if you could handle it, finishing this course gives you the unshakable confidence you can handle whatever challenge and class that comes in the future at Harvard as this is probably the most intensive math experience you could get here. That is not to say one would necessarily become cocky; my classmates constantly dazzle me with their brilliance and curiosity and I also needed to seek out computational problems to fill in the holes in the applied side of things. We had an exposure of a wide range of higher level mathematics, and I felt my brain constantly expanding and challenged during this course as if I caught a glimpse of something sublime, an experience that is hard to replicate in the other freshman math courses. However, we barely did any computational problems or applications, and Math 25a taught more applications of linear algebra than Math 55a (though it is relatively easy to self study these applications, one could just ask 25a friends for their notes). <br/><br/>If you are deciding between Math 25a and Math 55a like I was in the beginning of the year, I highly recommend sitting into both classes in the first week of class, and by the end of the second week you most definitely would know which class fits you better. Ideally, I recommend students who have taken&#x2F;self studied a course on abstract algebra and a course on linear algebra to take this course. Personally I did not have any abstract algebra background coming in and I felt very behind than some other students in the first few weeks of class. However, I also have a few friends who came in with only calculus and linear algebra knowledge. Competition math experience might be slightly helpful but definitely not necessary, I personally was not a USAMO qualifier (though many classmates are) and I was able to handle the class just fine; I think the psets mostly test the understanding of complex material, perhaps 2 or 3 questions out of 10 questions require extensive problem solving. <br/><br/>By virtue of putting some of the brightest kids into one classroom there were some getting used to in the beginning of the year. I remember the first two weeks or so the class was not necessarily the most welcoming as classmates wanted to prove themselves, but very quickly the classroom environment became mature and welcoming, very much a big family. So don&#x27;t be intimidated by other students in the beginning, breathe.<br/><br/>I wish someone told me what to do in the summer before freshman year to prepare for Math 55a, so here: there are roughly four &#x27;units&#x27; &ndash; introduction to abstract algebra, linear algebra, harder group theory stuff, then ending with representation theory that ties linear algebra and group theory together. The first and third unit heavily relied on Artin&#x27;s Algebra, the second unit basically covered the entire Linear Algebra Done Right book by Axler, and the last unit was based on the first 40 pages of Representation Theory written by Professor Harris himself. We ran through Artin chapter 2 in the beginning of the year then we just speed ran Axler, if possible I recommend reading through the first 5 chapters of Axler and Artin chapter 2.<br/><br/>Coming in I was also curious what other Math 55a students took alongside this course in the fall. From my experience it seems that many students took Stat 110, a decent amount took CS 50 (a handful took CS 121 or CS 61), and many chose to have at least one Gen Ed or freshman seminar.<br/><br/>On the question of balance: Taking Math 55a  does in many ways throw one into a grind culture. I did cut down my involvement in clubs and sometimes I could not check out opportunities I would liked to see if I did not have a pset due in two days. Looking back, I think one needs to constantly remind oneself to put quality social interactions above the problem sets. We were told there were only 5 late days for the semester but in reality the CAs are very lenient and you pretty much can take as many late days as you wish. I wish I learnt about this earlier so I could be less stressed and focused on always turning in the psets on time every Wednesday and be more present around my friends and intentionally spend more time socializing early on in the semester. <br/><br/>The midterm was relatively easy and mostly meant as a check on if you know what is going on. The final was very difficult and I recommend starting it as early as possible during reading period. However, most of the grade depends on the problem sets and if you did well on the midterm do not worry too much about the final. <br/><br/>My biggest advice for studying: I find reading the relevant lecture notes&#x2F;textbook sections before lecture then come to lecture to ask questions then do problem sets to review the most helpful, or else having lecture be one&#x27;s first introduction to some abstract material could be hard to understand. As for pset groups, I recommend trying to work with different people in the beginning of the year,;there is no shame in asking if other want to pset together as most people are willing to experiment, people start to form semi&ndash;fixed groups around week 4, though I continued to try pset with different people to make close friendships and that is totally possible as well.  Moreover, Tuesday nights and Wednesday nights at the math lounge you can always find people who are willing to work together.<br/><br/>The CA&#x27;s pset feedbacks were not the most helpful as they are always 5 weeks behind on grading the problem sets. But some sections&#x2F;office hours are helpful and I highly recommend checking out as many of them out as possible in the beginning of the year to see which CAs you find the most helpful&#x2F;vibe with.<br/><br/>Overall, Math 55a is an amazing course!!! I highly recommend at least coming to a few lectures to check it out. Best of luck with Harvard and everything that comes with it!</td>

I was very on the fence about taking this course but braved through the first few psets (the first is easy, the second is the hardest of all of them) and decided to continue. The CAs are awesome and quite knowledgeable. The professor is great (go to his office hours, they rock). As far as math background goes, obviously you&#x27;ll want to be a solid math student. Plenty of the kids in the class have extensive math olympiad experience (e.g. IMO, USAMO) but that is far from a requirement. I personally barely weasled my way into the AIME, was captain of my school&#x27;s math team, and had taken course in Lin Alg&#x2F;Multi. I had done some logic proofs but nothing like what we did in 55. This background, while far more modest than many in 55, was more than good enough to keep up and succeed in the course. Learning LaTeX and how to write proofs was not very difficult. The course content is hard but the biggest challenge of the class is the workload. When people say it will make the primary focus of your semester Mathematics, they are correct. The 20 hours a week (although 12&ndash;16 if you collaborate well) are very real and take time away from other things. I don&#x27;t regret taking the course but I might not take it next semester considering the massive time commitment. It&#x27;s a great course and really gives you a unique perspective on mathematics (strongly recommend it for pure math concentrators). The other kids in the class are really cool and collaboration is key to succeeding in 55. Also, be ready to go hard on the final (quite doable but time consuming). Good luck to all you future 55ers. You got this.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_c50c2ad8-a928-4d4c-b95a-a967030252b7">Amazing class! Probably the two main reasons to take the class: <br/><br/> &ndash; The community. You will meet many very supportive students in 55 who will become your lifelong friends. Some call it trauma bonding, and while there might be some of that element to it, the late&ndash;night (or early&ndash;day) problem&ndash;set sessions are a great way to both learn math and have fun in the breaks. The element of collaboration of mathematics is definitely an important part of the class, and you can both learn from and give insights to fellow classmates. <br/> &ndash; The material: 55 gives a very good foundation to continue studying math. In addition, it is taught in a way that seems to emphasize abstraction (e.g., not much work with matrices is done). This results in less busywork calculations and I think a more in&ndash;depth understanding and ability to think abstractly, which will be very important in future studies of math. Problem sets have useful and helpful content (occasionally can be long and windy, but there are many surprising and cool results in them, and finishing any long problem both gives the wonderful feeling of exhilaration and also knowledge gained).<br/><br/>Probably the biggest reservation would be the time spent, but the hours you do spend on the problem sets will be worth it (for the aforementioned reasons). The problem sets are fairly long, but this encourages a greater familiarity and understanding of these important mathematical objects. If you are a prospective math major, this will definitely help when you take future math classes (e.g., groups&#x2F;vector spaces are absolutely fundamental and also representation theory is a nice bridge between them; there is also an introduction to rings&#x2F;modules and tensors, both of which are quite relevant. One of our CAs also held additional sections to introduce material covered in later classes).</td>

This class is amazing and will teach you so much about algebra, and not just the surface&ndash;level linear algebra you might be thinking of. Don&#x27;t trust the people who say this class takes 60+ hours a week or that you need to have gone to IMO to take it, it doesn&#x27;t and you don&#x27;t.

This is not a philosophical journey or a bonding expedition, it&#x27;s a math class. It will not be worth it unless you really really like the material. That being said, the material is great.

My background coming into the class was as follows. I did some competition math; I&#x27;d taken  linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and real analysis; I also went to Ross, where I learned number theory. All of this was helpful, but I don&#x27;t think that it was explicitly necessary. I think that the main prerequisite is a genuine interest in mathematics. If you enjoy rigorous, proof&ndash;based math and you feel committed to spending many hours a week solving problems, I would recommend this class to you. <br/><br/>This class has changed my perception of what I am capable of. Quite frankly, I didn&#x27;t know that I could learn this much in three months. Looking back, I cannot believe that I learned as much as I did. It&#x27;s crazy to think that all these ideas that were previously foreign to me now feel so familiar.  I think this is the main reason to take this class: if you stick with it and give an honest effort, you will come out of it learning much more than you ever believed you could have learned.<br/><br/>I&#x27;d also like to characterize the workload. It is significant. I likely spent around 15&ndash;20 hours a week for this class. There was the rare 10 hour week, and the rare 25 hour week, but it is usually quite consistently around the 15&ndash;20 hour mark. If you take this class, I encourage you to put in that honest effort. The ideas build in this class quite quickly, so things can start to get confusing pretty quickly if you start to not understand a few concepts. Reading the textbook on your own to supplement the lecture itself was something I did to stay on track, and I found it immensely helpful. <br/><br/>As others will likely mention, the community is superb. There is a genuine feeling that everyone wants everyone else to do well in this class. If you don&#x27;t know how to do a problem, people will give hints or explain solutions to you. If you don&#x27;t understand the concepts, you can go to one of the many office hours to get it explained. This is a difficult class, but it is made significantly easier because everyone is so kind. I made a few of my closest friends in the class.<br/><br/>In particular, Professor Harris is an incredible lecturer. He speaks with experience and poise. His presentation of material is often significantly better than the presentation in the textbooks. He is also quite friendly, and he answers questions in class wonderfully. It is not an atmosphere where it is strange to ask a &quot;silly&quot; question. I asked a lot of clarifying questions this semester, and his responses were always respectful and not the least bit condescending. I also appreciated his humility. He admitted that some of the concepts were tricky and that he didn&#x27;t get them the first time he saw them either. To see a professor admit he struggled with the concepts too made our struggle feel more normal. <br/><br/>Finally, I&#x27;d like to offer some advice. Start your problem sets early. When I looked around during the semester, those who started early always seemed much less stressed out than those who started late. Try to solve as many of the problems as you can: it&#x27;s tempting to ask others for solutions, but it&#x27;s much more rewarding when you give it your honest effort yourself. <br/><br/>As a summary, this class is difficult. It requires something of you, but in the most rewarding way. I believe that if you give something of yourself to it—your time, your care, your interest—you will receive something truly worthwhile in return.</td>

Additionally, the math contents get harder and more abstract in the second half of the term, and this is true for any course, so even if you seem to handle it well at the beginning of the term, there is no guarantee you will be handling it at all in the second half.
