This is mostly true. Jacob is one of the most passionate, knowledgeable, and down&ndash;to&ndash;earth professor I had this semester, he truly reminds me of Richard Feynman the great explainer. However, the course is not without its downsides. For one thing the psets are not very enlightening, they are mostly computational and do not give much insights into the material covered in lecture, just 7 hours of crunch work. About one out of three lectures are purely mathematics, stuff like deriving the Lagrangians, vector calculus basics, were covered in class time. Moreover we had a pset 13 which almost no other class has and it was due during reading period, making it quite inconvenient studying for other exams. I am not exactly sure how much I am going to retain from this course, if I could do it again I might chose to audit this course instead of enrolling in it to gain the beautiful lectures but not sit through the psets.</td>

I struggled back in high school and didn&#x27;t find the material very interesting. I thought that Physics 19 would really show me the beauty of physics and encourage me to learn more. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, I still do not feel that way about physics now. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Physics 19 is very solid. However,  going into the semester I didn&#x27;t really understand what was different about a survey course from a more traditional STEM course. Hence, my expectations of learning profound ideas and becoming captivated by beautiful problems were not completely fulfilled. Jacob is an incredible lecturer, definitely a contender for one of the best at Harvard. He doesn&#x27;t use any notes and is able to deliver a lecture jam&ndash;packed with content every class without fail. However, some lectures just end up becoming him deriving a bunch of equations on the board. His typed course notes are very good, although they are also very long. Sometimes it became too overwhelming to read them in their entirety. The assignments were great at helping me review the content, but to be honest, I would usually start them a day or two before they were due because they were not very hard. This was doable because they often just boiled down to doing a handful of algebraic manipulations. Lastly, the final project was pretty much just the equivalent of one pset problem. This was good in terms of being a low&ndash;stress assignment, but part of me wishes we had a more complete, fulfilling final project.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think that Physics 19 is a very solid course, and definitely great if you are just looking for an interesting, well&ndash;run exposure to the key concepts of physics. However, it is ultimately a survey course that lacks some depth unless you really try to explore the topics further either through office hours or on your own.</td>

It was an absolutely amazing experience. Professor Barandes is an incredibly welcoming and understanding person, and has several unparalleled qualities about him, including that he is able to remember so much information and relevant stories that are carefully conveyed and intelligently woven into his lectures.  He is unbelievably knowledgeable, and he will stay for literally an hour or two afterwards and answer questions, and explain new topics to you. He really cares. Furthermore, it speaks for itself that that he was able to consolidate and really encapsulate the essence of almost every major realm of physics leading up to (and including, which was really cool!!) the development of quantum mechanics in an accessible but thorough and un&ndash;simplified way. By covering in broad sweeps all of the important realms of physics from throughout its past, this class was in a lot of ways a history of physics, and felt like a 31&ndash;course intellectual meal. Every lecture provided something new and exciting. <br/>Now, I took 15a before this course, but as someone with a passion for learning and a curiosity about a lot of disciplines in science, I felt that I wanted a class that showed me what physics &#x27;is about&#x27;. And physics 19 sure delivered. This was unlike any other introductory STEM class I&#x27;ve taken; this helped me solidify my choice to study physics.  I feel this class should be required alongside physics 15a, they&#x27;re really each of a very different breed, and this class is just fantastic. For the physics student, 15a teaches you how to think about and solve classical mechanics and special relativity problems well. This is important. Physics 19 sends you on an intellectual rollercoaster and makes you question and think about the philosophical experience of understanding the inner workings of the universe. This is important for a deeper reason. It gets you excited about studying physics; I had my intellectual and physics boundaries pushed in so many different directions, leaving me feeling like I gained a tender awareness of what physics &#x27;is about&#x27;, the soul of it, this ever&ndash;growing tapestry of knowledge, as seen through so many other historical figures who gave their lives to its development and all it can now account for in Nature. <br/>And again: it&#x27;s accessible! You don&#x27;t actually need to have taken a physics course before this! Having an interest in physics is all that is necessary, and being interested in deep questions is a plus&ndash;&ndash;Barandes&#x27; specialty is physics and philosophy, and this combines both.</td>

Jacob is an insanely dedicated course head (he stays behind after every lecture to take as many questions as he can, gave us bonus lectures about general relativity&#x2F;quantum entanglement during reading period just out of interest, and is incredibly committed to ensuring a welcoming atmosphere). <br/><br/>I&#x27;d recommend not taking too many other pset classes along with this one &ndash;&ndash; I regret that I was unable to engage with the material as deeply as I would&#x27;ve liked just for lack of time!

During the semester, I felt very unsure about how I felt about the class. Sometimes I really enjoyed it, but other times I really did not. Now that the semester is over, I now have a clearer view.<br/><br/>I think this class is great, provided that you have the right expectations about what you&#x27;re getting into. This is not a class where you&#x27;ll learn anything thoroughly. However, in exchange, you&#x27;ll learn a lot about a variety of subjects.

In short, this class provides breadth, not depth.<br/><br/>In this way, I think the best way to take this class is with a completely open mind. Just enjoy all the topics. Don&#x27;t expect to understand all of them. But if you like something, you can always take more classes in it later. <br/><br/>Professor Barandes is a great lecturer, but above all, he is a fantastic human being.

Homework problems guide you through amazing discoveries in the history of physics rather than making you calculate a minimum necessary coefficient of friction. While some calculus will be helpful, the course is very accessible and not just directed at physics concentrators. The class requires some work, but it is very manageable, and Dr. Barandes is very generous with his time after class and in office hours. Finally, though the course does not try to teach you any area of physics in great depth, it gives you a basic understanding of a wide range of topics and shows you which ones interest you. Whether you are curious about concentrating in physics or just want to take an enjoyable class, I highly recommend Physics 19.</td>

You have to weigh the pros and cons of the two courses. LPSA is easy to do well but is an incredible amount of lab time and work. I did not want to be restricted by class and lab time so I took this course. Yes there are three lectures and a challenging pset ever week but I PROMISE it is way better and way less total time. You have a grace deadline for the psets if you have a busy week, there are enough psets so that if you do ok on one it wont tank your grade, the TFs grade them based on effort and completion rather than correctness which is great, the final project was simple and fun, and you can spread your workload however you choose. It is way better than being constrained to crazy long lab hours. The class is overall low stress IF YOU GO TO OFFICE HOURS WITH JACOB EVERY WEEK (or have a friend who goes). He carries you through the psets and legit carried me through the class. He realizes the content can be difficult at times and wants students to succeed so it is important that you or a friend in the class goes at least once a week (friday mornings with him were the best as he usually walked through the most difficult pset problem in full).

You&#x27;ll learn a lot of important physics on an accessible&#x2F;introductory level without it being surface&ndash;level or oversimplified.</td>

I cannot praise him highly enough.<br/>The psets are very manageable, and office hours are very helpful if you do get stuck.  The grading is very lenient.<br/>The final project is very chill.  It&#x27;s basically a problem set centered around a specific topic.  He introduced it to us a week before it was due, and we all got it done in time.</td>

Incredible lectures, a good variety of course material, a truly outstanding professor. Seriously, take this class to meet Jacob alone! Although do be aware that this class is not a breeze and requires investment from its students (though lenient assignment policies keep the class from being too overbearing).</td>

Especially if you don’t consider yourself a “physics person” I would highly recommend giving this course a shot, because it’s so well structured to introduce people to concepts and rudimentary calculations without requiring uh background. This could be the second chance you give physics.</td>

It covers mechanics, of course, but in a new way, and looks at a lot of other really cool things like quantum mechanics and relativity (special and even general). You really get a good review of so many physics topics which was so fun! And it is not insanely difficult. You definitely get what you put into it (in terms of comprehension—grade&ndash;wise it is super easy).  Lectures are really interesting (though sometimes you get lost in the maths in the proofs). Although they dont check if you do this or not and you can get through teh course without doing it, READ THE LECTURE NOTES!! If you are actually interesting in getting the material (ie if you are a physics concentrator), you should really read them after every class because they explain things really well and help reinforce the material. GO TO OFFICE HOURS!!!!!!!!! THIS IS IMPORTANT! That way you not only get help on the problem but actually start to understand the intuition of problems and I always learn more when I go. I also met lots of friends that way.</td>
