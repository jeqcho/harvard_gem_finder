Minimal to zero stress induced by this class. Professors and teaching staff are so lovely, caring, and knowledgeable about the subjects. I found the research fascinating, for example, during the &quot;light&quot; lecture we learned about some groundbreaking work Prof. Czeisler did decades ago that showed how powerful of a synchronizer light is with respect to circadian rhythms. What are circadian rhythms? How can blind people still have their circadian rhythms synchronized by light? Also, many real life examples are provided during lecture and it&#x27;s very cool to see how the professors&#x27; research directly improves shift workers&#x27; schedules in the UK, or Shaq &#x2F; other NBA players&#x27; performances, for instance. Though I would often want to skip lecture, as it is a two hour long lecture, I realized that the in person experience is actually incredibly fun and interesting. The professors are really funny and try to answer students&#x27; questions... even the silly ones. Sure, some may say this class is common sense and a lot of the main concepts are common sense, but sitting in lecture hearing startling figures of motor vehicle crashes due to lack of sleep, or hearing about how these common sense concepts were discovered, or hearing about the impact of this research is very interesting and I think everyone should take this class to become more informed on this important topic.</td>

The time commitment isn&#x27;t that bad when you consider those of some other geneds, but I easily spent around 10 hours on the sleep reporting assignment on that week. The presentation and other grading criteria aren&#x27;t very clear, but the TFs are helpful. Section is boring and useless, lecture can be boring, but seeing your sleep tracking data can be cool. This course DOES HAVE A FINAL NOW, which is completely unnecessary after all the work we&#x27;ve done already.

It does depend on who you get, though, because some TFs can be stricter with grading. Overall, it&#x27;s honestly not that hard. The main change is addition of the final exam (which was moderately challenging but very fair) and addition of reading quizzes and post&ndash;lecture quizzes (which were relatively easy even if you didn&#x27;t do the reading before).

The rubrics for the assignments are very clear, so as long as you follow them, it&#x27;s quite difficult to not get a 100 on all of them.

The reading comprehension quizzes at the beginning of the classes are also awful and at the beginning of the semester they tested the most obscure parts of the readings, but they did get better towards the end of the semester.

Pay attention during class and focus on bigger, overarching concepts. Become comfortable with using Excel because it is helpful for the sleep tracking project. Do not miss lecture because otherwise you will have to write a response paper to make up for it. Do not be afraid of approaching any of the professors or TFs &ndash; they are extremely friendly and willing to help.</td>

We have 3 open&ndash;ended questions as a pre&ndash;class quiz based on the unnecessarily dense scientific readings you are assigned as well as 3 questions after the lecture is done. In addition to a final exam, be warned that there is also a final exam for some incredibly odd reason. It&#x27;s unbelievable that a class meant for people to learn some cool stuff about sleep and fulfill a gened requirement is transformed into somewhat of a painful experience every time there&#x27;s a lecture and additional work in preparing for the final exam. Please avoid this class if possible and pick something else to fulfill your science requirement. Whoever proposed these changes is really out of touch with why students choose particular classes, so do us a favor and don&#x27;t take this class.</td>

Would recommend to those who are willing to take on a non&ndash;trivial amount of work to learn about those things, and knock out a Science GENED requirement in the process.</td>
