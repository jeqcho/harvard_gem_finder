The texts that are covered are all fascinating in their own way, and you&#x27;ll learn a lot from your professors, TFs and peers, especially about the texts that you thought were the least interesting from the syllabus or synopsis. The type of student to take Hum10 is also quite self&ndash;selecting; you&#x27;ll likely meet some really cool and really... interesting people through it, but going in with an open mind will make it a really fruitful experience. If you find it&#x27;s not for you, you can always drop it as well, though you&#x27;ll probably have a really great time learning and analysing the texts with them if you&#x27;re even considering Hum10 in the first place.</td>

I almost chickened out but the course was not as difficult as it seemed, the main time suck is reading. Because my other classes were relatively work&ndash;light, I found time to read all the books. It was my favorite class and I looked forward to every lecture, seminar, and writing lab. People can be intense (I was a bit intimidated by how smart everyone was) but super interesting and friendly. My seminar prof (Simmons) and writing TF (ET Stone) were both the best. I would especially recommend if your writing skills are relatively good and you’re willing to accept less than an A for your final grade.</td>

As long as you read most books, sparknotes the ones you don&#x27;t have time for, and catch up over thanksgiving and reading period, you will do fine in the class. Essays are graded pretty leniently, and you have large amounts of freedom over which texts you choose to write about.

The professors are excellent at making sometimes inaccessible texts exciting, and every lecture revolutionized my understanding of the literary canon.  Section was also amazing:  I thought my professor and section TF both facilitated enriching discussions. I had very little experience with academic writing coming into college, so writing lab was sometimes unhelpful. The model lacks direct instruction. Instead of being told how to write a paper, you&#x27;re told how NOT to write a paper, and you&#x27;re expected to figure it out from there. While I don&#x27;t think this should dissuade anyone from taking the course, it&#x27;s something to be aware of if you lacked academic writing instruction in high school. With that being said, I thought the paper prompts themselves were fun to work with, and I produced some of my best academic work through this class.<br/><br/>The main thing I think potential students should be wary of is not course material&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;it&#x27;s course culture. I think Hum10 attracts a lot of private school&#x2F;prep school students, even more than Harvard already does, and that background becomes apparent as the semester goes on. Many of my classmates were passionate, brilliant people, but I also witnessed a lot of pretentiousness and elitism. Again, I wouldn&#x27;t want this to dissuade anyone from taking the course, but it is something that I noticed more than I did in my other classes.<br/><br/>All that said, if you love literature, then Hum10 is a life&ndash;changing course.

In past years, you did not have to read all the books to do well, but I guess too many people did this because this year we have an exam where we need to identify passages lol. But even then, I really recommend reading all the books. Even from the ones you do not enjoy so much, there is something to learn. There is so much variety in the texts, you are bound to like at least one if you love reading at all, and the professors — some of the leading experts on the genres and authors in the WORLD (crazy) — are very accessible, friendly, and passionate. I would say main reason to do this class would be for the inspiring lectures. Second reason is if you want to time and an excuse to read a lot of interesting books. Hum 10 is a class that fosters a deep love for learning, a love for understanding humanity, a love for art. You need to love reading &amp; love analyzing texts on your own.

You need to really work to find community here, because the seminars meeting only once a week frankly feels a little insufficient (though I do recognize that these professors and TFs are probably taking time that doesn&#x27;t necessarily exist in of their already busy schedules to teach teenagers). There are group events meant to foster community but lots of them are very &quot;quirky&quot; and happen at hours of the day where lots of people aren&#x27;t free. Though I was surprised to find that most of the students were those stereotypical pretentious humanities types &ndash; yeah, they definitely existed, but most of the people were very sweet and fun to talk to.</td>

The reading is heavy, you will always find yourself reading it leaves you feeling like you never really have free time because you always could be doing work for hum 10.  The biggest caveat to this class is that they do curve the papers, they have certain grade distributions that they want to hit, roughly 20% A, 50% A&ndash; and 30% B+ and below so if you&#x27;re someone that had a 5.0 in high school and still loves a flawless GPA this is not the right class for you. This class is worth it for the lectures and your seminar discussions though, where you really get to learn about texts in an interesting, engaging way. Writing lab is a bit of a waste of time (not the fault of the TFs, expos curriculum is just poor in general)</td>

Lectures and seminars are often very productive and mindblowing, however, it is only worth it if you put in the time to read all the books. This is not an easy writing course — the grading is probably comparable to Expos, and we are not given the rubric with which Writing TFs grade. There is also a final on all the books, which doesn&#x27;t feel strictly necessary.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_60bf52f0-d024-4807-a703-414eb62787b4">I am going to be honest here. HUM10 is not as hard as people make it sound like, but it definitely isn&#x27;t for everybody. The reading part was not the hardest for me &ndash;&ndash; I like reading, I didn&#x27;t have a super heavy schedule, and I committed myself to reading all books (most people skip 1 or 2). The final is also not that bad, just make sure you keep track of concepts introduced in lecture and know key elements and plots of each book. Section discussion is not easy because most people are super smart, but that is enriching and it is not that hard to get in the conversations (of course the section leader you get can make all the difference). Museum and opera visits were fun. The writing portion is where this class became a joke, because the writing labs and feedback are mostly useless. The expectation they have is that you can already write a literary analysis essay well enough (don&#x27;t be expected to be taught, just to be badly guided through). For some people expos would be better. Most kids in this class will have gone to elite private schools and taken AP, IB, Honors Literature or History and even diminish the assignments or feel entitled to get an A on a paper. There was one lecture where a professor asked who had been to the Louvre and seen Mona Lisa in person and over two thirds of the class raised their hands. So beware that the environment can belittle your background and make you feel awkward because of your past academic and life experiences. But I still met some nice people in this class (don&#x27;t buy the &quot;community building&quot; talk, though. It is not that much true).  Make sure to go to office hours and just talk to the amazing heads teaching this class &ndash;&ndash; I got an autograph from a Pulitzer Prize winner, and he knows my name!<br/>With that being said, I am glad I took this and read 12 books I might have never read (the most prolific 4 months of my life in terms of reading). It was challenging to find myself within the class, but if you think you have a passion for reading, writing, and raising questions, consider taking it. Just consider your writing background first, and see if your schedule allows you to read a book a week. Oh, and hum10 gives you status around campus (not joking, people respect hum10 kids more! I don&#x27;t know why). Hum10 is a capstone, and you can&#x27;t look back at freshman year without thinking of all the stress, crazy greek terms, and lessons you learned here. Hum10 is definitely an experience...good or bad? that depends on how you look at it.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_60bf52f0-d024-4807-a703-414eb62787b4">Don’t take this class unless you think you would actively be missing something in your schedule by not taking it. If you get lucky with your section leader and have a strong connection to them I think you can get a lot out of it but for me it felt like a stressful book club that I didn’t quite have time for and then I was expected to write essays and take a test on the material. Some of the lectures were very interesting but it was tough to spend so long reading a book only to talk about it during one lecture and one hour long discussion. That said it did expose me to a number of texts I would otherwise have not read and gave a LITTLE bit of insight into a couple of humanities disciplines. I’ll also note that I struggled to find the time needed to really delve into a deep reading for each text which likely contributed to me not liking the course. Many of my peers who did find that time and had good section leaders love the course.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_60bf52f0-d024-4807-a703-414eb62787b4">They advertise this class heavily in the pre&ndash;frosh emails, so many students might come to the Q guide to check it out. Some of you will undoubtedly decide that it&#x27;s not for you based on your interests, and that&#x27;s probably the right decision for you. I preface with this because I know there are several kids who take this class when they shouldn&#x27;t, or, at least, they don&#x27;t end up liking it because of the subject matter or the intensity. Those of you who really want to take it should know the following: it&#x27;s hard. The books can be long and demanding, especially in a week. Some of them you won&#x27;t like. Each professor chooses two that they want to teach, the implication being that there&#x27;s no mandated diversity or breadth. Invariably they&#x27;ll be interesting, but be forewarned that you might disagree with some choices. You will write two essays and complete a dozen seminar assignments, which, depending on your professor or TF, could be a short discussion post or a full page of writing. People will stress out about the exams a lot, but I promise, if you read the books, you&#x27;ll be fine. I&#x27;m serious, it&#x27;s never as bad as it seems. You could easily end up loving this class, especially the people in it. It will doubtless be onerous, but it will also be intellectually awe&ndash;inspiring and exhilarating. It changed me, and I&#x27;ve really, really enjoyed it. Overall, I would recommend this class as long as you know what you&#x27;re getting into.</td>

On one hand, this allows you to be broadly exposed to a range of texts from a wide variety of time periods. On the other hand, you never get an opportunity for the in&ndash;depth exploration of any single one that you might like. It can almost feel disappointing that there is not more time to spend exploring each book, especially after you put in all of the time to reading it. But know going into the course that a large part of the learning will come just from you reading and engaging with the texts on your own. I really enjoyed the lectures and the opportunity to have &ndash; not one &ndash; but 6 different professors, each with their own expertise. The seminars are interesting and engaging, but at times it can feel like there is an unnecessary pressure as students are trying to demonstrate their knowledge of the books. Overall, I am glad for the opportunity to have read many of the books and learn more about the topics surrounding them. If you also are looking for this type of exploration and the (definitely manageable) challenge of reading a book a week , this course is for you!</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_60bf52f0-d024-4807-a703-414eb62787b4">It would require a huge amount of work to always be fully prepared&#x2F;up to speed in this course. The course is very much what you put into it—that being said, there is still something to gain even if you cannot read the entirety of every single book. The lectures and seminar discussions are highly productive and interesting, and the course is still doable, even if you&#x27;re not in a place to give it your complete all.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_60bf52f0-d024-4807-a703-414eb62787b4">tl;dr Definitely interesting but not remotely worthwhile. <br/>PROS: The books and the lectures are the reason to take this course. One should intend to do all of the reading with at most one exception. This class is far too much of a commitment (there is an absurd amount of busy work) to take without an intention to read a large portion of the material. If you like hearing elucidating description and analysis of great works of literature (which you should; its fun) these lectures will be extremely enjoyable. If you are good at speeding through high school english paper style assignments (which, given your situation, you probably are), the value of the readings and lectures may outweigh the burden of the assignments.<br/>CONS: The expos requirement of the course ruins its structure. The papers have no relation to the overall goal of understanding relationships between texts. The writing lab is extremely repetitive and aims to teach material using a set of texts which are not remotely suited to the pedagogical goals. The assignments are extremely labor intensive without any intellectual purpose. The paper feedback and grading focuses almost exclusively on structure and stylistic without any interest in the validity or quality of analysis. The goal is to write towards a secret yet firm rubric as opposed to saying something interesting.  Instead of one semester of this, you are signing up for two. The need to prepare for the final exam is the only officially imposed incentive to seek understanding of the books.  Of course, a 3h exam is inherently a surface&ndash;level evaluation, which is not necessarily a bad thing.<br/>Another important con for me was the quality of the section.</td>
