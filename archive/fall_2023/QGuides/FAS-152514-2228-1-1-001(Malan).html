It is not a no&ndash;work course but the work is enough for you to meaningfully engage with the material without wanting to die. I&#x27;ll say that you do get as much out of the course as you put into it so show up as much as you can, start the psets early, ask questions, consider attending lab, tutorials and office hours, etc. The content you will be taught in this course will be extremely useful and important for you to learn no matter where you end up career&ndash;wise. It&#x27;s much less about the languages you learn and much more about the ideas and concepts communicated and taught through those languages and the thought process you acquire on how to tackle coding problems: as Malan calls it, the &quot;intellectual enterprises of computer science&quot;. You&#x27;ll quickly learn that the languages are just vessels and they&#x27;re so easy to hijack using online syntax and documentation.</td>

Even if you have some CS background, I would strongly recommend taking CS50 and not skipping ahead to a more challenging CS class immediately, mainly for the whole experience of taking CS50. The weekly lunches, Puzzle Day, Hackathon, and Fair were all fantastic experiences that improved my first&ndash;semester experience. I was also able to learn some new concepts such as memory management in C, Flask in Python, and how to design better code in general. If you are newer to computer science, you might find that there is a steeper learning code and end up spending a lot of time on p&ndash;sets and assignments. If you find yourself struggling, I think there are a lot of fantastic resources for this course that help make sure that everyone has an opportunity to learn. The last thing is that the lectures are pretty long and tend to become hard to follow at times, so always look for the course notes and rewatch the recordings in case you missed something.

There are over 50+ tutorials per week which are small 6&ndash;student sections to help with the PSETs with consistent Office Hours every single Sunday. If you are willing to put in the work for this class, then it&#x27;s not necessarily horrible and can be extremely engaging. You learn an immense amount of information in this course very quickly. I&#x27;d highly recommend starting the PSETs early in the week because it will make your life so much easier in the course. Oftentimes if you started the PSETs on Tuesday, you could reasonably get them finished by Thursday&#x2F;Friday and then you didn&#x27;t have to worry about them on the weekend which was nice. Absolutely use the tutorials to your advantage: it&#x27;s not worth it to spend 2&ndash;3 hours trying to debug one small thing that a TF could easily figure out for you. <br/><br/>Weeks 0&ndash;4 are too bad in the class. The workload in Week 5 gets really heavy and demanding. Weeks 6&ndash;8 are a breeze because you&#x27;re basically learning Python which is just a more user&ndash;friendly version of what you learned through Weeks 0&ndash;5. Week 9 is pretty heavy and you should definitely start the PSET early this week, especially given that the test is the following week. <br/><br/>Despite the mixed reviews, I think this class is extremely helpful, even if you don&#x27;t want to go into CS. I once had a friend tell me that they learned everything in CS50 that they needed for the Meta SWE internship they did the following summer if that&#x27;s any consolation of the amount of information you&#x27;re learning in this course.

I did not think I was going to like CS, really. I took this class because I thought it might be a useful skill and was curious to explore it&ndash; found it cool and might even pursue a secondary. BUT I did not sleep this semester because of CS50. At all. I had no background, some other work&ndash;demanding classes (my mistake)&ndash; but if you don&#x27;t have experience, make sure you are aware of the amount of time it will take you to learn everything on your own coming in to this. The course is designed to teach you to learn programming languages mostly by yourself&ndash; and this is what you&#x27;ll have to do. Much outside research is necessary&ndash; the skills&#x2F;commands needed for successfully completing assignments are never wholly covered during class times. The assignments are creative and fun, even, but they are so incredibly time consuming to get right. Points given for design are volatile and not always backed up,  so if you want to take the class graded (which I did and do not recommend unless you have the discipline&#x2F;interest&#x2F;background&#x2F;brain power) it&#x27;ll be even more difficult. The class is well&ndash;structured, don&#x27;t get me wrong, and TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SOCIAL OPPORTUNITIES (free weekly lunCH! IS! Great!). <br/>But I prioritized the assignments of this class over my health and that was a mistake.</td>

I would say just take it! See what you think of it. I had no, none, ZERO coding experience before this, and thought the class was fine. It was definitely really HARD at first (like I think I spent like 12 hours on pset 1 or 2) and I couldn&#x27;t really wrap my head around things, but it definitely got easier as the class went on, and it&#x27;s just really satisfying to see how far you came from the beginning of the class all the way to the end!! A bit of warning about pset 4, which was just hard and annoying, pset 8 the homepage one also just super long but not hard, and pset 9 (which was just unnecessarily long) which you NEED TO START EARLY and go to office hours or tutorials for. The test is kind of annoying and out of scope, but the final project is super doable and easy if you understood the last pset well. Go to tutorial if you have a bug in your code instead of trying to solve it by yourself like I did (and hence wasted many many many hours over). Save your late hours for the later psets (like 4 or 5 or later). Lab wasn&#x27;t too useful but GO TO SECTION!! Very helpful for understanding stuff from lecture.</td>

It will definitely be a lot of work but the course is set up to feel really rewarding, to build community, and to have something to take away and show people (namely your final project). The psets are fun and you are actually coding (which I hear you don’t do a lot of in subsequent clssses) <br/><br/>That said, if you have a significant background in CS (for example if you know OOP or you have taken the AP in high school) I might advise against it. In general, the class can feel really frustrating as it is very “performative”.  While David Malan is a great teacher, he is clearly working from a script and when he deviates from it, he occasionally messes up. You can hear all the camera operators talking throughout class and reminding you that the class is being streamed to hundreds of thousands of people. When people talk about meeting David or even Carter it’s like they are discussing a celebrity interaction rather than a teacher student relationship. Overall, the course can sometimes seem “fake”. The problem sets are fun but only around 3 are actually challenging and interesting. And while you can say when you join the course that you are “more comfortable” or do “more comfortable” psets, doing the harder psets doesn’t give you any extra points and saying you are more comfortable doesn’t mean you can go to less section, it just means you are graded on a harsher curve. <br/><br/>I liked taking CS50 in the sense that I was afraid that if I didn’t, some of my peers would know topics that I didn’t and I would feel behind. I think this class accomplished that goal. That said, I don’t know how much I actually learned considering I had a high school background in cs.</td>

I would highly caution someone considering taking this class, especially students who just want a basic coding introduction.

This means that creating a presentable product is often prioritized over your learning experience. For example, the lectures are over engineered to the point where they are often unhelpful; many of the problem sets are tedious; and you will be asked to do many things are that are wholly unnecessary (quizzes, forms after each problem, labs, etc.).<br/><br/>Furthermore, multiple TFs have complained about the class unprompted. Most of their complaints center around being overworked, being asked to do things that are completely pointless, and having to teach much of the material because David Malan&#x27;s lectures are never enough. <br/><br/>Overall, this class will not ruin your semester; it is not terribly difficult, and the support network is great. But you might be better served by other computer science classes that have fewer frills and focus on more tangible CS skills.</td>

I had initially not planned to take a CS class after CS50, but I am now planning to take more CS because I enjoyed CS50 so much. As far as advice, start the test immediately after it opens. This is not something that you want to wait until the last day to complete. The test is something that you can do well on if you allow yourself enough time, but it will be very tough otherwise, and the test will count for a large part of your grade. Also, go to tutorials!!! Tutorials are extremely, extremely helpful so that you 1) learn how to best approach the problem and 2) don&#x27;t spend hours trying to troubleshoot something or figure something out when you can get advice about where your thinking might be flawed. Finally, before you submit PSETs, I&#x27;d recommend reading over your code for stylistic changes. Also don&#x27;t forget that style50 exists. This will help with design score.</td>
