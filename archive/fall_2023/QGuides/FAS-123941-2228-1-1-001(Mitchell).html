It isn&#x27;t particularly kind, and the exams are treated as educational tools so that you can fine tune your studying for them by the third one, which is great in theory but leads to a lot of bad grades for the first exam, a lot of bad grades for the second exam, and ok grades for the third exam.  I didn&#x27;t even do badly in the course by any means, but it felt so unfortunate that grades became a big reason for a lot of people to stress about the exams instead of love learning the content.  I liked learning the concepts, but honestly it felt unkind.  Sections were fun, but they weren&#x27;t that helpful in the grading scheme of the class, which was nearly entirely exams.  If there had been psets or something to offset the weight of the exams, that would&#x27;ve been nice, but considering that most people I know were getting grades in the 70s or low 80s with no curve, it was tough.  Also they don&#x27;t release lecture recordings unless you really need it which was super inconvenient as someone who loved the lecture experience but was sick for 80% of the semester...why gatekeep the knowledge?</td>

The exams focus super heavily on lecture material, so you want&#x2F;need to go to all of the lectures to do well. The averages on the exams hover around 74&ndash;84% (84, for our year, being strangely high). This is an annoyingly low average given the difficulty level of the material, but it&#x27;s because they basically test on content retention of what was covered in lecture. Despite this, prof doesn&#x27;t appear to curve the class but tells you that your ~inevitably high score on the paper~ will bring your grade up to a B+. tldr; to do well, go to lecture, take gooood notes, do well on exams (by completing first two steps).</td>

I wish someone had told me this earlier instead of me wasting my time. Usually there&#x27;s only 1&ndash;2&#x2F;25 MCQ that are from the book and the entire free response is straight from lecture. Use the lecture slides. rewrite ur notes on whiteboards. &quot;Teach&quot; other people the lecture and you&#x27;ll do fine in the course. I mainly focused on the textbook and got a 77 on the first exam then I stopped and by the 3rd exam, I got a 98. Furthermore, there really isn&#x27;t that much value in the section but if you do your readings you&#x27;ll be fine. The class overall is interesting but it can feel daunting that your grades are 3 exams and a paper just push through it and you&#x27;ll do fine.</td>

My advice would be to allot a certain amount of time to doing the readings, and getting what you can out of that time. Thoroughly reading each chapter was a little bit too much for me.

My only warning would be the textbook readings. If you chose to do them, they are SO long and time&ndash;consuming. There was always a few questions on the exam that came directly from the textbook, and a few multiple choice questions on exams like these add up. That being said, you can definitely get away with not doing the readings. Would definitely recommend&ndash;great intro to psychology and not too much work besides readings.</td>

I will say it covers a lot of the content you need to know for the MCAT for all the premeds out there, so I think it&#x27;s good to take while studying for the MCAT because the content overlaps well. The midterms are alright. Definitely study for them, make sure you look back at the lecture slides and know the experiments, and definitely read the textbook. They ask about some pretty obscure details from the chapters sometimes, and I know they say rereading isn&#x27;t a good way to study, but honestly rereading&#x2F;skimming through the chapters and additional readings a couple days before the midterms actually worked out really well for me as I was more likely to remember small details from the textbook that they would ask about on exams. The exam questions are pretty fair. However, a lot of the questions are simply there to test whether you actually did the readings rather than testing your understanding of psychology, so make sure you actually read through the entire reading&#x2F;chapter, even though some of the information might not seem important&#x2F;relevant, because they might ask about a small detail that you&#x27;ll want to recognize as the right answer on the test. A little annoying, I know, but hopefully they&#x27;ll change that up. Midterms aren&#x27;t too bad overall though, and an A is definitely possible if you just put some work in. Overall a pretty interesting and not super awful class.</td>

Subject matter is generally pretty interesting and taught in an engaging way. I was always surprised by how low the exam averages were because the tests were honestly not that hard, I think the disproportionate amount of first years taking this class skewed that. Just read the textbook, go over the slides once or twice and you will be fine. I would recommend going to lecture even though attendance isn&#x27;t recorded because the lecture slides are pretty indecipherable if you weren&#x27;t there to hear them explained.</td>
