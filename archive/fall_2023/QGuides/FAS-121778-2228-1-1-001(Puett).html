The course did that for me. I was constantly reflecting on the lectures and trying to put into practice the concepts we were learning about in order to make myself a more thoughtful and grounded person in my personal and academic life. I feel genuinely more alive and more human after taking this course. I take deeper breaths, I stop to recognize that someone near me is having an &#x27;off&#x27; day, I am more forgiving of myself. I could go on and on. It also feels like an accomplishment to have read some of the most foundational texts of the classical chinese tradition. <br/><br/>TAKE THIS COURSE. Unless you NEED visuals during a lecture, please please do yourself a favor and take this course. It&#x27;s not a ton of weekly work, but yet you still demonstrate your understanding in a variety of ways. Without too much work, the course does exactly what a good education should do &ndash;&ndash; makes you a better person in the world without demanding busy work to reach that aim.<br/><br/>Michael Puett is gold on Harvard&#x27;s campus. Everyone should take a course with him during their Harvard career. He is brilliant, joyful, and energetic. His lecturing style worked very well for me personally as an auditory learner. It was also so lovely how all of his lectures built off of and specifically tied back to all of the previous lectures (instead of assuming that we always had time to re&ndash;orient ourselves and review material before class in the middle of week)!</td>

It&#x27;s so so so cool and thought provoking and chill and vibey and if you need to meet that ethics and civics requirement there is, in my humble opinion, literally no better way of doing that. A word of advice about the readings is that they Say a Lot of Things because they&#x27;re the seminal texts of whole philosophies so while you really have to go into them with an open mind and take everything in on its own terms, I also highly recommend having a little area of interest&#x2F;theme kicking around in the back of your mind so you can highlight it in a separate color or make notes about it so your essays become a BREEZE, no rereading required. It also makes the whole text a little less overwhelming. I mean, not that they&#x27;re really all that overwhelming, honestly they move at shockingly comfortable paces most of the time. But yeah, keep an open mind, but have a little pet topic that you&#x27;re keeping an eye on to help feel less out of your depth.<br/><br/>You see? I&#x27;m already giving advice on how to read the texts because I&#x27;m just assuming you&#x27;re already taking this class because why WOULDN&#x27;T you?

You should spend a good deal of time just thinking about what the text means in a context that is more than just the essays. Maybe even over a break, think about how you can cultivate yourself to be the best version of yourself. It will require a lot of conscious effort, and at times it might seem like it is a waste of time. But in time, you will begin to see improvements, and hopefully, all of that conscious thought will allow you to act without thinking once you have become more comfortable with things.</td>

Puett is a great lecturer (he is sooooo into it which makes the lectures really engaging), he makes the concepts really clear, and the philosophy aspect is so cool. The only wish I had taking this class is that we had more chances to engage with the material ourselves instead of just &quot;learning&quot; it. The essays will have you analyze the texts instead of asking what YOU think about them, if that makes sense. I don&#x27;t regret taking the class though, it was very enjoyable and I learned a lot. The other thing you should know is it is a pretty easy class. There&#x27;s a 4 page paper, a 6 page paper, and a final project (can be an 8 pager or a creative&#x2F;art&ndash;based project), and weekly readings, and that&#x27;s it!</td>
