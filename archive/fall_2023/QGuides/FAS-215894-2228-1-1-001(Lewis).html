The overall structure of the class is a little confusing and hard to follow, but each week has a solid theme that is interesting to read about and follow along with. It has four major assignments which aren’t too hard to complete, plus weekly commentary on readings in Slack. The readings aren’t bad and are usually easy to skim. The final project gives you a lot of freedom and can be fun if you find an interesting topic.</td>

It is a lot of work and will require you to spend a lot of time reading and analyzing complex historical documents, as well as thinking and writing about very broad prompts (that oftentimes are so broad that confining your writing to the word count is nearly impossible). The readings and films for this class are very enjoyable, and the structure of five slack responses is very manageable. Lectures and sections are not particularly involved and sometimes feel distantly related to the readings. There may be times where you question how one lecture relates to another. I really did like my TF and the thoughtful comments she gave regarding my work. With that said, the work can be extremely time&ndash;consuming, and sometimes the grading can feel particularly arbitrary. <br/><br/>The first assignment was a historical analysis paper, and the prompt felt extremely vague and open&ndash;ended. The midterm paper felt similarly vague. Although it was nice to be given some liberty, this vagueness and a lack of specific grading criteria often left me feeling unsatisfied by the time grades and feedback were provided. I probably spent a lot more time than others thinking about what to write and crafting it in such a way that would best communicate my reactions&#x2F;arguments. Keep in mind that even though this is a gen&ndash;ed, your work will be graded as if it is a course in the history department. Although an A is usually fairly achievable with a decent amount of work, high As feel extremely rare and difficult to obtain. The Berlin Wall memo took me a fairly long time to complete and required a decent amount of time thinking, planning, revising, and editing in Cabot Library through the wee hours of the morning. This assignment taught me that taking risks or presenting challenging&#x2F;nuanced arguments are not necessarily rewarded; you will be graded the same regardless. Finally, the final project, while fun, demands an immense amount of focus and dedication to be completed well. I was interested in map&ndash;making, so I chose to do a map for my final project, but learning how to use GIS is EXTREMELY difficult. DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE the amount of time required to gather even a basic understanding of GIS. It really is not easy. I would not recommend making a map if you are not entirely dedicated to producing a good one. <br/><br/>There are some very important ethical questions regarding borders that still linger in my mind. While this class does a more than adequate job of pointing out the ethical problems of certain borders, it does not offer possibly solutions or alternatives. This makes the ethical aspect of the class oftentimes feel swept under the rug. I would&#x27;ve loved to have more discussion about how borders might be altered in the future to correct ethical flaws. Instead, the course oftentimes felt like a historical survey of seemingly unconnected borders.</td>

Additionally, at times this class could move kind of slow and feel like a high school class. Professor Lewis is very endearing and passionate about the course, but I think the class would benefit from some engagement techniques that feel less forced. The assignments are not necessarily difficult, but there were some additional things that got added on for participation that were not mentioned in the syllabus, and I feel like they were not particularly useful (slack posts and then added stipulations for how they should be posted before section, etc.). Overall, this was a decent course, but I would not take it again if given the chance. Take this into consideration if you war thinking about the class.</td>

However, if you are looking for a class to give you a really broad geographic understanding of borders, this may not be the best option. There is a bit of a focus on the Western world, with a lot of time being spent in Europe and the United States. Also, if lectures are hard for you to sit through, this also may not be the best course since a large portion of it is the lecture component with a large amount of students in it.

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_320d1fbe-2422-4602-bb6f-83d36e2a0ce6">This course was a pedagogical catastrophe. I write this not out of spite but out of sadness and concern, disappointment at the gap between what this course promised to be and what it was. And I write this as someone who cares deeply about education, immigration, and history: If this course is not changed dramatically, it will produce poor historians, writers, and activists.<br/><br/>A list of major problems with this course:<br/><br/>1)	Ethics: Although this is supposed to be an ethics and civics gened, there were no ethical frameworks used or any meaningful ethics teaching. Every unit would go a little something like this: We would read about a border that contributed to some violence, the professor would imply heavily that borders = violence = bad, this would be reiterated in section discussion, and then we’d move on. This used truisms – borders exclude people! – to avoid meaningful ethical discussions: Is exclusion inherently violent or immoral? What are the relationships between violence and immorality? Can we generate axioms or a standardized set of ethical considerations when evaluating a particular border? I came into this course with experience in immigration protest and a strong belief in the need to abolish or at least heavily curtail borders. I thought I’d be asked to engage with other beliefs in order to test, bolster, and better communicate my own. In fact, the opposite happened. The course’s very obvious but tacit anti&ndash;borders orientation leaves its students utterly unprepared to have substantive, difficult conversations with people who believe in borders because the class never in good faith entertained those beliefs, and the ethical reasoning behind them. <br/>2)	History: This course jumped around in both space and time in a way that was disorienting and created shallow coverage.  We spent much of the time on Europe – World War I and the Cold War – and yet had almost zero historical context for those units. (This was related to siloed, out of context assignments, explained further below.) Without an ethical framework affording cohesion, the course needed historical momentum and narrative. Instead, it felt like we were randomly picking borders with next to no historical awareness – the plebiscites, for example – and the only unifying thread was Eurocentrism. I understand the impulse to start and end in the United States, but if this course wants to be global, it should be willing to spend more time afield – the Koreas, Africa post&ndash;colonization, etc.!<br/>3)	Assignments: The assignments were poorly constructed. The midterm in particular asked students to make an argument from six lines in an excel column. It was framed as a map exercise, but the map was essentially irrelevant; all the data came from those six lines. I got a near perfect score simply by reiterating the lecture on plebiscites, because there was zero other historical material from the class, and we weren’t allowed to even try to understand the historical context using outside material. The assignment implied the way to succeed was 1) restate exactly what the professor says; and 2) imply causation from correlation in the numbers. These are the opposite of the lessons students – especially young historians – should be learning. Similarly, with the final project: This isn’t 2015 anymore; podcasts are no longer new and creative. The course needs to either commit to having a creative final project that lets people draw on their creative skillsets, or have a final paper&#x2F;exam. This in&ndash;between is frustrating – it’s as much or more work than a paper, but not truly creative enough to let students think outside the box. <br/>4)	Technology: Almost half of the lectures were waylaid by technological failures that sucked up class time and impeded learning. Things like setting up subtitles on a video, using Google Earth, etc. would neutralize entire class activities and knock out 10&ndash;15 minutes of class time. Yes, technology can be finnicky, but not a single other professor I’ve had at Harvard has struggled to this extent, especially after the Zoom year, which afforded most teachers a basic level of technological competence. There are basic technological skills all instructors should have mastered by now.<br/>5)	Fraught lectures: Sensitive, politically complex discussions should be led by experts: We should not be learning about issues as fraught as Israel&ndash;Palestine from someone unequipped to facilitate deep conversations. This unit alone was shockingly mishandled. First, we spent an entire class watching a documentary with no context – a documentary that was flagrantly propagandistic, playing machine gun and bomb noises whenever Jewish sources spoke. After the documentary, we had time for exactly two questions: One student in the class asked “how the Jews got their weapons,” to which the professor responded “I don’t know.” !!! Another student asked who made the movie, to which the professor also responded that she wasn’t sure. Beyond the obvious pedagogical neglect inherent in showing a movie without knowing its sourcing, it was devastating to hear absolutely zero response to a basic question about the conflict (phrased in a way that definitely demanded unpacking!) The next lecture featured some ex post facto attempts to clean up the mess, which seemed shoehorned in, given how much the class ran over. Anyways, the damage was done. I think the unit was indicative of a bigger flaw in the current gened system, which allows professors who are experts in other fields to each tenuously related subjects as pet projects. The professor told us she taught this class because she felt she had to after Trump era border separation. I’m sympathetic to this political starting point, but not the fact that it emboldened her to claim expertise she doesn’t have on regions and issues that matter a great deal to a lot of people. Perhaps a co&ndash;professor would go a long way. <br/>6)	Resistance to feedback: Earlier in the course, I submitted versions of these complaints via the anonymous feedback form. At the start of the next class, the professor summarily entertained them and dismissed them, in a way that made clear the point of the form was not to modify the course at all, but to reactionarily defend its decisions. Similarly, in the last lecture, we were told to be nice in our Q guide reviews, lest we hinder the teaching careers of our TFs. Do you all not understand that this defeats the purpose of the Q guide? Not to mention how condescending and educationally bankrupt it is. Both the mid&ndash;semester feedback form and the Q&ndash;Guide recognize that students may have legitimate issues with the way a course is being taught. The correct response to this is not to either ignore that feedback or preemptively shape it. The correct response is to LISTEN to the students. <br/>7)	Attention: Many lectures started with or included a plea for students to not be distracted. Yes, technology and the pandemic have had a deleterious effect on attention spans and attitudes toward learning. But there’s a reason why we were bored! The lectures lacked cohesion or a driving principle; they felt like a random dissemination of information with weak gestures towards analysis (see the ethics point.) Attention is earned. If more than half your class is either not showing up or doing other work during class, that should be some indication that the class needs to be doing more. <br/><br/>In sum, please do not take this course – especially if you are a freshman. It will prepare you poorly for later history courses, ethics courses, and courses that require writing. Upperclassmen – take this course only if you need a gem.</td>
