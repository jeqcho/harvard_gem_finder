The structure of the course is pretty relaxed and allows for a deeper appreciation for the content without the constant stress of grades. The order of topics covered in this course is very cohesive. We began with topics related to social issues more broadly, learned about VC, and finally bridged the gap via guest lectures on how to actually apply VC to solve social issues. Prof. Fryer also does a great job of explaining very complicated concepts in simple ways as well as emphasizing the important parts of our readings in lecture. He generates a lot of enthusiasm for the topic of investing in a socially&ndash;conscious manner, and it is very clear he has a deep&ndash;rooted passion for helping society.</td>

I also did 0 work for the course except for a couple of readings and then doing 6&ndash;8 hours of work the week of the midterm and the final project. Professor Fryer is the most engaging professor here and his lectures were incredibly interesting.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Our grade was 1&#x2F;3 participation (although it was never ever taken), 1&#x2F;3 midterm exam and 1&#x2F;3 final project. <br/><br/>The midterm exam was by far the worst I have ever encountered. We had the date of the exam change DAYS before it was supposed to be taken. We weren&#x27;t allowed an open book but it was going to be online during the Saturday of Head of the Charles, then it was cancelled and rescheduled, then the times and venue were changed and AT NO POINT were we given a proper breakdown of what to study or how to prepare. There was no practice exams, no practice problems, and no solutions to examples in the textbook we were supposed to use. Every single student felt cheated or screwed over by this exam. 50% of the midterm was dependent on problem set type questions on VCs we had never practiced and only covered in one example in class and the practice in the textbook had no solution set.<br/><br/>The final project was also a mess. We were told about it in the beginning of the semester but we would only be given the actual assignment with 2 weeks left of classes... In classes where your final project is an innovative entrepreneurial venture you work on it for the entire semester with small check&ndash;in assignments biweekly to encourage progress and feedback. Here we got the final assignment with 2 weeks left with no grading guidelines and no chance for iteration and improvement. <br/><br/>Lastly, you know how bad it must be for the Economics department to send everyone in the course an email in the beginning of November saying we hear your concerns and everyone will be allowed to change the course to pass&#x2F;fail until the very last day of classes... That has never happened and probably will never happen but because of the incredible disorganization their hand was forced.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I would actively discourage anyone from taking this course. Unless severe changes are made in terms of assignments, addition of sections, and better course planning I would never recommend people take this course. I want to make it clear that Roland the person is incredible. He is caring, patient, vulnerable, and endlessly interesting. I had many conversations with him that I really enjoyed but in terms of organization this course left much to be desired.</td>

Further, grades are reported to be determined based on &quot;participation,&quot; the aforementioned midterm, and final. &quot;Participation&quot; consisted of once (out of all the classes across the entire semester), loose leaf paper being passed throughout the art museum lecture hall, for us to sign in on. Did that ever get back to Professor Fryer, or anyone in charge? No idea because no grades are put into canvas. The final, a business plan slide deck and a 2min and 5 slide pitch was equally unorganized. My group emailed multiple times trying to meet to discuss ideas with no response. Further, presentations went 10&ndash;15 minutes with 15+ slides, with Professor Fryer interrupting and going on tangents. Given all of this, the undergrad economics decided to allow students to take the class pass fail up until dec 1, with no further action. Do not take this class.</td>

I was taking this class for a letter grade and then dropped it for a pass&#x2F;fail when the registrar&#x27;s office emailed us saying we could take it pass&#x2F;fail even after the deadline until he very last day of classes without even letting the course staff know. The class was horribly conducted.</td>

There are no homework assignments so all the pressure is on that one midterm and the final project (which had very few details about how it&#x27;d be graded). I took this class with the intention of it being my easiest class of the semester, and it was, but at the cost of my sanity, which I lost for many weeks. So if you&#x27;re willing to take a gamble with this class and be exposed to some interesting material, albeit without any knowledge at all of how well you&#x27;ll do at the end of the semester, then go for it; otherwise, there are better classes out there.</td>

There is no coordination within the structure of the class at all and he does not have TFs which is cool until you realize that it&#x27;s just him and his assistant running the show.   I think that the class structure will change a lot which is probably for the better.  If you have a genuine interest in venture capital and social issues then yes you should take this class and I think if you can either look past the terrible organization and&#x2F;or the organization has been changed you will get a lot out of the class.</td>

The first few weeks leading up to the midterm are engaging and I would say the lectures overall are the saving grace of the class. I enjoyed the content of the class but I wish I derived more out of it but there was very little focus on VCs. There were no sections, participation was arbitrarily graded.  The midterm was pushed 3 times before actually happening and we weren&#x27;t sure of the mode of assessment till 2 days before the class. There were no practice tests, no guidance whatsoever. The midterm was the most awful test I have taken at this institution with the greatest lack of structure covering content we had NEVER talked about in class for one entire half of the test. In an already tough semester (academically and otherwise) this class made it all worse for me. I was excited to go to class and hear about Prof Fryer&#x27;s research but after the midterm I lost all motivation. Very sad that this class was not what I hoped for it to be and wish there were classes on topics as unique as this one at Harvard.</td>

I was pumped about taking the course after reading the description but it sorely disappointed. The first half of the class is about Roland and his peers&#x27; research into injustice and discrimination in America. I respect their work and thought it was decently interesting, just be prepared that this is half the class and the midterm asks a ton of nitty gritty questions from deep in the readings. The second half of the class is about &quot;VC&quot; , and if you know absolutely nothing about the structure &#x2F; functionality of VC &#x2F; PE firms and are interested, it may help you connect some dots about how it works. If you already know a decent amount about that stuff, you won&#x27;t learn anything new or interesting most likely. While I am really interested in VC &#x2F; PE, the course is fully, 100% focused on IMPACT investing. So be prepared... I just personally think a lot of it is BS and I&#x27;d rather spend my time learning about how to actually make money and develop pure investment IQ and then hopefully use that to help people. That is just me though, if you are very interested in helping people over making returns, check this class out. The final is fun if you think of an idea you care about, but it&#x27;s basically just a long pitch deck on a company you make up that has to be economically profitable AND have a social impact. <br/><br/>The actual content of the class is not horrible by any means, but Roland and Jamina are horrible at managing this class. Our midterm format changed like 3 times and also neither of them ever respond &#x2F; are helpful over email. <br/><br/>Grade wise I think it is a tough class to get an A in. Will have to work pretty hard on the midterm and final for an A&ndash;, B+ is pretty do&ndash;able if you are somewhat competent. <br/><br/>Overall, it&#x27;s aight. Not the worst class ever, but probably not as good as what you&#x27;re imagining it to be.</td>

Throughout the semester, my fellow students have labeled it as a joke. Ec 1021 is a non&ndash;coherent jumble of a bit of Ec 50&ndash;style social science with a crash course in VC accounting. While the goal of the course (explaining how social ills can be solved with private markets) is admirable, the actual content of the course does nothing in that vein. Ec 1021&#x27;s central premise is that students should endeavor to create companies whose product&#x2F;service is something that solves a social problem, or to invest in companies that do. However, this course only offers buzzwords that sound smart until you think about them for two seconds and realize how empty and devoid of meaning they are. The midterm felt like it was put together haphazardly: it was rescheduled last&ndash;minute, the TFs were hired from outside the course and had no clue about course material, one of the answer choices was literally blank text, one of the problems had no correct answer, everyone&#x27;s grades were mysteriously curved after the exam with no explanation of why or how, etc. <br/><br/>Even though I found this class quite easy, light on workload (1 hour per week, if at all), and I did well in terms of grades, it was one of the least enjoyable classes I&#x27;ve taken in my 7 semesters at Harvard. I can&#x27;t help but think that Harvard is wasting thousands of hours of undergraduate student time and potential by offering this course. DO NOT TAKE.</td>

On top of that, it was rescheduled, they provided little flexibility for the people with other commitments, and I had to cancel a job interview for that. It honestly felt extremely disrespectful from the part of the professor to change the format so drastically, and the rules so many times.<br/><br/>And for the final project, no one really understands what you need to do to get a good grade because the instructions are very unclear.
