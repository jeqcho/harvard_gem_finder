Roughly 10 hours a week on average outside of class. Especially the first half of the course will take a lot of time, like up to 15 hours. Office hours are perennially packed so expect it to take a long time to get guidance on problem sets (and I did not find them particularly helpful), and understanding will require collaboration with other students. The professors recommend coming to class and make it feel somewhat required in the beginning, but watching lecture recordings is also fine. It may feel extremely frustrating and annoying, particularly the tediousness of some lecture topics, problems, and psets, though I am only gradually realizing that I did learn substantially through the course. The professors are always looking to improve the course, more so than many others, and deeply value feedback which is always appreciated. The lectures are often dense and difficult to understand, but for an algorithms course, CS 120 is a decent course to take. As I have said throughout the course, A for effort, C for execution.</td>

The class could improve greatly in terms of having more engaging lectures. Also need more practice problems for the final because there were very few available which made studying very hard. The better you are at math the easier this class will be as it doesn&#x27;t actually test any real DSA applicable knowledge but just tests how good you are at abstracting problems away in a general sense. If you&#x27;re looking for a class to help you with leetcode and software interview prep, this isn&#x27;t it. I don&#x27;t feel any more prepared for those interviews after taking this class. However, that doesn&#x27;t mean the class isn&#x27;t worth taking. I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s still worth it for the intellectual stimulation you receive from abstracting away algorithms and thinking more mathematically.</td>

They will not contribute to your learning, but you will spend energy and time on them. Thankfully, writing a participation portfolio is not a lot of time.<br/><br/>The exams are not easy. They require you to have a very good grip on all topics covered in class, and they are closed&ndash;book with no notes allowed. You have to remember a lot, so start reviewing the material early. You should expect to spend at least 1 full day studying for the midterm, and at least 2&ndash;3 full days studying for the final.<br/><br/>Problem sets are of moderate difficulty. Sections and office hours are a good resource, and there are a lot of time slots for these, so it&#x27;s easy to get help. The late day policy is also generous; you likely won&#x27;t have to worry about deadlines.<br/><br/>Knowing how to write proofs is an absolute must. The course provides some basic introduction to writing proofs, but it&#x27;s not nearly enough if you have no prior experience. You should also know some basic Python for the coding portion of problem sets.<br/><br/>Overall, the class is not great and it&#x27;s still being polished.

However, the grading on the proofs submitted for problem sets can sometimes be a bit too nitpicky, which gets kind of annoying when you understand a problem but still get marked off for stuff you forgot to explicitly describe.</td>

Go to section, go to office hours, watch lecture. Class has a few bumps, but it&#x27;s developing well for its 2nd year being a class. If Patrick, Andrew, or Phevos are still apart of the teaching staff definitely attend their office hours and one of their sections.</td>

The lectures are generally very solid, and the course also provides some very useful, detailed lecture notes. The psets are interesting and not too hard, but also not too easy. There is a lot of support in terms of office hours and people ready to answer your Ed questions. Exams were very fair. Also, grading for this class was really low&ndash;stress , which made it so much more enjoyable for me. I really liked the variety of topics, and I feel like I took away a good amount of information from the class. Would totally recommend taking it!</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_2c0add23-c050-4d76-80c2-c01aaf7ad88d">I hope they change the grading system. It was on a &#x27;revision&#x27; system where you could revise mistakes on assignments. Sounds good, but it made it feel like the only thing distinguishing student grades were the assessments, and made my grade ambiguous for the entire semester. At times I didn&#x27;t really know what the assignments were teaching me or how it was supposed to help me in the future. Both professors were very willing to help us understand the content if we had any challenges, which was nice.</td>

The course is still a little shakey since it is new, but TFs and the professors are doing amazing on fleshing out all the details. The material also helps for technical interviews! Note, the first two PSETS this year were the most difficult (especially since we might not be as acquainted with the proof PSET style), so don&#x27;t let it through off your expectations for the rest of the course. It gets easier :). Definitely a recommend in the theory CS category.</td>

I did not take CS20 or any proof centered math courses so I had to self study to get caught up with the courses material. I would recommend taking this course without the proper background only if your other courses will be light . After the first few weeks I think you will get a feel of what the staff wants from the proofs. In my experience the proofs can be a little hand&ndash;wavy sometimes but they are graded based on conceptual understanding more then technical understanding of proof structure. Overall a great course, participation portfolios are a little hard to understand though!</td>

If you&#x27;ve never taken a proof&ndash;based math class beyond geometry, either do some serious self&ndash;study or take CS20. Anybody who&#x27;s done Math 22 or above would be totally chillin</td>

The PSET grading structure ensured that I learned all of the important concepts without being too stressed. That being said, it is still a difficult course, and you should expect to get conceptually lost every once in a while. The large number of students made it easier to find people to communicate with about the course topics and ensure I understood everything by the time the course ended.</td>

I spent an unreasonable amount of time on the psets because it was never clear what I had to prove and points were deducted for lots of reasons. The N&#x2F;L&#x2F;R&ndash;&#x2F;R&#x2F;R+ grading scheme is quite annoying (not solving 1 question out of 3 gives you an L or incomplete although that would have been a 66% in a normal class). I have learned a lot of things in this class but the experience was quite painful (I got 5&#x2F;6 regrade requests approved). Lectures are often confusing but lecture notes are great. Liked Salil more than Adam. Exams are generally fair but grading can be harsh. I will probably get a good grade but this has been one the most stressful classes that I have taken at H.</td>

As a math person who had a few CS classes under my belt it felt very approachable, and not truly difficult until the last few subjects which were more outside my wheelhouse. A strong understanding of proof writing is the most valuable skill to bring in. The resources which are offered by the course staff are greater than that of any other class I&#x27;ve ever taken; between the multitude of available office hours slots, the different sections aimed at students with different background and interests, and the ample opportunities to make up missed points on assignments, I really admire what the staff did to encourage learning. I would not expect this be an &quot;easier version of CS 124&quot;, which is kind of what I thought it would be coming in; the topics covered are quite different, and there is actually not that much time spent discussing algorithms. But everything being discussed was presented well and is worth learning.</td>
