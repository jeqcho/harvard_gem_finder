The topics are extremely interesting, the work is minimal (mainly textbook readings, which are engaging, and then 1 pset each week), and the professors and TFs are great. There is also a lot of support in terms of grading, i.e. they really do everything in their power for you to NOT fail. Your lowest scores in certain categories are dropped, and you earn extra credit for doing practice midterms and finals no matter your score. There are also corrections on psets, which not every introductory course has. Definitely a must&ndash;take in some point in your Harvard career.</td>

You have to separate time every week to do the PSETs (which are not very long, but the lecture doesn&#x27;t prepare you to tackle the questions I felt, so it requires a bit of struggling to find out how to do it), and do some other fairly easy assignments such as 500&ndash;word essays, small debate, etc. You do have to take time to study for the midterm and final, though, since it&#x27;s a lot of content to cover.  But apart from that, you can dedicate as much as you want, basically. Some people go to every in&ndash;person lecture, PSET collab section, in&ndash;person review sessions, special events, office hours, etc. I wasn&#x27;t this connected with course, but you can make your way in it as you prefer. You can make it a relaxed course and then cram for 4 days for the final. It works. <br/>&ndash; Pro&#x2F;grow (connection with the content): Sometimes the content seemed boring&#x2F;superficial to me, but after the end of the semester (and studying for the final exam), being able to look back in perspective, I feel like I learned interesting and useful things. It&#x27;s less of a critical space than I wanted to investigate the assumptions, though, but taking it in my first semester was helpful to have this view towards my other classes and allow me to have more perspective into my interest in econ. <br/>&ndash; Grow (environment): Personally the environment wasn&#x27;t very intellectually stimulating for me. People are not actively present in sections, you hear everything in the whole econ major stereotype such as advocacy for legal organ selling, etc. If these are your type of people you can perhaps feel more connected than I did.  It&#x27;s good though that it&#x27;s a big first&ndash;year class, so there&#x27;s all the adrenaline of entering Sanders for the first lecture, etc. <br/>&ndash; Pro (material): There&#x27;s a lot of material to study from. It&#x27;s very self&ndash;explanatory. There&#x27;s also lots of help. The course is very well structured. <br/>Overall, I don&#x27;t regret taking at all! If you&#x27;re more interested in it than I was, you might love it, since I already liked it a lot!</td>

The instructors stress that the course is aimed at providing a &quot;conceptual&quot; understanding of Economics. Even then, they will make it as easy as possible (many questions in the final were literally copy&ndash;pasted from the practice exams, and nearly all of them replicated problems that we&#x27;d already encountered). If you&#x27;re looking for a rigorous introduction to higher&ndash;level economics, then this course is not for you. The lack of math is at times frustrating (you often feel so close to having a definitive solution of a model, but the instructors will only give you a qualitative hint). Consider taking 1010a instead (one downside of that is that you won&#x27;t be able to take the 1011 series for credit), or 1011 you you already have the math prereqs.<br/>On the other hand, if you&#x27;ve never studied economics before (in school or by yourself), this course will be interesting. It provides a great framework for thinking in economic terms and approaching public&ndash;policy questions. Overall, you&#x27;ll come out of this course better equipped to deal with political and economic current events issues, which is the main upside of the course.<br/>Also, the instructors are great!

For all assignments, office hours with your section leader and the PSET collaboration sessions on Sunday are really helpful in finishing the PSET. Also, I really recommend forming a study group to finish the PSETS and study for the exams. Overall, the teaching staff was great and there are extensive resources to practice and learn the material.

I think that the class really opens your eyes to how the world works beyond just economics and the approach they take changes the way you think about everything from day to day decisions to public policy. It does a great job at exposing you to economics research (and whether or not you actually want to do it). I also think you get as much out of it as you put in and there are so many opportunities to meet world class researchers.<br/><br/>For psets, just go to the Collab Sessions. It cuts down the time in half and you can also get all of the answers. Only the first half of the course is really from AP Micro, the rest is all new and very policy focused. If you read the textbook and go through the lecture slides, you don&#x27;t really have to watch the lectures or go to them (most people end up not going by the third week). Also, a significant portion of the grade is multiple choice tests. The class has a lot of built in structure so don&#x27;t be afraid to take advantage of it.

You learn the same material from a lot of different perspectives which gives you a thorough knowledge of the subject.  Once you learn a topic from the lectures, your knowledge is strengthened not only with sections and problem sets but also with Unit Review Programs Economics in Action Seminars, and essays. Unit Review Programs give you a chance to revisit learned topics in every 3 weeks, and if there’s anything you don’t remember well, you can briefly go over it with a tutor. As for the Economics in Action Seminars, they give you an opportunity to hear from various accomplished professors how the economic principles you learned are used in real life. Essays you write make you explain the technical material in non&ndash;technical terms and real&ndash;life examples – just like a non&ndash;economist would understand; this is very helpful because explaining and teaching deepen your understanding even more. In short, Ec10a’s main goal is to make a student learn – not to test them. This makes it my favorite course of the term.</td>

Don’t feel scared if you cannot do all of the readings. They are useful but not very necessary to understand the lecture. However, if you don’t understand smth in the lecture, turn back to readings. Don’t hesitate to reach David Martin (head tf) in any condition. He is so understanding and accessible. Anytime you feel lost about the class, he should be the person to talk about it. Debate is fun, they just want to see you put effort in preparation. Essays are also fun to write and my tf was not that harsh in grading (unfortunately very tf dependent experience). Depending on who you section leader is sections can be very useful or unnecessary. Don’t try to cram for the exams on last day, it doesn’t work. More importantly, try to understand the material as it helps you to understand market and people behaviors better. David and Jason are amazing professors. I found Jason’s lectures harder but probably contend related issue. Overall, an amazing class to start your college experience.

You take out as much as you put in, so I&#x27;d say go to the lectures (they start getting empty as the semester goes on) and read the textbook. For the final&#x2F;midterms, they are very similar to the practice tests they give us, so redo those 100 times (testing is pretty fair. try to keep up with the topics and don&#x27;t cram weeks worth of material the day before). <br/>It is a pretty solid class, very organized despite its huge size, and a capstone of the Harvard experience (the best economics department in the world!)!!!</td>

You learn a lot of cool things at a **descriptive** level. This means that you mostly don&#x27;t learn the math behind things, except at a really basic level. If you care about math and other technicalities, you should not take Econ 10a.<br/><br/>You will be required to purchase a textbook. Even if you have it already as a hard copy or as an ebook, you will still be required to purchase it and there is no way around it.<br/><br/>The problem sets are short and don&#x27;t require a lot of time. The course staff organizes collab sessions for problem sets, but you won&#x27;t need these, it&#x27;s usually enough to ask your TF.<br/><br/>The class has a lot of readings, but you can mostly get away without doing any of them. Some people found the exercises in the textbook to help with problem sets and&#x2F;or reinforcing concepts. Indeed, a subset of questions on problem sets seems to be drawn from the pool of textbook exercises.<br/><br/>The class has many, many, many different types of assignments. You will have to do problem sets, pre&ndash;lecture activities, two short essays, a debate, Unit Review Programs, Economics in Action reflections, and two exams. Most of these are short, but they are still there, and they can get annoying. Be prepared for this.<br/><br/>The exams are not easy, regardless of your background. Both the midterm and the final are long, multiple&ndash;choice exams, where questions test understanding of subtle topics. You really need an in&ndash;depth understanding to do well. Make sure to do all practice exams when studying; the types of questions are recycled. The midterm is a bit harder than the final because each questions is weighted more; make 3 mistakes on the midterm and you&#x27;re down to 90% already. A cheat sheet is allowed for both exams, but be cautious about how useful the cheat sheet actually is. It&#x27;s probably a good idea to put some information on it, but for most questions it might not be that helpful.<br/><br/>Overall, even though the material is very easy, it&#x27;s also easy to slip up and not get an A, especially because the exams carry a lot of weight. Make sure you understand the grade risk before taking Econ 10a and do NOT underestimate it.<br/><br/>Finally, I think it&#x27;s good to clarify what Econ 10a is about. You will NOT learn: what to do with money, how finance works, what should policy do. You WILL learn: why it is not clear what the tax rate should be, why increasing the minimum wage could either increase or decrease unemployment, why carbon tax is always a good thing. If these things sound appealing and you are willing to deal with the assignments, then take Econ 10a.</td>

However, you do need to put in the work throughout the entire semester, but it is really an incredibly manageable amount of work. Just read the textbook, go to every class, take notes, do every assignment, do practice exams before the midterm and final, and you will be fine!</td>

It’s a great introduction to how economists think and a super useful lens to have. The exams are fair game and it’s not hard to do well on the class if you do the psets&#x2F;practice exams.

Go to lecture so you don&#x27;t have to make them up later and try to do the readings before lecture. You&#x27;ll get much more out of them if you&#x27;ve already had an introduction to the topic. In general, use the textbook. It&#x27;s a totally underutilized resource and just reading it over is super helpful for studying for the midterms and finals. That said, your most important resource is the practice tests for the midterm and final which are the biggest portions of your final grade. Do them and you should be fine if you have a solid handle on the material. Also, take advantage of the outside of class opportunities. Go to the lunches and meet the speakers that come in, they&#x27;re super knowledgable and normally wouldn&#x27;t care about random undergrads so make use of it!</td>

You can sign up for lunches with the professors, which are great opportunities to learn more about them outside the classroom as well as economics in general. It&#x27;s a great setting where you don&#x27;t have to come in knowing anything about economics&ndash;&ndash;participating in lectures and section is really rewarding. It&#x27;s not an extremely difficult course, and everything is recorded, which makes it a flexible course to take if you want to just try out economics to see if you like it. I&#x27;m really excited about economics after taking this class and can&#x27;t wait to take more courses. The way they teach it and the Economics in Action seminars got me interested in pursuing research and careers involving economics. The textbook is a great resource as well for studying.

From what I have gathered from peers, if you do not come in with this background, it can still be easy or it can be a bit of a challenge. If in the latter category, take advantage of the resources offered, including office hours and actually reading the textbook, and collaborate on psets. The workload is very manageable&ndash;&ndash;mostly just the weekly psets, usually half multiple choice and half written, and the occasional essay (2) or debate preparation (1). When it comes to exams, be sure to attend the section class dedicated to reviewing for it, as well as the doing practice exams and attending office hours.  Finally, use the Unit Review Program to gauge your understanding. It is a really effective way to find gaps in your knowledge as you are still learning the material, rather than right before exams. Take it seriously, rather than just trying to get credit for completion, and ask the tutors questions (for reference, the Unit Review Program is where you go and take a unit practice exam of sorts, pass&#x2F;fail, that is graded and reviewed with you by an upperclassmen tutor). I would not say the class is always super engaging, but there are definitely things that even non&ndash;econ concentrators can find interesting (especially the Economics in Action seminars where other Harvard faculty share their research).</td>

The problem sets can sometimes be dull and have unclear wordings that delay your progress, and at least for me, did not feel like they were worth the effort I put into them. I do concede that the class can be a good introduction to anyone who has no economic background whatsoever and that the grading on assignments is very generous (two free drops on problem sets, one free missed section, etc.), but if you are up to taking harder, more intricate courses, I would definitely recommend not taking Ec10a (unless you are required to take it).</td>

Also, the lectures cover more theoretical concepts and practice problems so you necessarily need to to go to office hours or collab sessions to understand and do the PSETs.  It says that you have to do the readings, it is true that they can be helpful, but in most cases the lectures fully cover them again. Also, one thing that I didn&#x27;t like about this course is how the midterm and final mainly don&#x27;t really test your understanding of things, rather if you know the tricks, kind of like the SAT.
