My experience in this course was positive, and I&#x27;d recommend it to others.  For those debating through LPSA vs LS1A, I&#x27;d recommend LPSA for most students.  This course provided a super solid background for both Chem and Bio, and I had many friends who took LS1A and regretted it just a few weeks in.  LPSA serves as the same pre&ndash;rec as LS1A, but LPSA is broken down into dinner detail, and is thus more accessible to people with a broader academic background.  The tests are hard, but not designed to trick you if you studied appropriately.  I&#x27;d say that this course will be a journey for students who take it (with major ups and downs), but the journey is worth it in the end if you&#x27;re interested in the life sciences or working in medicine.  The professors did a great job of being available for students and making lecture as engaging as they could (although a 9am lecture will only ever be so engaging).</td>

However, the chemistry is so well&ndash;taught, the lectures are entertaining, and there is so much help for you to access. The equations you have to memorize may seem excessive at points, but once you do a couple of problems using the equations, memorizing them is not hard at all. The biology is kind of sped through at times, so I&#x27;d recommend LPS A specifically for students with strong biology backgrounds and weaker chemistry backgrounds. If you can get Joe as your TF please do, he is by far the most helpful person I&#x27;ve met at Harvard so far and he does so much to help you. Some people found LPS A quite hard, but you will be more than fine if you use the practice material given to you and go to office hours. Plus, LPS A was not graded on a curve, so your grade will be exactly what you earn and you will not have to fight to be at the top of the grade distribution.</td>

Class meets three times a week, has a weekly section, and a lab (meeting times vary throughout the semester). In regard to assignments, there are weekly PSETS, lab reports, 3 unit exams, and a final exam. The PSETs can be long, so I strongly recommend attending office hours, help rooms, and forming a study group. The exams are very cumulative with a lot of memorization (especially the chem exams since they do not provide formula sheets).

It not a lot of work at all. One pset a week and sometimes a pre&ndash;lab. The instructors are very nice and energetic. The enthusiasm Gregg has is contagious. It&#x27;s a 9 am class, but he will keep you alert with his teaching style. If you are in between LPS A and LS1a, I think LPS A gives a wider general scope for chemistry. There were stuff that we learned that LS1a didn&#x27;t have, like acids or bases. LS1a has more bio I would say and there are specific bio readings that give a deep dive. I think it just depends on what you like. I know some people may have this fear that LPS A is like a lesser version of LS1a, but the truth is that the classes just go about things a bit differently. Both get you to the same destination: LS1b, so there is no need to fret. If you keep up with the work and the lecture, you will have no problem.<br/><br/>I think how well section is depends on who the student has as their section TF. I had Jolade. She doesn&#x27;t always give the best explanations. Sometimes, they end with &quot;if that makes sense&quot; or &quot;that&#x27;s just how it is&quot; or &quot;you know what I mean,&quot; but there were significantly less of those as we went through the semester. By the end of the semester, we were able to go through all of the section questions and have some times afterwards. Things just got a lot more efficient. Tbh, she had a bit of a rough start, but I think she adjusted to her role pretty well after the first three weeks. She saw how much time we have allotted for section and utilizes that time well; she just needed to get a feel for it first. Also, ultra special note: people in my section were weirdly rude to her?!?! Like super demanding or very alpha behavior? They talked over her and jump the gun in all of her explanations and then afterwards be like she didn&#x27;t explain it well. Like duh, maybe if you tried to listen to her first, you would have gotten a more comprehensive understanding. I know these foundational courses are made up of premeds but like sometimes people just need a chill pill. My section only had a few people like that but they indeed have a very dominant presence. <br/><br/>I love this class. I literally only have one other gripe about this class. I wish this class was a little bit more lenient about submission stuff. We have to submit things to the canvas, and sometimes we need to embed a picture of something. One time, I did that, but because it didn&#x27;t go through for some reason with canvas, I was docked off a number of points out of my prelab which is out of 10 points. I know people who got zeros or points off on psets, not because they didn&#x27;t do them, but because when they submitted, they didn&#x27;t submit the cover page. I think that completely rejects a student&#x27;s hard work. Sure, it makes the grader have to search for the problem or what not because the page numbers are now skewed without the cover page. However, a pset can be like 4&ndash;5 hours of hard work, but because of a single cover page, that literally does not have any question on it, they get a zero? That&#x27;s inappropriate to say the least.  You would think a class is more about a student&#x27;s understanding and not some weird bureaucratic procedure that can throw everything else out of the window. I know my other pset classes did this thing where on Gradescope, the submitter can assign the question to the page. That literally solves everything.  No page numbers are skewed cuz of a cover page. sheesh</td>

LPSA is a phenomenal introductory course to chemistry and biology, which everyone should take regardless of their background in these subjects. Coming into this class with only knowledge from AP Biology, I initially felt overwhelmed with the amount of chemistry I was learning, but with time I became accustomed to the workload and looked at science in a way I never did before. It is important to note that this course is not heavy on memorization (even though it may seem like it at times) instead, it teaches you how to apply the knowledge from class to word problems and questions you might encounter in a scientific setting.<br/><br/> The layout of the course consists of three lectures (MWF 9:00 am&ndash;10:15 am), a section (1 hour and 15 min long), and a lab component (3 hours max although most labs only take 1 hour). There is one PSET due each week on Monday at 9:00 am, a pre&ndash;lab quiz due on Monday at 9:00 am, and a lab report due on Friday at 9:00 am. This all may seem daunting but to be honest, the workload is VERY manageable. There are three exams and a final exam and I can&#x27;t stress this enough but DO ALL THE PRACTICE EXAMS. The tests are very fair and if you do the practice exams you will know what to expect since they are of the same format. They host review sessions every week before the exam and have a multitude of help rooms you should attend. <br/><br/>The course for the most part is chemistry (2&#x2F;3 of the course) and then switches to biology (1&#x2F;3 of the course) at the end. Both Dr. Tucci and Dr. Matchacheep interchange, so one will teach a few lessons, and then the other will take over for some time. <br/><br/>Dr. Tucci: <br/><br/>&ndash;He is an enthusiastic man that makes this 9 a.m worth waking up for because he brings so much energy into the room. <br/>&ndash;He always encourages you to shout out your questions and will take time to answer them! <br/>&ndash; He tries his best to get to know you personally and will always greet you in the morning. <br/>&ndash;He holds one on one meetings that you can sign up for if you have any questions that aren&#x27;t answered in class or after class. These are short thirty&ndash;minute sessions but he tries his best to get through everything that confuses you. <br/><br/>Dr. Matchacheep: <br/><br/>&ndash;Many people often approach Dr. Tucci for questions, but Dr. Matchacheep is always there to answer questions as well. Both are chemists and are knowledgeable in their own domains (fun fact she also teaches organic chemistry in the summer, so if you have questions regarding chemical interactions this is your woman!) <br/>&ndash;She will walk you through all questions you have and will always make it very interactive. She works each question step by step with you. <br/>&ndash;She is also willing to meet with you in person to explain concepts you might have not grasped (I spent an entire hour with her reviewing problems until I finally got them) <br/>&ndash;She walks around the lecture during learning catalytic questions, so even if you are sitting in the back you are able to ask any question you have.<br/>&ndash;She is very kind&ndash;hearted and will always respond to your emails with kindness, so please approach her! <br/><br/><br/>Both professors are great people and want you to succeed (I&#x27;ve spent numerous hours in their help rooms asking questions I had before exams). Don&#x27;t shy away and always reach out for help! This is a very manageable course and it will pay off in the end.</td>

This class is made for students who don&#x27;t have a strong foundation in chemistry and biology, so, if that&#x27;s you, (which was the case for me), it was a lot of information to learn in such a short period of time.

LPSA meets up to 5 times a week (including lab and section), whereas LS1a is more consolidated. Both classes cover roughly the same amount of material, but LPSA just meets more often. Taking LPSA allows you to spend more time in class&#x2F;section asking questions and less time outside of class trying to teach yourself the material. The problem sets and exams are super straightforward, while I have heard that LS1a can be a bit tricky with wording (especially in the biology&ndash;related units). Even if you have taken AP Biology and&#x2F;or AP Chemistry, I would still recommend this class—it&#x27;s a great refresher and will teach you a bit more than the AP curriculum.</td>

Also, for future first&ndash;years, the first three&ndash;ish weeks of this class require your full attention and dedication.

You must grasp the concepts they teach you at the beginning because they&#x27;re very important for the first two exams. It will be difficult especially if you&#x27;re taking this simultaneously with a math course and&#x2F;or a language class, but just make sure to hit up a help room to get your PSET done and you&#x27;ll know how to do the problems. Separately, I really loved attending lecture, especially when Prof. Tucci was teaching. Prof. Tucci has the unique ability to make a 9 am worth it and fun. Also, a special shoutout to section TF Joe Gonzales. Joe is incredible. Every time I went to his help rooms, I understood what was going on.
