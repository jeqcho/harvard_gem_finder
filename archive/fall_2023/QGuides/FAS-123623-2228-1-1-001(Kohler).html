My personal feeling was that the course was taught well: Eddie&#x27;s a great professor who really clearly cares for their students and how much they learn. I unfortunately share very little of their passion for systems; while I thought it was cool to learn about some fundamental topics in &quot;how computers work,&quot; I didn&#x27;t find much of it elegant or cohesive. Lots of systems info feels like tricky, potentially unintuitive, but still very cool solutions to different problems, which to me made it less interesting than a class like CS 121.<br/><br/>Lectures and section are pretty good – you can probably get by on reading lecture notes and watching recorded sections, but Eddie&#x27;s a great lecturer to listen to. I have mixed feelings about problem sets – they probably do a good job of helping you understand the material, but the beginning of some problems sets can be a little confusing&#x2F;unintuitive; I&#x27;d probably recommend going to office hours or talking with friends about approaches before getting started – it might (probably) will end up saving you hours of mind numbing confusion. Also, do extra credit!<br/><br/>Exams in the class are a little annoying. I often felt like they tested you on strange fun facts about systems, and while having a good intuitive understanding of systems can help you pick up points, some of it just comes down to whether or not you can remember fun facts that Eddie mentions during lecture or in problem sets. <br/><br/>Eddie isn&#x27;t teaching 61 next year I don&#x27;t think, so some of this might change, but yeah.

Eddie is incredible. They are amazing at answering questions and a fantastic lecturer. Problem set difficulty can vary A LOT — for me it was mostly dependent on whether or not I hit any nasty bugs.

Not only that, but it is pitch&ndash;black and you can&#x27;t see anything in front of you. Thus is the environment of the CS61 pset. <br/><br/>Now, there are a couple of things people can do to get out of this maze. The most obvious approach is to run around and stumble into walls, while jotting down some notes with pen and paper along the way. After a lot of extremely tiring work and feverishly scribbling down notes on your sheet of paper, you may get out of the maze &ndash; if you&#x27;re lucky. These maze runners symbolize the people who try to do cs61 psets on their own, or with friends who are equally as confused as them. For your sake, don&#x27;t be this type of person. If you don&#x27;t have friends to take this class with you, don&#x27;t do it. <br/><br/>Now many of you may be asking &quot;why don&#x27;t you just go to lecture and sections? Then you can understand what&#x27;s going on and this will help you do the psets.&quot; This is a great suggestion, but you must not overestimate its utility. Watching lectures and understanding material is like entering this maze with a nice flashlight. You&#x27;ll see further than people without one, for sure, but you still have a lot of work to do. This is because the psets are structured in such a way that the lecture material is way too high&ndash;level for it. Just knowing the concepts will not get you much progress in the pset.<br/><br/>Then there are people who enter the maze with a complete map of it stowed in their pocket. All they have to do is examine the map for a bit and walk the correct path. These maze runners symbolize the students who know the correct TFs to go to who can guide them in the pset; like guide them a lot. Or they know other students who know the right TFs and have gone to all the office hours so that they know what to do and can help you out. You want to be this kind of person. You want to have a map of the maze. <br/><br/>If you are able to do the psets well, however, that doesn&#x27;t mean that you will do well on the exams. Because of how hard the psets are, many students are incentivized to &quot;get the map&quot; so to speak, however this will harm your education as a whole, and you won&#x27;t really know what to do when the exam comes around. Thus, my suggestion for students is to first really understand the lecture content, then try your hand on the psets before asking for help. Don&#x27;t spend too much time, however, as it is almost certain that you will need help from a TF or a friend who has finished. At that point, you have to go get the map.</td>

The exams are brutal (averages in the 50&ndash;60 range) but fair, and a decent amount of studying can put you in the 80s or 90s.<br/><br/>I&#x27;m not pursuing any degree in CS, and I just took this class because I thought systems would be a good thing to know for computational biology.  However, I realized a few weeks in that the course is just meant for software engineers who are trying to squeak out a 3% performance improvement in systems that will be used by thousands of people.  Because the vast majority of the class is focused on learning and understanding conventions about computer systems and not on any clever or conceptual ideas, it&#x27;s pretty hard to imagine how to apply this class outside of software engineering.  The assignments are very well made, but actually doing them is such a bear.  You spend half the time trying to figure out where to start and what you&#x27;re even supposed to do and the other half checking conditions until your code magically passes all the tests.  Only at that point when you&#x27;re entirely done do you have enough understanding to actually do anything interesting with what you&#x27;ve written.  But don&#x27;t worry!  Extra credit is essentially required, so there&#x27;ll still be work once you&#x27;re done with the assignment proper.</td>

It primarily uses C, the language used to write most of Linux, to dive into how operating systems, file io, data caching, threading, etc. are implemented on the x86&ndash;64 architecture. There’s a fair proportion of freshmen here, but predominantly upperclassmen. If you’re an incoming freshman, it is quite a jump from AP CS, so hopefully you have programming experience beyond that level. Prior experience in C will help a lot; you do not want to be learning the language&#x2F;syntax on the fly while Professor Kohler plows ahead. That being said, it is one of the few (and one of the hardest) actual coding classes here at Harvard before you get buried in theory. See past course websites; cs61.seas.harvard.edu&#x2F;site&#x2F;2022 for my year, and also the 2018 site has good notes. Pset themes may vary from year to year, but the content should be roughly the same. <br/><br/>Professor: Professor Kohler (Eddy) is an absolute menace at what they do. They enjoy showing us all the quirks of C and make lecture presentations fun and often themed. Eddy is also very responsive to feedback and gives a lot of guidance in class and on the Ed board (see course structure notes below). <br/><br/>Textbook: Did not use it as much as I probably should have, but it provides a good supplement to the theory behind many of the course topics. <br/>Computer Systems: A Programmer’s Perspective, Third Edition by Randal E. Bryant and David R. O’Hallaron<br/><br/>Topics covered: Data representation (size, alignment, memory allocation, argument passing, segments, undefined behavior), Assembly (registers, calling convention, control flow), Kernel (process isolation, robustness, protected control transfer, system calls, virtual memory, page tables), Storage (memory hierarchy, caching, files, stdio, cache optimization&#x2F;coherence, eviction policies), Process Control (fork, execvp, child&#x2F;parent&#x2F;zombie processes, pipes, shells, race conditions), Synchronization (atomicity, threads, data races, mutexes, deadlock, condition variables, blocking&#x2F;polling, databases)<br/><br/>Course structure notes: Ed Discussion (the Ed board) is the forum site for CS61, with feedback from students, TAs, and Eddy. The initial setup is relatively long and generates the first batch of Ed board posts (mostly git&#x2F;Docker; they guide you through the setup on the website, but it helps if you have used both before). Weekly mandatory lectures Monday and Wednesday in the SEC*; Friday lectures are usually supplemental, for questions&#x2F;review&#x2F;advanced topics. 6 psets, in the form of large multi&ndash;step incremental programming assignments, one every two weeks. There’s also these beautiful things called late hours that I got to know very well. Submitted through pushing to git and viewing on the grading server. Weekly sections; usually the first section gives us a boost into the pset and the second goes through exercise problems.

I highly recommend having taken CS50, or to have a background in C or C++, since the entire class is taught in C++ (if you know C, but don’t know C++, you’re completely fine, as the two are very similar). There is almost no math in this course, so you don’t need CS 20, or the like.<br/>The problem sets are very long, but you only get six of them, and they are VERY cool. You start off the semester making your own memory allocator (malloc)... and by the end of it you would have written your own SHELL! One thing I’ve learned in my algorithms course is that good algorithms make your programs run faster on a macro&ndash;level, but at a micro&ndash;level, low level optimizations are crucial for your program’s performance; and that is exactly what you will learn in this course. You acquire a tremendous amount of knowledge that is very fundamental to computer science, and you should definitely take this course if you’re seriously considering a CS concentration!</td>

The TFs are really dedicated, but there were a lot of things that you just had to figure out for yourself.

It&#x27;s hard to provide examples for this, but I think it was more a gut feeling that they (the girls) got where they felt a little hostility or impatience from Eddie in contrast to how Eddie is with some of the boys in the class.

These problem sets are not easy. Do all the extra credit. The midterm and final are extremely tough, so put in the work and study well for those. For those exams especially, practice coding in C&#x2F;C++ and review your past problem sets as many problems may extend from those. Engage in class. If the professor knows your name by the end of the semester, then that means you&#x27;re doing it right.</td>
