It&#x27;s a very good idea to go to lecture &ndash; Cass Sunstein is a solid lecturer and such a personality, and he keeps things witty and light, and section is pretty chill too.</td>

The slides and recordings are not posted afterwards, so the only way to do well on the open&ndash;note take&ndash;home exams is by paying attention and taking good notes in class. The readings are also helpful, but you can usually skim them if you focus in lectures. It can be difficult to pay attention in class sometimes because the slides are not always helpful and the lectures can sometimes be monotonous and all over the place. The material is interesting but is not always taught in an interesting way. There is also not a lot of clarity around the exams beforehand. How well you do typically depends on how well your TF prepares you. The section experience also depends on your TF. Some sections do helpful term reviews and exercises but others spend time on tangential content and activities. Having only 2 assignments in the class can also be stressful at times because it&#x27;s hard to gauge how well you know the material. Overall, there is very little workload between the exams, which is nice. However, it can be stressful around the exams to catch up on everything, especially if you did not pay attention in class. If you take the course, make sure to take good notes, otherwise you&#x27;ll regret it!</td>

Lectures are also not recorded so basically the only way to learn anything is to go to class and pay attention which is honestly very hard to do in this class for some reason. Sunstein is not a bad lecture but there&#x27;s something about his lectures that I just can&#x27;t really follow what he&#x27;s saying at all. Participation is weighted kind of heavily in your grade and lecture is not really where you can get those participation points so that just leads to people trying too hard on Canvas to get those points (you can feel it). It&#x27;s a great time to catch up on emails tho! You also won&#x27;t get a practice exam or an example of how you should be doing the exam so you basically don&#x27;t know what to expect. It&#x27;s a good gened to take I think but I don&#x27;t understand why they gatekeep study materials (they won&#x27;t even give us the mean of the midterm or the rubric!!) and expect you to take notes in class.</td>

He never shared his lecture slides or recordings so you really could only take notes on what he said if you caught it all (he spoke so fast). But he would throw in random tangential anecdotes and I realized during the semester that what he said in lecture was loosely related to the assigned readings so my lecture notes were actually kinda useless. Generally, the course material is interesting and you can get by skimming&#x2F;skipping a few readings here and there (or all of them). You wouldn&#x27;t really get penalized for this because there are no checkpoint assignments during the semester. Hence, my next point: when it&#x27;s time for the midterm and final, PREPARE! Create a study guide with friends, compile notes, etc. 80% of your grade depends on these exams and they&#x27;re intense. They are take&ndash;home so you have time but they require a lot of writing (argumentative style; you have to argue or explain your stance on certain public policy initiatives&#x2F;social movements connecting with topics or case studies from class). These exams were intimidating because the structure was so strict despite the information he discussed in lecture&#x2F;put on his slides being so unstructured. I survived the exams, but I know people who failed terribly. Although I did not like GENED 1102 overall, the single thing I enjoyed about this course was SECTION with my TF Kaumron. He&#x27;s amazing and smart, and I looked forward to his section every week because that&#x27;s where everything made sense truthfully. His section slides were so informative, he cleared up my confusion surrounding certain topics thoroughly, he answered questions very well, and he was a genuinely kind and supportive person. I appreciated when he stepped back from the conceptual learning and asked us to think big picture about what social issues or movements are meaningful to us and how we as future leaders want to push social change. I really loved these introspective moments. Overall, he was a great TF and saved this course for me &ndash;&ndash; 10&#x2F;10!</td>

I appreciated the opportunity to take a course that combined multiple disciplines of interest (behavioral science, history, law, economics) in a way that was applied to important issues in the world. The information and tools provided in this course can be used to approach and solve some of the most pressing problems in the world. Given that the class attracts a wide range of students, there is a unique set of perspectives in the class and I appreciated the opportunity to have discussions with other students in section. I also think another strength of the course was the professor. Professor Sunstein is very knowledgable and had many interesting insights from his personal experiences that helped bring the content to life. I also appreciated the combination of theory and application in this course and specifically how we started with the theory and then used this to ground specific applications presented and discussed later in class. <br/><br/>However, if there could have been more variety in the structure of the lectures, section, and assignments that would have been nice. I think this class is important for those focused on making social change in the world and would recommend it!</td>

Depending on your TF, you might have to put in more effort because some appear to be harsher graders and want you to format your responses in a particular method.

IT IS THE WORST CLASS I&#x27;VE EVER TAKEN, AND IT&#x27;S A GENED. <br/>My friend dropped the class very late into the semester. On the midterm comments, we were explicitly offered to drop the class. I&#x27;ve never taken a class where the test had a comment of how to drop the course. I&#x27;ve taken calculus, organic chemistry, and physics, and this course was worse than those. <br/><br/>The course description and syllabus were inaccurate of what the class ended up being. It was advertised as a class that used behavioral science, psychology, and economics to understand social movements and decisions. It ended up being too legal and political, with some lectures just revolving around what the left versus right thinks. It was also structured way too much as a law course, with the midterm being a completely written 5 hour exam. For friends who are interested in law school, they found the class interesting and somewhat understandable. However, for someone who is STEM and taking this as a GENED, it was very inaccessible. The lectures were incoherent and too dense. The spoken words by Cass were convoluted and hard to follow. The lecture slides had too much information for the little time we had to comprehend them. The readings for the class were at a level that was too advanced for a GENED, and weren&#x27;t applicable to helping us comprehend the material. Despite multiple attempts to get help with the class, myself and my resident dean were denied accommodations and resources. For example, with the lectures being as complicated as they were, I deemed it to have been helpful to have access to the slides. Under no circumstances did the teaching staff provide lecture slides. Additionally, the section structure did not help us understand the material. Some exercises, such as how to make a revolution, very superficially skimmed over the aspects of what creates a revolution. Lastly, there is no exception to having a one&ndash;time section change. Life happens and I couldn&#x27;t always attend the same section time each week. When I requested, ahead of time, to attend a different section time, I was repeatedly denied, making it even harder to understand the week&#x27;s material since I couldn&#x27;t attend section that week. Lastly, the course had horrible section times for both the students and section TFs, with some sections being Friday 4:30&ndash;5:30 and 6&ndash;7 pm. At the beginning of the semester when picking sections, many students were not given their preferred section times. We had to independently work with other students to switch in order to change the section time. Thus, if no student wanted to switch, you were stuck in a section time that didn&#x27;t work for you.</td>

I still recommend reading some of the Supreme Court opinions which are required readings in the second half of the course, particularly Justice Holmes&#x27;s dissent in Lochner. Prof. Sunstein tries to do justice to both sides of a debate, so you will hopefully come out of this course having a better understanding of the opposing views on many issues.

I wasn’t particularly wowed by anything, but still enjoyed the experience. Sections quality and even format vary widely, so your experience might differ greatly from classmates. The lectures were fun but at times very sporadic. Nevertheless, it was interesting to hear his stories during his time at the White House.</td>

We get sick, we have makeup finals to take, and we want to still learn these interesting topics even if we have to miss one day! Sections were helpful but a little decentralized and inconsistent across sections (highly TF&ndash;dependent). Lecture slides were prepared by the Prof himself so you can tell he put effort into it, but it&#x27;s a little disorganized and hard to take notes of before they&#x27;re gone and onto the next. Lecture slides are NOT accessible to students and that doesn&#x27;t make sense&ndash;&ndash;it prevents students from more thoroughly learning the material in case something was covered too quickly in class and they didn&#x27;t get to write it down. It also helps with studying and review! Lastly, I wish the lectures were more structured and less about Prof. Sunstein telling us anecdotes. It is really hard to follow along with the logical reasoning or string of ideas that we are supposed to learn&#x2F;takeaway from the lecture or that anecdote he just covered in class.</td>

Sunstein has such a wealth of knowledge to share from his career in academia and in the government, and he&#x27;s not afraid to drop the occasional subtle flex that will also make you laugh. The readings are long and mostly re&ndash;hashed in lecture, but a lot of the content really is worth engaging with because it&#x27;s based on years of research, a lot of which Sunstein had a personal hand in. I wish I was more engaged with Sunstein as a professor &ndash; he&#x27;s not the easiest to get in touch with, but I recommend doing it early in the semester because he&#x27;s such a cool guy</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_e95b9c33-39e1-4cfd-8d68-8022045a6291">Make starting your readings early a habit! Starting too late can leave you with too much reading for one night, making it more likely that you&#x27;ll miss important details or feel unmotivated to finish. Paying attention in class is also critical to remaining engaged with the material, though it is often easy to still catch the general drift of the class from periodically tuning in. If possible, try not to switch into the class too late in the semester, as it is a bit hard to catch up in.</td>
