Emma, Michael, Ben, and Kara are absolutely amazing and really care about the success of all of their students. If you&#x27;re nervous about your mathematical ability in relation to the course, if you&#x27;ve taken Calc BC and loosely understood the concepts you should be fine, Michael does a series of lectures entitled &quot;Remembering Calculus&quot; that help a lot. On the latter half of my first sentence, there are certain cases where this class might not be the best fit. If you&#x27;re interested in doing research outside of class first term, don&#x27;t take the class, it will be too much to handle. If you have little interest in the lab topic(you can find it on the course website prior to class starting), a large part of this course will not be fun for you. If you are not comfortable with &quot;bad&quot; grades(you will not be getting As on every test), do not take this course. You will struggle, it will not be fun on Friday night at 1 AM grappling with the coding problem you held off until the last minute, but long term it is totally worth it. If you&#x27;re willing to put in the effort and love the struggle behind learning, this course is most definitely for you! Cells are nifty!!</td>

The class, community, and course staff are incredible and 100% worth the two class slots taken up by the course. Daily lectures plus section, lab, and office hours might seem like a heavy load at first, but they are really quite manageable in the long run. The topics we cover in class are far beyond what you&#x27;d get the chance to learn in any other first&ndash;year life science course and provide a fantastic introduction for any life science concentration. Be sure to take advantage of all the office hours and PSet sessions offered; they&#x27;re a great way to bond with the other LS50 students and have fun conversations with upperclassmen and course staff about their experiences with science and research.  Please, please, please give LS50 a try; it&#x27;s made my first semester at Harvard so worthwhile!</td>

I came into LS50a with a relatively comprehensive science background (coursework in biology, chemistry, physics, and environmental science at the highest levels afforded by the AP and IB curricula), but I still left every lecture feeling that I had learned something new. This course is fast&ndash;paced, but it&#x27;s intensely awarding, and course staff are genuinely and personally invested in your development. Even when the course itself becomes hard, the community surrounding LS50a allows it to remain engaging and enjoyable! My first semester would have been quite different without LS50a, and while I can&#x27;t know for sure, I&#x27;d wager that LS50a made my freshman fall the best it could&#x27;ve been.  I&#x27;d especially recommend LS50a to first years from high schools with small class sizes, people who learn best through guided discovery, and individuals interested in studying the natural sciences through a quantitative lens, but I think a passion for science and a willingness to collaborate are the only true prerequisites for success in LS50a.<br/><br/>With regard to advice for students interested in taking the course, I prefer to take notes by hand and stubbornly insisted on doing so for the entirety of this course, but I would strongly suggest that you consider taking notes with the aid of technology; this allows you to annotate slides uploaded prior to the lecture rather than copying all of the content on the slides by hand, enabling you to devote more attention to the (very engaging and interesting!) lecturers. I&#x27;d also advise students to set a schedule for the completion of problem sets early on, ideally aiming to finish problem sets over the weekend after they are assigned. Especially if you are planning to take another pset class (as I did), procrastination on assignments can quickly lead to some very late Thursday nights, and I think avoiding the stress associated with completing assignments in a rush could only enrich your enjoyment of the course. Also, lean into the double&ndash;course component of LS50a; devote nearly twice as much time to LS50a as you do to each of your other courses, even if that time involves interacting without classmates and course&ndash;staff rather than completing assignments—the community was one of my favorite parts of LS50a, and one of my only regrets about this semester of LS50a is that I didn&#x27;t engage with it enough.</td>

While it may seem like a more competitive class because so many people are pre&ndash;med, everyone is still really collaborative and especially with doing pset together.

You will learn SO MUCH, and everyone&#x27;s basically on the same playing field when it comes to this class because of how in&ndash;depth and challenging the course material is. This course has been a defining aspect of my freshman year, and although it is stressful, it is so incredibly rewarding. The material covered is so interesting, and it really teaches you how to synthesize the different fields of science in a holistic way. You WILL struggle, but in the end, it will be worth it. Also, the community is phenomenal. I&#x27;ve made some of my closest friends through this class, and the small class size is really good at fostering a sense of belonging. GO TO OFFICE HOURS. The CAs and TFs are so helpful and sweet, and I don&#x27;t think I could&#x27;ve made it through this class without them. At the very worst, this class will show you that life sciences isn&#x27;t the path for you, but you&#x27;ll still leave the class feeling a sense of satisfaction with yourself that YOU DID IT. tldr, take the class! It will be hard, but it is the most rewarding experience ever.</td>

You will learn concepts that you would probably never learn in a class again, and the basic biology and chemistry that you learned in high school seem very simple and easy in comparison. I really liked that this class shows you the steps that were used to come up with concepts and that our p&ndash;set and exam questions were experimentally based, that is there are usually multiple possible answers. The course staff is great, and our class became really close. If you are on the fence about taking the class, I think the determining factor should be how good your math skills are. While a lot of the biology and chemistry concepts were new to us, LS50 treats math as a tool. You need to have very strong algebra skills, at a minimum, and be able to follow derivatives and integrals with only a few intermediary steps. I felt the workload was manageable and was even less than the workload of a comparable math and science class.</td>

Some people make being pre&ndash;med their personality, but with ls50 added into the mix, you&#x27;ll be a much more well&ndash;rounded personality. In class, you&#x27;ll be sitting next to 30&ndash;40 peers who are just as confused as you, and outside of class, you&#x27;ll be working on psets, rewatching the lectures, scrolling through the 80+ slide decks, and (quite inevitably) talking about ls50. It really depends on the students you&#x27;re with but our class was filled with some of the best people I&#x27;ve ever met. Now, with all the work I&#x27;ve put in and the amazing peers&#x2F;instructors&#x2F;CA&#x27;s&#x2F;TA&#x27;s, was I good at ls50? Not by a longshot. But the class makes you forget about grades (or maybe it&#x27;s just me who&#x27;s given up?) and shift focus to learning the topics at hand. It&#x27;s a class worth taking if you don&#x27;t mind a little suffering to go with your epiphanies. At times, you&#x27;ll find yourself drawing cursed images or portraits of the instructors during lectures. Other times, you&#x27;re in Cabot at midnight chuckling at some dry jokes Michael made four classes ago.

He said, &quot;LS50 is an amazing course if you&#x27;re prepared to sacrifice your freshman year on the altar of the life sciences.&quot; Although I think this statement is somewhat exaggerated, it certainly gets the spirit right. I haven&#x27;t exactly sacrificed my freshman year. I still have plenty of time for other classes, extracurriculars, and a vibrant social life. However, LS50 is my biggest time commitment by far, and it takes up 4 of my 8 slots for classes. If you&#x27;re not interested in learning about biology for biology&#x27;s sake, if you don&#x27;t want to be relentlessly challenged by the twists and turns of your problem sets or aren&#x27;t prepared to spend three&ndash;plus hours a week doing new research on a topic of which you have no prior knowledge, you should not consider this class. However, if you&#x27;re a massive nerd about biology, there&#x27;s not a better community on campus for you. This class has 35 students, 4 CAs, 4 TFs, and 3 professors, all of whom offer advice and support to the best of their ability. Whether you have a question about a problem set, getting into research, planning your concentration, or life in general, LS50 provides amazing resources to help you out.

However, if you have ever had even the slightest notion of going to grad school or getting involved with research, absolutely without a doubt take this class. I refuse to believe that any better community outside of LS50 exists. You will leave this class having met and befriended some of the most interesting and inspiring students, graduate students, and instructors. The course staff devote just as much time, if not more, as you do to the class. The support and encouragement is absolutely phenomenal. The class is absolutely worth all the long nights, hard work, uncertainty and confusion that come along with it. You do not need to be a world renowned prodigy or come from one of the best schools in the world. This course elevates and empowers everyone who puts the effort in to get everything out of it. Taking LS50 was most definitely the highlight of my freshman fall.

That doesn&#x27;t mean that you shouldn&#x27;t take this course, however, and while it&#x27;s true that there are national competition winners taking this class (whatever olympiad or ScienceBowl competition you can think of), I certainly wasn&#x27;t one of them. For that matter, I didn&#x27;t even get a 5 on AP Bio and half of this course&#x27;s content is (supposedly) based on bio. But, with that being said, I can&#x27;t write this course off as a course that you can just get by with by yourself &ndash; you will learn to connect with other students at office hours and outside of office hours and find a way to build a community. That is, unless you happened to have taken all of the content that LS50 covers in high school (which there are some people that do). Furthermore, I implore you think on the benefits of this course beyond just the course itself and the community that it builds &ndash; do you need this course for the concentration requirements that it satisfies? If you are a pre&ndash;med planning on doing a double concentration in one of the concentrations that this class barely fills, then maybe this class is not for you (because it can and will take up a lot of your time whether you want it to or not). Also do consider how many other courses you are taking &ndash; don&#x27;t overload yourself in your first semester with courses that are time and work intensive if you are set on taking this class. With all that in consideration, if you are still on the fence, I would say go for it &ndash; you can always add&#x2F;drop the course in the first few weeks if you don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s the right fit for you, and switch into another course.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_434b7fab-ec6b-4db8-b5dc-71e538b869c0">This class is a great experience. You learn a lot from a large variety of topics, some of which I had some background on before coming to college (cell cycle, genetics) and some of which I had never heard of (stat mech), but all of which we learned interesting new ways of thinking about. <br/><br/>I was worried that I would not have enough math experience coming in, as I had only done up to AP calculus (while many I talked to had taken multi or linear algebra), but this was not the case. While almost every unit has a math based approach, most of the math is well weaved into the other topics, and I did not need more than my knowledge of integrals&#x2F;derivatives from BC calc (they sometimes use more complicated stuff in lectures so that we can know where their values came from, but you typically don&#x27;t need to know how to replicate them for assignments). Prior experience with Python or a similar coding language is helpful, but not necessary as they will review everything you need to know and there will inevitably be someone in your class who knows how to code and can help you. I was also worried because I did not have any research experience coming in, but this wasn&#x27;t a big problem either. Most people in the class have lab experience, which made me feel inexperienced, but they talked us through everything we needed to know in lab, so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. In terms of the bio&#x2F;chem&#x2F;physics content, it is mostly bio, and you should be fine if you did well in high school AP bio&#x2F;chem. <br/><br/>The PSETs are difficult and you should start them early in the week and go to CA office hours, but they are not so long that you physically cannot finish them in the day or two before (it will just be a terrible experience), and there is only 1 a week (as opposed to the 4 a week you&#x27;d have between Math21a and LS1a). Organize study groups early in the year to make friends and stay on top of your work. LS50 is not the guaranteed bonding experience some of the Qreports make it out to be, but if you put in some effort to go to study sessions and talk to people in the class, you&#x27;ll definitely meet some good friends.  The midterms (our year at least) are easier than the PSETs, so if you do well on them and the practice exam, you are probably well prepared. If you are worried about workload and settling into, you could take a GenEd and a Freshman Seminar (like I did) with LS50, but honestly, it was not as much work as I thought it would be and I wish I&#x27;d taken a harder 3rd class.  <br/><br/>The professors, TFs, and CAs were all amazing our year (Andrew Murray was on sabbatical, so I can&#x27;t say for him, but Michael, Emma, Ben, and Kara were fantastic). They all have regular office hours (though most fell in times I couldn&#x27;t attend, so I suppose I can&#x27;t speak to their quality) and give engaging lectures with helpful slides (well.... Michael&#x27;s can be a bit hard to follow, but you the classes are recorded so you can just rewatch parts). The CAs and TFs also office hours&#x2F;PSET sessions which are very helpful<br/><br/>I can&#x27;t say much about the labs since they change every year, but getting to do original research for the first time was very cool (even if I don&#x27;t want to look at another ant for the rest of my life), but three straight hours every tuesday on top of an hour of LS50 and potentially an hour of another class is A LOT, but it was doable once we got through the initial lecture based lab sessions. If you are in a lab section right after class, make sure to eat some lunch. The cafe on the first floor of Northwest has some decent food and accepts Board Plus.  <br/><br/>LS50 will NOT take over your life. It will be a heavy time commitment, and you will have to study a lot, but it does not have to consume your every waking moment. I had plenty of time to join clubs, make friends, and relax (except maybe in the day or two right before a midterm). I highly recommend this class because your first semester can feel strange and overwhelming, and it&#x27;s grounding to have a regular class that meets every weekday and is a similar size to high school classes. Overall, this class is not easy, but I don&#x27;t think it is much harder than taking LS1a and a math course, and instead of two large, generic classes, you get a more unique and personal experience from the small class size and original research.</td>

Indeed, this class WILL consume your freshman year. The psets are difficult and the class learning pace is FAST.

Topics definitely centered around biology, but in practice we did quite a bit of math and physics (which ends up being a lot of math, too) applied to biology, as well as some chemistry and Python coding. The professors and course staff were great lecturers and incredibly dedicated to the course, and there was such a large support system surrounding this class, which made the often difficult assignments much more manageable. I found the weekly problem sets to be very well&ndash;written and interesting, which made the extensive work that came with them much more enjoyable. The small class size created a tight&ndash;knit community surrounding the course, and I met many of my closest friends from this course. Be prepared for a significant workload that can be somewhat unevenly distributed over the course of the semester. However, there is a huge bang for your buck, since it counts for two of your four first semester courses – I would definitely say that LS 50a had less work than most combinations of two other introductory STEM courses. The lab portion of the course contributed to some of this unevenness, since it picked up substantially over the last few weeks of the semester. The lab changes every year though, to assure that students have a unique experience working on the forefront of a particular field, so this experience might be different in subsequent iterations of the course. My main piece of advice for this course is to manage your time well – attendance was expected every day at lecture, as well as for section and lab. Thankfully, lectures were recorded in case you missed the odd lecture, but you just cannot get behind in this course, because it moves fast, and it will be hard to catch back up. If you love science, learning, and research, and are alright with committing two course slots for two semesters, this course is perfect for you.</td>

The community that LS50 builds is incredible and the fun that you will have doing psets together and just hanging out will be some of the best fun of your first semester. Also, the lab, in my opinion, is the gem of the course &ndash; you get to do original research on incredibly interesting topics (for us, it was ant evolutionary biology!) in a very chill environment, which is such a rare opportunity for first&ndash;year undergrads. My main suggestion would be to go to ALL of the office hours &ndash; for all of the lecturers, all of the TFs, and all of the CA drop&ndash;in hours.

Yes, the material can be challenging and the class has a bit of a reputation, but if you want to learn about the sciences in an interdisciplinary way and stretch your brain, I can think of no better community to do so in. The instructors, TFs, and CAs are all extraordinarily kind, supportive, and knowledgeable. This class will take a lot of your time, but it will also give you a new way of thinking and broaden your science horizons. I was also on the fence about whether I should take LS50.

If all else fails, you can use the coin toss (ex. heads = LS50, tails = not LS50), but instead of blindly going with the outcome, you use your reaction to the outcome to make a decision.

You quickly learn concepts from various fields of science and immediately begin applying them in interesting ways. Through things like PSET questions with real&ndash;world science problems or the lab portion of the class where we did real research, the class really pushes you to think like a scientist. You are encouraged to question things and not think of science as a concrete thing but use theories and ideas to make predictions. As a result, this makes this class a lot more rewarding than alternatives (LPSA&#x2F;LS1A).<br/><br/>Another big strength of this course is the environment that is developed. The course staff is very supportive from the professors to the TFs to the CAs. You always have somewhere to go if you ever have questions and there are constant opportunities to get help. This class also is not purposefully designed to make your life more difficult so that as long as you work hard enough, you can get results. You also make connections with the students in the class since the class size is so small. <br/><br/>In only the fall semester, we had four different lecturers and this created diversity in the fields of science we were exposed to. Although it could sometimes feel overwhelming as it felt like there were various topics thrown together and being taught simultaneously, the lecturers did a great job in teaching this all with an LS50 style.&quot;<br/><br/>To be as realistic as possible, this class will take up most of your time in your freshman fall. If you have a solid science background and wanna have an enriching experience, I urge you to take this class. The lectures are very solid and you will be able to learn a lot through the PSETs as you work on them with peers. There is a lot of math in the class, but as someone who wasn&#x27;t particularly strong in the subject, I was able to follow along just fine. I suggest that you do not get distracted by your classmates and their backgrounds because the professors try to teach everything starting from a foundational level. Make sure to be able to do the PSET questions individually because that will supplement your learning so much more and you will also thank me when finals come along.</td>

If you are looking for a fascinating, well&ndash;taught course with a very tight&ndash;knit community, TAKE THIS CLASS!! I cannot recommend LS50 enough. <br/><br/>Coming in, I had reservations about the amount of time and space that LS50 took up (lectures every day, section, and a 3&ndash;hour lab), but it is truly worth this time and so much more. Because you spend so much time in and out of the classroom with your classmates, the class community is super close and your LS50 classmates will likely become some of your closest friends during your first semester in college. And, the course staff are amazing and super accessible if you have any questions or concerns. Moreover, this is your first semester in college: perfect time to experience multiple disciplines in science to figure out your interests. LS50 presents so many fields to you in only two course slots: Python&#x2F;CS, statistics, math, chemistry, biology. It is the perfect exploratory course for those interested in science.<br/><br/>LS50 is not your standard biology course—even if you’ve been exposed to an extremely high level of biology in high school (i.e. through Biology Olympiad, Science Olympiad, or research), LS50 will give you a different perspective on the field. An experimental perspective, where you learn how to design genetically&ndash;altered mice in order to analyze stem cells and regenerative biology (the course teaches you a lot of the foundations of SCRB!). A mathematical and quantitative perspective, where you learn how to model phenomena like diffusion, cooperativity, entropy, and ecological interactions using statistics and calculus. It will challenge you, regardless of what your background in biology is.<br/><br/>In addition, because LS50 presents biology in a way that most students probably have never been exposed to, everyone is in it together, regardless of what science background you came in with. As long as you have the level of science&#x2F;math background recommended on the website and a strong desire to learn, you will do great!

It&#x27;s really nice to be able to ask questions during class and engage with the professors.  Also, if you are interested in research in any capacity (whether for a summer or as a career), then you will probably enjoy this course.  Many of our lectures connected to various types of research, and the lab component of this course is a research project which is really cool.  The problem sets in this class definitely reinforce learning,  and although they can be difficult, we are able to work together and collaborate and office hours are so helpful.  The midterms are also very challenging, but they are meant to be challenging.  The overall grading also considers participation and lab work as well as problem sets, so the midterms are not the only thing that determines how well you do in the class.  One other thing about the class is that everyone has strengths in different areas.   Some students are stronger in bio, and other students are stronger in chem.  We work together to help teach each other based on prior experiences and strengths&#x2F;weaknesses.  Overall, this class is hard but I highly recommend it.

It’s truly a class you can only find at Harvard. Yes, it’s hard, but I think it’s very much worth it. There’s also really great support and lots of opportunities to get help (there’s office hours basically every day) so as long as you reach out when you need it it’s very much doable. Theres such a strong community from everyone psetting together and some of my best friends I’ve made this year are from this class. If you meet the prereqs (know calc BC, some intro bio and chem, some cs background also helps) but are on the fence like I was, I highly recommend you try it. I can’t rave about this class enough, so just trust me and take it (you can always add drop later).</td>

It is quite hard, but will change the way you view science and the world. if you like science and have a determination to learn and you love learning, this class is incredible. Disciplines will be intersected in very innovative ways. You get to do original research in a lab too! The professors and TFs are so kind and will be there to help you! There are more than enough resources to do well in this class if you care enough to do so.</td>

It has everything that you would want in a class: a great community of 30&ndash;40 students, extensive time to get to know your teaching staff, incredible scientific topics that you will not learn in any other intro life science class, and just so much fun. I was in a similar boat of almost choosing LS1a if it weren&#x27;t for an upperclassman who told me about this class, and to this day, I have 0 regrets. <br/>First of all, you will get to know everyone in the class and the teaching staff make an effort to get to know you on first name basis. Even though this class is challenging, you will like you have a safe environment to ask anyone anything. I&#x27;ve had pretty deep conversations with course faculty about life, scientific approaches, finding research opportunities, problem sets, concepts, etc. You don&#x27;t find this sort of environment and level of engagement in any Harvard class or any college class. <br/>Second, your classmates in LS50 will make everything better. When things get difficult and overwhelming (which oh&ndash;boy, they definitely will), you will work through the semester WITH your classmates. 2am pset sessions at the Inn, eating lunch together almost everyday after class, pep&ndash;talking each other, holding small get&ndash;togethers after a long pset night, Lamonstering every night, attending research fairs&#x2F;events together, and so so much more. When you&#x27;re having a difficult time, there will be at least 5 people in your vicinity who are willing to spend their own time working with you and helping you out.<br/>Third, the science taught in this class. I came in with a pretty broad range of science background and felt like I enjoyed all of them, so this class was perfect in combining those interests into meshed version. It&#x27;s all types of life sciences applied with a perspective of statistics, math, chemistry, physics, etc. that make it so interesting. A true &quot;Harvard&ndash;ian&quot; experience. This class made my semester.</td>

It really lives up to the &quot;integrated science&quot; name, covering everything from statistics to chemistry to developmental biology. After taking the class, I am much more excited about studying biology and, surprisingly, math. Time commitment is definitely real, and that should be a major consideration. The work is challenging and involved, but the support system is extremely accessible and helpful. Another cool aspect of the course I enjoyed was the lab&#x27;s focus on original research. Instead of running through tried&ndash;and&ndash;true biology textbook experiments, you work in a lab and conduct new research. It&#x27;s extremely rewarding, but also disappointing at times when results don&#x27;t pan out. The experience is definitely unique, though! Overall, this class does teach you to &quot;think like a scientist&quot;. Concretely, that means conducting back&ndash;of&ndash;envelope calculations to assess plausible hypotheses, being confident deriving things from first principles, and designing experiments in many different fields of biology.</td>

You get to see how everything merges to form new understanding. The TFs and CAs and instructors are all very friendly, and each of the instructor has their unique profession and background in relevance to their teaching. For example, Michael handles most of the physics and maths while Emma is knowledgeable in chemistry. There were times when I doubted my ability, but this course encouraged me to continue studying life science. <br/><br/>LAB: Personally, I feel unmotivated in the lab but I think it&#x27;s because of the topic this year is about ants (I am neither interested in zoology nor evolutionary biology and these two formed the core of the lab this year), but I appreciate it because it gives me mmore understanding how research works and the symposium at the end of semester is so COOL. <br/><br/>PYTHON: CS in LS50 is actually pretty basic (maybe because I took CS50) and you can search up most of the stuffs online. How the CS component is different from CS50 is that it focusses on the graphical and mathematical application, a.k.a. you will use Python to draw graphs and simulate dynamical systems, which is pretty cool because you never get to do this in CS50.<br/><br/>EXAMS: we have 3 mid&ndash;terms and 1 final and before each exam we will have a mock paper and their difficulty differs a lot. For example, the mock paper for the first mid&ndash;term is harder than the first mid&ndash;term, but the mock paper for the second mid&ndash;term is easier than the second mid&ndash;term (I think the average score for second mid&ndash;term was 78 if I remember it correctly, so don&#x27;t be discouraged). You get to know the average score across the class and I think that is useful so that you know where you stand in the class and use that as a motivation.</td>

But at the end of the day, what you learned and gained are unbelievably rewarding. There is no other freshmen life science course that exposes you to the breadth and depth of content that this does, alongside with the strong support system that makes you feel so so welcomed. I do not regret my choice taking LS50 because of the AMAZING sense of community and the new ways I approach science now.  I am wholeheartedly grateful for all my experiences, whether painful or joyful, and for all the people I met along the way.</td>

You will be thinking about LS50 all the time, you will grow close with your classmates (I have made some great friends through this course), you will be frustrated at times, but you will learn a TON. To say that is is worth the challenge is an understatement. There is so much fascinating material presented and the course moves so quickly that the class is a continuous learning experience. The Problem Sets are challenging, as are Exams, but there is so much support from the teaching staff that nothing every feels unreasonable. Additionally, the small class size is perfect for fostering a collaborative environment. If you are thinking about taking this course, I would definitely recommend it. It really is special in its ability to bring together some great peers and push its students to learn at the best of their ability.</td>
