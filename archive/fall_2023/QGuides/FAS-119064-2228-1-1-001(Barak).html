There definitely is some overlap between the two classes, but definitely not enough to skip one after taking the other.<br/>Honestly, if I could go back I would have taken CS 121.  I feel like it would have served as a more gentle introduction to some of the techniques used when writing proofs of correctness for algorithms (e.g. showing completeness and soundness).  CS 124 hit the ground running, and just assumed you either understood these already or that you would learn it on your own.<br/><br/>CS 121 is a very manageable undergraduate CS course.  I highly recommend actually doing the readings before the corresponding lecture; I found that gave me the most complete understanding of each topic.<br/>The psets take some work but aren&#x27;t that bad.  There are also a lot of opportunities for extra credit, which makes things less stressful.

Be aware that there seems to be a selection bias amongst students who chose to take this class over CS120, so the exams medians tended to be extremely high (for Midterm 2 it was above 100% with EC).

I&#x27;d heard mixed reports (and seen the previous years&#x27; Q guides), but I had a great time. The material is super interesting, the psets&#x2F;midterms&#x2F;final were totally fair and manageable, and there&#x27;s a ton of extra credit so there&#x27;s very little grade pressure. Prof. Barak is a great instructor, and he clearly cares a lot about the students. There&#x27;s a lot of reading, but the book is written specifically for the course, and you quickly develop a sense of what can safely be skipped. My one issue with the class is that expectations for participation were not clearly conveyed. The syllabus made it seem like section was optional, but they took attendance at section&#x2F;OH, and similarly lecture was not mandatory but if you didn&#x27;t go you were expected to participate in other ways. Also, we were graded on our Perusall participation, but nobody ever wrote anything so it was hard to participate (I generally think that Perusall is a bad idea, but I digress). <br/><br/>I do think that this is not a class that most sophomores should be taking, and I feel like I got a lot more out of it by waiting until senior fall. It requires a fair amount of mathematical sophistication, and many of the bad Q reviews from previous years are just people who were not prepared for a theoretical course like this. If you take this class as an upperclassman with CS 20, CS 124 and&#x2F;or a bunch of math classes under your belt, and you&#x27;re comfortable with proofs, then you&#x27;ll be able to appreciate the beautiful subject that is TCS without the learning curve of proofs. <br/><br/>Finally, since this really is the only place to say this: it is a huge failure of Harvard&#x27;s CS department that CS 221 is only offered every few years, and that CS 125 hasn&#x27;t been offered in awhile. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I greatly enjoyed 121, but I really wanted to challenge myself this fall, and there was no more advanced way for me to fulfill this concentration requirement. A school of Harvard&#x27;s caliber should be offering grad&ndash;level TCS classes (or at least one class) yearly so that students who want to push themselves in a more intense and advanced class are able to do so.</td>

I strongly recommend this!<br/><br/>Sometimes though, the comments of graders felt a bit insulting. They sometimes act like we have no experience with any of the materials and assume little background, and they can deduct points for random things that are obvious. This was especially a problem with midterm 2 where they gave 0 points for solving a problem in a different way than they wanted, and wouldn&#x27;t accept any regrade requests. The answer they gave was very dismissive and reflected a grading philosophy based on punishment, rather than giving meaningful feedback. I think this can be a problem in general in CS where people assume that others do not know as well and interpret different ways of reasoning as flawed. As a CA for a math class, I always try to give very comprehensive feedback when I am going to deduct a large amount of points, and I try to make sure I am not misunderstanding the student. I think this is the philosophy they should have embraced. Other than this, I think the course was great, and this fortunately does not affect your experience too badly.

If you enjoy theoretical CS and formal reasoning, you&#x27;ll probably enjoy this class. If you enjoy more practical and applicable sides of CS more, however, this class probably won&#x27;t be very rewarding. If choosing between this class and 124, I&#x27;d recommend most people take 124; although 124 is harder, the concepts are more useful and applicable, and I think the class is better structured.</td>

I don&#x27;t know how it compares to CS120, but the class is very well&ndash;designed and the material is interesting, so I would definitely recommend it to any CS concentrator.</td>

It is one of those courses where you can&#x27;t really treat it like a side dish; it&#x27;s a main entree course and it&#x27;ll require a lot of your attention&#x2F;focus.</td>

This class may be harder, but the stuff you learn in this class will not be useful to you unless you definitely plan to go into research. It&#x27;s cool to learn some of the fundamentals, but prepare to get a bad grade unless you are constantly at office hours</td>

I wasn&#x27;t expecting to enjoy theoretical CS at all, but I found a lot of results&#x2F;concepts from this class really intriguing and unexpected (e.g., Rice&#x27;s theorem, Y combinators, PRGs, Turing machines, etc), especially as someone who came into this class without any exposure to theoretical CS. I&#x27;d definitely recommend at least considering taking 121 – I know that CS 120 has become a much more popular option now that enrollment for that class isn&#x27;t capped, and while 120 probably does a better job of preparing you for tech interviews than 121, I think that CS 121 introduces you to some really interesting concepts that aren&#x27;t covered in 120 (e.g., PRGs, etc).<br/><br/>That being said, 121 isn&#x27;t without its own flaws&#x2F;differences – unlike MIT&#x27;s TOC course, CS 121 uses Boaz&#x27;s textbook, which still contains some typos and takes an unconventional approach to TCS. I thought that starting with NAND circuits and generally taking a more circuit&ndash;based approach was interesting and insightful, but I know some people who say they really would have preferred the standard approach to TOC covered in textbooks like Sipser. I also felt a bit lost at the very end of the course when we covered quantum computing – I think it was covered a little too quickly and assumed a little too much from the students wrt how much they would know about quantum notation&#x2F;theory.<br/><br/>I still think the pros way outweighs the cons though: 121 is really interesting to begin with, and it&#x27;s clear that Boaz cares a ton about his students and how well they learn the content in the class. There&#x27;s so much extra credit in the class on psets and exams that it&#x27;s super easy to get a 100 under psets (capped at 100) and its very doable to get 100+ on exams. CS 121.5 sections (where they invite profs and postdocs and the like to give related lectures) are super interesting (would definitely recommend trying to go to a few, even if you&#x27;re unsure if you&#x27;ll understand it all!), and 121 sections in general are really useful for pinning down the content. Problem sets are also interesting – they do a really nice job of tying course content together, and the results can be really insightful.<br/><br/>If you&#x27;re on the border of trying 121 out, I&#x27;d go for it! Definitely would have regretted not taking it this semester!</td>
