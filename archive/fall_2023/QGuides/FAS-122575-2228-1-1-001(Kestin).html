			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_2e0e7e5d-b129-43e4-9d91-4ce92d912b99">I think there were many strengths of this course. To start, I appreciated the intentionality in the course. In terms of the content, I am grateful for the connections that the course makes between physics and medicine&#x2F;biology to highlight how a course that may not be the direct focus of students&#x27; studies can be relevant and important to what they are interested in. I thought the course staff did a great job in choosing problems that were relevant to our interests and helped us to better understand the world around us. Secondly, I think the way they presented information was very intentional and important. I think it was helpful to learn about some of the material taught in class before that class began and then to have an opportunity to review that content at the start of class and build on what we learned through practice problems and the opportunity to ask questions in class. I found the teaching staff (the lecturers and the TFs&#x2F;CAs) to be particularly incredible. I found Anna and Greg to be especially caring, thoughtful, and kind and the other members of the teaching staff to be supportive as well. I am very grateful for the enthusiasm and engagement that Anna and Greg brought to the classroom and how much they cared about our wellbeing. I learned a lot during this class and felt excited about the material and very much supportive throughout the semester. I also thought that the lab was great in being able to introduce other content related to what we learned in class that was important to use in physics and relevant to concepts from other disciplines. I very much appreciated the opportunity to learn about and practice using the scientific process and experimenting. This class was a great physics class to take, especially if you are premed, and the teaching staff is awesome. Also, the demos in this class are amazing!</td>

The course staff really tries to set you up for success and make physics as accessible as possible to everyone. Along those lines, they are very receptive to student feedback, so if you feel that a certain component of the class was unfair (e.g. a homework deadline right after Harvard&ndash;Yale weekend), just tell them and they&#x27;re likely to change it accordingly!! <br/><br/>Start early when studying for the exams and do LOTS of practice problems, especially the section handouts!</td>

I originally wanted to do PS12a&#x2F;b, but it didn&#x27;t work with my schedule. After attending the first PS2 lecture, I felt like I wanted something more stimulating but not too much (ie physics 15a&#x2F;b), so I tried AP50a. Big mistake. It culminated in a month of frustration and refusal to adapt to student feedback, and so I switched from AP50 into PS2 several weeks into the semester. If you only care about a good grade and don&#x27;t mind doing waste&ndash;of&ndash;time tasks to get it, do AP50, because you&#x27;ll get an A as long as you make a good faith attempt at everything (regardless of the quality of your work&#x2F;how much you actually are learning). If you&#x27;re hoping to actually learn physics concepts and not waste your time with useless projects and group meetings, do PS 2. AP50 drove me insane because of how unclear&#x2F;disorganized they are, how much they baby you, and how they make you do so much busy work (plus there&#x27;s a lot of incentive for your group members to freeload off of you since it&#x27;s all group&ndash;based). I personally would rather spend three hours on a PS2 pset rather than spending three hours every Sunday on an online textbook that tracks how much time you spend on each page and how many comments&#x2F;upvotes you give. But it&#x27;s all up to how you are as an individual &ndash; if you tend to operate on your own, PS 2 is for you, and if you like depending on others (but in randomly assigned groups), AP 50 is for you. And even though it&#x27;s a better (like quite honestly a more legitimate) physics class, PS2 is still extremely nice to you &ndash; they do ridiculous things like ask if you want ten extra minutes on a midterm and adjust grade thresholds to be nicer if people are struggling. Greg and Anna are solid lecturers, and they are incredibly generous and understanding, almost to the point of it being too much&#x2F;too kind. Compared to the chem 17&#x2F;27 orgo series, PS 2 is a cake walk.</td>

The assignments and exams are really fair (you get a cheat sheet for exams and there is a group portion!) and there are so many assignments and participation points that go into your grade so it is a lot more stress free than other pre&ndash;med classes. The professors are so nice and do so much to try and keep the course interesting.</td>

I&#x27;m a horrible test taker and after the second PS2 midterm I thought for sure I would not be getting an A&ndash;&#x2F;A in the course, however, I quickly learned that the teaching staff is very generous in their grading policies! They truly are on your side&ndash;&ndash;trust me. So, even if you&#x27;re a terrible test taker like me, you&#x27;re still going to do fine in the course. I&#x27;d recommend studying hard for that first exam, because they did grade regularly on that one and most people end up doing well on it, so if you don&#x27;t do great on it it might set you back. Otherwise, course is fine!</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_2e0e7e5d-b129-43e4-9d91-4ce92d912b99">Gist of the class: This class is a very chill introductory physics class. It seems to be geared towards premeds who need to get their physics requirement out of the way. I am not premed, but I still find this class a good class to take if you just want to know the gist of physics without having to face really intense stuff. Physics is spoon fed to you, but not in a terrible way. In the lectures, the instructors help you derive certain equations. Then, for homework we have this thing call Achieve, which is just a bunch of practice problems that use those equations. And then, after those practice problems, we have a pset that is basically those practice problems and concept but a more advanced and critical version. The practice problems are a good gateway to the psets. The homework load is not bad at all. Each week, we have 20&ndash;30 practice problems on Achieve, which can take anywhere from 1&ndash;3 hours (depends on how focused you are) and then there are 3&ndash;5 problems on the PSET. <br/><br/>Teaching staff: The instructors are very nice, funny, and supportive. I had something that made me take a nosedive in the second half of the semester, and the instructors were understanding and helped me get back on track. The TFs are great. They know what they are doing, and they staff really long office hours that you can drop by whenever. The lab TFs are also very helpful during the lab times. <br/><br/>Resources: There is not a shortage in resources available. For exams, not only do we have practice exams and solutions, but we also have a walkthrough video that we can watch. I think that is incredibly helpful because sometimes solutions don&#x27;t show the thought process of how the answer was found. If given the option of online and in person section, I think it is better to take the in person section. I took the online section, and what I realized was that if I had questions, I couldn&#x27;t get them answered in the moment.<br/><br/>Lab: There aren&#x27;t too many lab sessions during the semester, and while the block is like three hours for lab, I don&#x27;t think my partner and I ever used up all 3 hours. That being said, the labs aren&#x27;t always in line with what we were learning in class. There was a bit of a focus on understanding validity&#x2F;accuracy tests instead of the actual physics concept. The guides make the lab easy to follow, and for anything we don&#x27;t understand, lab TF is always there. <br/><br/>Basically, great intro physics class.  Good if you want something low key. Resources are everywhere. It&#x27;s just a matter if you have the time and energy to use them. Professors A+++++, and TFs are great as well.  Exams reflect what is learned in class.</td>

This class changed that&ndash; I learned a lot of new applications to formulas&#x2F; concepts, and real life scenarios that were really interesting to work with. PS2 also has super supportive instructors; Greg and Anna are incredible lecturers and super kind in person as well; their energy encouraged my attendance in class, as I&#x27;ve definitely fallen asleep in other 9am courses. I&#x27;d say PS2 is a pretty well&ndash;structured course with a schedule that&#x27;s not too overwhelming. There&#x27;s an online part and paper part to the pset; as long as you start at least like 2 days before, completing them is not too difficult, and office hours are also super helpful for the paper part. The lab component was also not bad; again, the staff are amazing. I went in with no coding knowledge, so it was really fun to begin my experience without worrying about getting docked for doing something incorrectly&ndash; a TF is always there to help. You get to do decently interesting experiments, but the main point of them was basically to expose you to some Python and statistics concepts. Finally, the exams were unsurprisingly my least favorite part of class, but even then, they could&#x27;ve been a lot worse. They allow you to do a group exam afterwards to help boost your grade, and the graders seem to be as understanding as possible with minor mistakes. They also let you have a cheat sheet, and just the process of making that can help you learn a lot. If you have a difficult schedule, PS2 won&#x27;t be a &quot;do it on the weekend&quot; type of class, or one you neglect until the exam; it still requires time and effort, but if you manage it well, it&#x27;s a pretty good physical science class for premed requirements or if you need it for other fulfillments.</td>

They work really hard to make labs less stressful, which is awesome. The lectures are frustrating because they use an active learning method where every class is problem&ndash;solving. There is little no lecture or explanation, and that was also a tough transition for me. If you have recently taken a physics class recently, you will succeed in this course. It&#x27;s a fairly reasonable pre&ndash;med requirement, and a lot of the kids in this class are also only taking it for pre&ndash;med requirements. The exams are tough, but there&#x27;s a group portion that boosts your grade. They added a surprise lab project  in November, which felt unnecessary. t</td>
