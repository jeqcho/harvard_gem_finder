You will learn a lot about how historical changes have shaped English. There are also lots of guest lecturers that talk about related concepts that they specialize in. A lot of the guest lectures are about how different cultures use and experience English. The workload is not too bad &ndash; weekly readings and exercises, plus a few quizzes and projects that are not too bad, and then a midterm and final exam.</td>

He has a ton of interesting history to share with you, and he explains it very well.<br/><br/>My one complaint is that the homework was pretty unhelpful. The homework exercises were often only tangentially related to the lecture content, so the homework didn&#x27;t help us retain the important material that we learned in lecture and which we later needed to know for the midterm and final. Nonetheless, we still had to do these exercises since we discussed them in section as part of our grade. This was a source of unnecessary stress. Similarly, the textbook was much more extensive than what we learned in lecture, so the readings were often not good at preparing us for lecture since they contained so much material that wasn&#x27;t thoroughly discussed in lecture.<br/><br/>However, I had a great TF and we had review sections before the midterm and final which were both very helpful for retaining the important material. And the graded assignments were graded quite leniently, so the class didn&#x27;t end up being too stressful. For this reason, I&#x27;d still recommend taking it.</td>

This is a hard class because of the material (which is surprisingly complicated and requires lot of memorization), but it is made so much worse because of how the class is structured. It is not set up for you to succeed. <br/><br/>There were way, way, WAY too many weekly homework assignments in this class. Part of the reason for that is because the syllabus&#x2F;workbook we were working from was (poorly) adapted from a different, far more advanced linguistics class. We were given assignments and questions where, when we inquired about how to answer them, were told &quot;oh, you don&#x27;t actually need to know that for this class.&quot; We were being asked questions on assignments that required knowledge that we were never taught and information that we were never given. <br/><br/>Also, for some reason, the TF&#x27;s weren&#x27;t allowed to give us answer keys to any of the assignments that we did, even after they were due. The only way to check your work is to catch everything in section, and there were too many assignments to go over all of them, or if were were able to go over all of them, we couldn&#x27;t go over them in depth. <br/><br/>There was no study guide or proper guidance at all for the midterm or the exam. What was given, was the blank and unfilled the midterm from the other class, the more advanced linguistics class that this class was modeled after, as an example of what kinds of questions could be asked. The problem with that is A) That midterm example was an actual midterm that was given for a different class. B) That class was way more advanced than this class, so the questions were inaccessible &ndash;&ndash; we weren&#x27;t taught the information it was asking for. C) That midterm example gave us no information about the content that would be covered this class&#x27;s midterm. D) There was no answer key for the midterm example we were given. So even when we did fill it out, there was no document to check your answers against. <br/><br/>Please note that the final exam was a closed note, 3&ndash;hour in person final, with 10 thee&ndash;part short answer questions (1a, 1b, 1c, 2a, 2b, 2c, etc.), and two handwritten 400&ndash;600 word essays at the end. On the last day of exam period.<br/><br/>The in&ndash;class review session before the final exam was awful. At the start of the review, the TF said that the entire session was going to be us asking him questions about the exam, and that he would &quot;decide whether or not to answer&quot; our questions.  I recall a student asking a question like &quot;What&#x27;s the best way for us to study for the final?&quot;, and then the TF repeating the question to the class for the class to answer. Then, when the class answered, the TF said &quot;yeah, I mean, that sounds good.&quot; And that was the vibe of the entire review session.<br/><br/>There were several different versions of the international phonetic alphabet in the course materials we were provided, and it was never clarified which one was correct. It created a lot of confusion, and no one knew who was right. Sometimes that&#x27;s okay, but since we are graded on being correct, it&#x27;s not really okay.</td>

I took this course because I wanted to EXPLORE linguistics, and I can confirm that this is not the right introduction to that field. The exams are extremely difficult, and you are often tested on the most minute details. You also need to memorize lots of dates. As a person without a background in Latin, understanding some material was challenging for me but it was not too bad. You are also not taught the foundations of IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet), which you need for the entire course, so you will need to do some Googling and outside learning for that. The projects and guest speakers were pretty interesting, but that it just about the only thing I can say I liked.  I would definitely say this is a higher&ndash;level linguistics course... maybe take it if you are a Classics major or if you have already taken some type of introductory linguistics course and want to learn more about the history of language.</td>

That being said, the main reason I found it so interesting and not too difficult is because I have extensive linguistics background. I can see how a lot of the material and assignments would seem annoying or irrelevant if this is not the background you are coming from. For example, some of the things we had to do were memorize paradigms of Old English pronouns and noun declensions, learn a lot of symbols of the International Phonetic Alphabet, memorize the stages of the Great Vowel Shift and the dates at which the vowels shifted, and memorize a ton of dates related to the English language such as when the first dictionary was published and by who. The class overall was slightly disorganized with unclear expectations about when things needed to be turned in. We would often do 5 worksheets for section only to have one of them be discussed or even relevant for class in the end. Textbook readings were also not too helpful and did not really contribute to me doing better in the class despite the fact that I found them quite interesting. Ultimately, I would recommend this class to you if you are a language&#x2F;linguistics nerd or want a history gened that is not too difficult, but otherwise I would suggest looking elsewhere for a class.</td>

This class has no hand&ndash;holding; there was very little preparation given for the midterm and final, and the entire class (I spoke with multiple people, and they all shared the same sentiment) had no idea how to study for the midterm&#x2F;final other than to basically review the lecture slides, their notes, and read the textbook.  <br/>As a result, take this class if you want to gain a look into the history of the English language in an intellectually&ndash;demanding way and if you love language and like memorizing forms of you and though, the changes of consonants in Grimm and Verner&#x27;s Laws, and memorizing the declension of words such as &quot;stanas,&quot; the Old English word of &quot;rock.&quot;  Do not take this class, however, if you want an easy A with you no stress; this GenEd is definitely doable and will not take over your life, but it is definitely not a gem.</td>
