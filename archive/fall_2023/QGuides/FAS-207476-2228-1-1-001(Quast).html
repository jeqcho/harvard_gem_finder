It will definitely open your eyes to a lot of interesting research and also change the way you view yourself, your interactions with others, and just all of humanity.

Go to the Sunday night office hours for the problem sets; you can just do the problem sets there. You can do well in this class if you make sure you understand all the learning objectives after each lecture&ndash;&ndash;ask questions about things you&#x27;re confused about as you go, don&#x27;t let it all build up.

Whether you are STEM, concentrating in neuro, interested in the brain, or just looking for a stem course to fulfil distributional requirement, this is such a great course. Extremely reasonable assignments and course expectations (assignments accomplish what they are meant to – help you learn material more effectively, WITHOUT tricks or ridiculously hard questions that you can&#x27;t answer based off of material we HAVE been taught, etc.). Cannot recommend this course more. TFs and faculty genuinely want you to do well and want to get to know you too, so do your best to attend OHs just to get to know them better, even if not for questions about the material. Keep on top of weekly assignments, though, since the flipped classroom can sometimes be annoying.</td>

The flipped class&#x2F;video lectures may have been necessary during Covid, but they should have been done away with after last year. The videos made it very hard to engage with content, and made going to in person guest lectures seem pointless. Speaking of the guest lectures, they were often very boring and were either barely or only just slightly related to what we were learning that week. The weekly quizzes were useless and the two projects you have to do aren&#x27;t at all helpful to learning either. I feel like the only way I actually got to understand material in the class was through the psets which were actually helpful in allowing you to apply what you were learning. To do well in this class, just make sure you keep up with the millions of assignments. The material overall isn&#x27;t that hard especially when it&#x27;s broken up into manageable pieces but the volume of work can definitely sink you if you don&#x27;t budget time well.</td>

The first half of the material (about action and membrane potentials, etc.) is challenging and can be intimidating but the second half is much better and more application&ndash;based (about memory, vision, diseases, etc.). You will have to work hard, but the class is worth it. I was intimidated going into this class as a non&ndash;neuro concentrator, but was pleasantly surprised that the material is intriguing and the class is very enjoyable.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_79dbf738-98b0-4737-a17a-7d2bf6f1b939">I would really recommend this class if you need to fill a requirement! It&#x27;s pretty interesting and not too difficult if you haven&#x27;t done STEM in a while. I was scared to take this because I haven&#x27;t studied neuroscience&#x2F;biology since high school, but I felt really confident in the material. It did definitely help that I had taken Psy 1 though and took other psychology classes in high school so I knew a bit about neurons before going into this. Still though, I think they really transitioned you well into this course! Obviously, this could really depend on your TF though, so just be advised. I had Ya&#x27;el and she was AMAZING, so would definitely recommend you take this class and try to get her. This class does have a few more weekly assignments than what you may usually expect (watching like 2.5 hrs of lectures online every week, but you could just put it on 1.5 times speed to get it down to like a bit over an hour per week, a weekly PSET, along with an online quiz), so be ready for that. The quizzes are honestly easy and they are online + open notes, so you&#x27;ll be fine. The PSETs can be a bit confusing, but I realized you can just go over them with your TF for like 5 mins after section and they&#x27;ll be a breeze then. There is a midterm and final exam, along with 2 online tests, but the online ones are open note and the exams in class weren&#x27;t too difficult in my opinion. Having a bunch of assignments in the end did help me feel more confident in my grade, so don&#x27;t worry too much about it. There are also like 2 group projects, but they&#x27;ll be fine, especially if your TF is an easy grader. Overall recommend, though do try getting Ya&#x27;el as a TF because she&#x27;s probably the only reason I really had a good time with this class. (I heard Kevin was also amazing from multiple friends and whenever I interacted with him he seemed super nice, so either of the two!!)</td>

I was unsure before this class if I wanted to concentrate in Neuro, but it has certainly confirmed my interest and passion for neuro. I have never learned more than I did in this class, and it&#x27;s all so interesting to study because everything has really cool applications from diseases like Alzheimer&#x27;s to experiments with owl goggles and cutting off the head of a chicken or drugging a cat and having it still run, to fainting goats and just really cool applications. In section, you do the coolest experiments where you alter your taste buds, literally GET BRAIN CONTROLLED and have your arm move as a result of someone else squeezing their bicep by bypassing your own brain, riding a backwards reverse bike, trying on cool goggles that mess with you vision, etc, etc. The lectures are asynchronous which is AWESOME cause you can watch them whenever and pause to take notes and put them on 2X speed. In person during lecture times, one day of the week you get a review of that week&#x27;s content which is very very helpful and helps you consolidate what you&#x27;re learning, or even better you get a guest lecturer (what they talk about isn&#x27;t on the test) so that you can hear from experts in the neuro field and talk to them every single week (where else do you have that experience??). ALSO, I TOOK THIS CLASS AS A FRESHMAN so if you are considering that you 100% can and I have no prior neuro experience and didn&#x27;t take LS1A along with it. It&#x27;s totally fine to ta If yke it as a freshman. Overall, this class is the best because what you&#x27;re learning about is fascinating, like I literally enjoyed rereading all my notes to study for the final, it was barely even stressful because it was just so interesting to read. If you have any interest at all in neuro, take the class. And if you are taking it, the secret to success is taking notes on all the lectures and going to the PSET solving session Sunday night every time because sometimes they&#x27;re looking for very specific answers that you wouldn&#x27;t just randomly guess that they are, and even if you think you got it, it is always helpful to stop by and ask to check all your answers. If you don&#x27;t know how to do some of the PSET, they are very helpful there and you guaranteed will have it done by the end of the PSET solving session if you really commit yourself to getting it done, even if you come in with it barely started.</td>

Personally, I did not have the attention span to genuinely watch the online lectures (which count towards the course grade), but I found it very helpful to just look at the important slides in the pdf version of the lectures. The weekly psets are fine and take about an hour or two. If you don&#x27;t go to lecture and don&#x27;t genuinely watch the online lectures, you can likely pick up on everything entirely from section. The course is very accessible. The online tests were fine, and the midterm and final weren&#x27;t bad. The course will likely feel like its building slowly, especially when climbing &quot;Mt. Potential,&quot;  but when the time comes to review, you will realize you actually worked through a decent bit of material. After the midterm, you will likely feel like there&#x27;s a bit of disconnect between the first half (Mt. Potential) of the course and the second half (visual and motor pathways, neurodevelopment, diseases&#x2F;disorders, cool experiments), but everything will click into place in the end. Overall, very investing and very well organized course.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_79dbf738-98b0-4737-a17a-7d2bf6f1b939">I think the vast majority of students in this class are here because they have to be here &ndash;&ndash; it&#x27;s a lot of pre&ndash;med sophomores and intense bio kids, which can be a lot. They tried to do a &quot;flipped classroom,&quot; which normally means watching lecture on your own and working on homework &#x2F; problem solving while together, but instead they just make you watch lecture at home and then watch even more lecture in person, which is pretty dumb. There are also a TON of tiny little thingies, like weekly quizzes and problem sets, lots of small tests, midterm and final, two projects... so keeping track of it all can be a lot. That said, no assignment is that important because the grade is made up of so many component parts, so it isn&#x27;t super high stress. Finally, while it talks about behavior, note that the behaviors you will study are super boring &ndash;&ndash; like, vision or motion &ndash;&ndash; not complex human behaviors. Everything you study in this class is something a worm could do, so don&#x27;t get excited about learning about how your brain works in a way that affects your life. Overall, as a philosophy student doing this class for MBB, I thought it was difficult but not impossible, and while it didn&#x27;t have like a fun facts about the brain vibe that I had hoped for, I did end up learning a lot especially in the first half of the course.</td>

While I found myself slip behind on watching recordings as the semester progressed, I really enjoyed not having to sit through in person lectures. It freed up the time for the guest speakers which I thought were great.
