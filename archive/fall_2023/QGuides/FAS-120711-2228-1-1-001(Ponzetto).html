However, it will definitely be challenging at times (especially the modeling projects and the exams), so you should plan to put in a lot of time studying the concepts and working on assignments. The psets are graded P&#x2F;F, which really alleviates some of the weekly workload, but it&#x27;s important to make sure you understand the material and can apply them on the tests.

This class was an emotional rollercoaster to say the least, so if you actually choose to take it please read this in depth review on every component of the class.<br/><br/>&ndash; LECTURES: during lectures you will most likely feel dumb (unless if you’re a math 55 kid or a grad student. Yes, grad students take this class). The only times I felt like I understood something during lecture was when I would read the lecture notes and watch the course videos BEFORE lecture. I only did that for a few weeks, but during that time I felt like I understood something. I attended every single lecture and think I only retained 10% of what was covered in each lecture. That’s how confusing it was. <br/>&ndash; CA LECTURE NOTES: these are incredible. These are summaries of the lectures typed up by the CAs, and could honestly substitute the lectures (especially considering that it was so hard to follow during lecture). Highly highly recommend using these to prepare for the midterm and final, and to do the modeling projects<br/>&ndash; TEXTBOOK: two past CAs for the course prepared a textbook, which was honestly an incredible resource up to the midterm. For the content that was taught after the midterm, the textbook didn’t exactly cover every single lecture, but still highly recommend using this as a primary study resource. <br/>&ndash; PSETS: these are actually insane. They are so hard and you will spend up to 10&ndash;20hrs a week on your first few psets. Then, you’ll realize that they’re so hard that it doesn’t really make that much sense to put that much time into them, and if you write anything that makes remote sense you’ll still get 100 on them<br/>&ndash; MODELING PROJECTS: these were BRUTAL. These could be a super interesting part of the course, and I DEFINITELY learnt a lot during them, but the teaching staff doesn’t have solutions for the modeling projects, so when you go to office hours to seek help, every TF and CA will give you different answers, because “””there is no right model”””.  This was actually brutal, and grades were all over the board on these projects. THE ONLY PERSON WHO WAS ACTUALLY INCREDIBLY USEFUL ON THESE MODELING PROJECTS WAS LUCA. If Luca is still CAing the course, TAKE IT. And go to his office hours. Luca we love you.<br/>&ndash; EXAMS. Actually insane. The median in both our midterm and final was below 40%. Basically, study the general concepts, and write something down for every question. You’ll do better than you think because everyone is so lost in these exams that the median will be so low anyway. Always write something down for the TFUs.<br/><br/>Overall, can anybody take this class? Not really . if you aren’t a math 55 student or a Econ genius grad student, you will need to put a lot of work into this class to even get by with an A&ndash;. Keep this in mind when choosing to take this class. Especially if you have a super heavy course load. <br/><br/>Would I still recommend taking it? Yes, because I learnt a lot about exam strategy, emotional resilience, and modeling. But be careful when taking this class along with stat110: the marginal benefit you would get from studying stat110 for a few extra hours greatly surpasses the benefit you would get from studying a few extra hours for econ1011a. Don’t underestimate stat110 when taking econ1011a because you think ec is so much harder (that’s what I did and I regret it). If after all of this you still choose to take this class, buckle up!! You will make some of your closest friends struggling over psets and modeling projects, and will learn about how to get right above the median while understanding basically nothing of what was taught in the class.</td>

First, I will praise the course:<br/>1) The class covers so much material. You will learn a ton, and it is a very rewarding experience. It is definitely worth the effort if you are interesting in how to model people, firms, agents etc. using math.<br/>2) Giacomo was a good lecturer in my opinion. I really liked the policy discussions because it made me think about a lot of real world problems and how they relate to the class. He is also funny, but humor is subjective.<br/>3) A lot of concepts you learn are very neat. I liked how we taught about heterogeneity using distributions, signaling using hidden types, moral hazard, game theory, etc. Ideas of equilibrium are very nice. <br/>Now, I will talk about the downsides<br/>1) You basically do not receive any feedback on modeling projects. NONE. we got the feedback for the second modeling project at the final exam, even though it was due like 6 weeks ago. Given that the most time you spend on this class is on modeling projects, this is a huge problem.<br/>2) Psets can get very mechanical and instead of teaching you real modeling skills, it tries to teach you how to do computational math. I know this might be an important skill to have as an economist, but I doubt that anyone is taking this class to get better at algebra. I would appreciate more if the psets were directed more towards the learning goals of students.<br/>3) I do not understand what they are trying to accomplish by making the exams extremely hard. The midterm median was around 34, which was an A&ndash;. Above 50 was an A, I believe. Lowest grade was a 10, which was a B&ndash; I believe. The exam was out of 100. A lot of students didn&#x27;t even attempt the last problem because of time constraints, which defeats the purpose of putting the problem in the exam.</td>

A lot of the content and work is so difficult that when you search the internet for help, you&#x27;ll see lectures and slides and papers written for grad student classes. Collaborate with your peers often. Discussing economics with others is the most fun way to do it, and you&#x27;ll learn more this way. The nice thing about Ec1011 is that you must solve using rigorous mathematical models, but you can thoroughly think about the way you want to model and solve before writing any math down. Be prepared to think a lot, therefore.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_24693cad-0b69-42b1-a8f2-9e1f00252d25">I went into this class knowing that it was going to be difficult but unaware that it was going to be impossible. It is definitely the most difficult class I have taken at Harvard, and the most difficult class I hope I will take. I am proud of myself for sticking through it but would not recommend anyone take it. Here&#x27;s why:<br/><br/>Lectures: Every single class, I would sit down in lecture, hoping that would be the day I actually understood something, and that was never the case. Not only do slides go fast, but there is no logical order to them, making it impossible to look away for one second without getting lost.  Lectures then, became insufferable, as it was an hour and fifteen minutes of me feeling stupid. Halfway through the semester, I stopped paying attention altogether. I wish I had stopped going, because me being there did not help at all. The math is also overwhelming; if you have only done 21a and 21b, you will not understand most of what is going on.  What they say is true: the class will be far easier for those comfortable with math than those comfortable with economics. <br/><br/>PSETs: PSETs were incredibly overwhelming at the beginning. I spent upwards of 10 hours on the first one and I&#x27;m sure it was completely wrong, so by the end I would waste no more than 4 hours on each one and still get the 100 (since they are completion based).  Although it&#x27;s a learning curve for everyone, I recommend not fretting too much over them; just do them quickly, and instead spend the additional time going over solutions once they&#x27;re posted. <br/><br/>Modeling Projects: Modeling projects could be the best part of this course but they are somehow the worst. Only the TF&#x27;s and the head CA had solutions, and few actually gave you guidance so it was impossible to know if you were on the right track or not. It felt like we were being set up for failure. However, go to office hours!! It is the only way you will get a semblance of a correct answer, so make sure to go early and try to go through every single part with the group. Alone, you will not be able to do it. Grading on this was also incredibly late, and we got them back on the day of the exam which I felt was cruel.<br/><br/>Exams: Exams are tough but fair. You just need to write fast and try to write something down for every point. You will not know what you&#x27;re doing but the scattershot approach is the best way to ~optimize~ your points. I don&#x27;t think you can prepare a lot for them but just try to have a general idea of what you&#x27;d do for every type of question (e.g. game theory, externalities, aggregate demand and supply) so that you don&#x27;t blank completely on a question.<br/><br/>Staff&#x2F;CA&#x27;s: CA&#x27;s are the saving grace of this course. They know what you&#x27;re going through and will try to help you as much as possible. I know I was able to stick through the course because of them, especially the head CA. However, the class is so tough that sometimes they don&#x27;t even know what we&#x27;re doing. Also, staff doesn&#x27;t help them out too much because they don&#x27;t get solutions to modeling projects. TF&#x27;s on the other hand I often found unhelpful, and their answers just confused and frustrated me more. Professor Ponzetto is amusing in lectures but a bit distant and unapproachable. The class felt intimidating and I don&#x27;t think it was an environment conductive to learning; it was more of a performance where smart people got to show off how much they understood.<br/><br/>Overall, the class taught me a lot about resilience, dealing with failure, and problem solving in general. However, it also tarnished my self&ndash;esteem in academic terms. I left the midterm in tears because I felt so stupid, and every lecture, every PSET, and every modeling project just added to the impostor syndrome. I wish I could say this at least came with a lot of learning, but I don&#x27;t think I actually learned any economics. To this day, I can not tell you what we covered in class, and therefore think I would have gotten much more out of 1010A. <br/><br/>I&#x27;m very proud I took this class but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it. If I could go back and enroll in 1010A, I would. If you end up enrolling, it will be crazy experience and you&#x27;ll come out stronger at the end of it. But please, think twice before doing it and maybe save yourself the trouble.<br/><br/>Also, taking STAT110 concurrently showed me what a difficult but well&ndash;structured class can look like. I don&#x27;t think the material here is that much more difficult but the way it is taught makes it very difficult to learn.  The class needs to be restructured.</td>

The listed math prerequisite for this course is Math 21a, but I think you’ll be fine if you’re concurrently taking it, since most of the multivariable calculus in this course is taking partial derivatives and solving Lagrangians (which are also mostly taking partial derivatives)––which is not too difficult to learn in the first few weeks if you have taken Math 1b. As for Ec 10a &#x2F; AP Micro, I highly recommend you’ve taken these courses, so that you have economic intuition to back your answers, and also because it lets you appreciate all of the crazy math that you will encounter in the course. That being said, you can probably succeed in this class without having taken prior economics, since most of the problem solving involves taking derivatives and manipulating symbols. I also recommend having taken Stat 110 &#x2F; taking Stat 110 concurrently with the course, since the second half of this class relies heavily on probability.<br/>One note of caution: there is a lot of math in this course, but most of the math is quite ugly. Taking derivatives of fractions with 7 different variables is (a little exaggerated) but pretty common in the problem sets and exams. I can take derivatives very quickly now, but it wasn’t a pleasant time acquiring that skill… That being said, the models in this course are extremely insightful and cool––except that solving them is not too fun. <br/>The exams and modeling projects in this course can be quite difficult, with averages of 50%~80% for the modeling projects, and 30%~40% for the exams. But there’s of course a curve, so don’t fret too much if you thought you didn’t do well on the exams. The modeling projects are very vague, and the course gives you minimal assistance for them––so start those early.</td>

More than economics, this class provided me with an exceptionally wide toolkit for modeling situations (economic and not) mathematically and determining what happens when you change particular parameters within the model. In terms of the skills necessary for this class, it is literally just the ability to take partial derivatives at an extremely rapid pace while following some of the economic intuition in the process. The ability to reason through economic situations logically is also useful for certain topics within this course. <br/><br/>The grading can seem extremely harsh, especially for those students who have not taken a quintessential &quot;hard class&quot; at Harvard. With exam averages in the 30s, it can be extremely discouraging to have to lower the barrier for doing well by more than 30&ndash;40 points. However, looking back I would almost certainly take that in exchange for what the class has provided me with, especially going forward. If you are set on a professional route like finance or consulting, this class is probably not for you. For those who would like to struggle through an academic subject and really understand what the world of academia looks like for economics, this is the class for you!</td>

It&#x27;s really frustrating because most people come into this class wanting to learn, but it&#x27;s so hard to do so. That being said, the course material was definitely really interesting (learning how to model crime, voting, etc. which are not ordinarily thought of when it comes to economic modeling).

I&#x27;ll start with the good. I think the variety of topics we studied was nice. I have also come out of this class with some of the basic tools for mathematically modeling and analyzing human behavior. Claire was a good TF, and Luca was a great head CA who answered probably 90% of the questions students asked on Ed. The textbook and CA lecture notes were very helpful. Also, problem sets were generally interesting and helpful for learning the content. <br/><br/>Now for the bad. Most people do the homework 1 or 2 nights before the due date since they are pretty much just graded on completion. I feel like this gets in the way of learning the material well. Note that Ed was gone this year, so we had Giacomo as our instructor. He&#x27;s nice and funny, but his lectures were a bit hard to follow because he is a pretty wordy guy. The modeling projects for this class had potential, but they turned out to be one of the worst parts of the course. Most of the CAs had no idea what was going on with the projects because they did not have any solutions to refer to. Hence, it was very hard to find help for the modeling projects, which was a problem because the questions were often vague&#x2F;unclear.  Lastly, the exams were brutal and not the most reflective of what we covered in the course. My advice for doing well would be to make sure you write down some math whenever possible, rather than just try to answer the questions conceptually. <br/><br/>Here are some stats from the course: the mean for the midterm was 36%, and the mean for the final was 38%. The mean for the first modeling project was 89%, for the second was 71%, and for the third was 50%. I believe to safely get an A, you need to do around 1 SD (slightly below that may be fine) better than the mean on the midterm and final. <br/><br/>With all that in mind, I would not recommend this course if it is not required for your concentration. If it is, then best of luck! It&#x27;s honestly not too much work, it&#x27;s just stressful because of the grading system.</td>

What you have heard is most likely true, from difficult PSETs to low averages on the exam and a lot of uncertainty in between.<br/>However, be wary of how much you actually listen to others. Yes, this class is hard, but the main difficulty is the learning curve at the beginning and adjusting to the math behind the economic theory. Personally, I have no comp math experience, nor am I a Math 25 legend, and it was enormously difficult to adjust to complex derivatives and a lot of algebra. Ec 10 will do little to help you at the beginning. As the class moves on, the math will become familiar, and the economics will get harder. The beginning of the class is intended to break you, but once you get over the midterm &quot;hump,&quot; I thought the class got objectively easier as the economics got harder.<br/>This class convinced me that I want to go to grad school for economics because I ended up just enjoying the content so much (it gets better as the class moves on). Here are a few tips I learned that will make your class experience easier:<br/>Attend 2 sections a week. This will pay enormous dividends when you approach exams since the class covers a lot of content.<br/>READ THE BOOK REGULARLY. This is very underrated, but again, it will help clarify the confusion in course concepts<br/>Spend at most 6 hours on a given PSET. At some point, the math becomes too gross. You are better off checking your answers with the answer key afterward rather than obsessing over small algebra.<br/>Start early on the modeling projects. I ended up spending 40 hours in total on the last (solo) one, but I did very well compared to the class<br/>Midterms and Finals: Grind out the content first, then move to practice problems. For the midterm, be especially sharp on algebra and prioritize that. For the final, I would focus more on content and the modeling setup for the final question<br/>In the end, you will end up loving all of it</td>

They tried to cram too much in too little time, so it became very overwhelming very fast, took all the joy out of learning. The exams are ridiculously hard, especially the midterm which was more of a speed test than an actual exam that tests your understanding. This class gave me so much stress and sucks all the motivations out of me.</td>

I was excited to take it, and I am happy I did, but not because I feel like I came out of the other side a better person, with a broad range of knowledge. In this class you actually see what economic theory looks like, and you realize it is not all it is said to be. I personally feel disenchanted after taking this course, even though, again, I am happy I was able to see firsthand how economic theory goes in all of the big traditional topics. All parts of this class are hard. PSets (but don&#x27;t worry too much about them, they will give you 100), tests, and modeling projects. The best thing you can do is to keep up with the CA lecture notes or the textbook, because lecture will not be enough.</td>

This class consumed my life. Once i stopped caring about the psets <br/>(which for before the midetrm I went to OH to complete) and completed them on my own, my time dedicated to this class was better but not by much. The lectures are extremely poorly structured, hard to follow and there were rare moments where I actually derived anything out of them. The book (up until the midterms), CA lecture notes, CAs and (out of luck, thank goodness) my TF helped me make it through this class. The book covers content only up till the midterm which was extremely useful for building conceptual knowledge but post the midterm, as the content (in my opinion) got harder, that stopped and so did my attempt at trying to better undertsadnd concepts. The CA lecture notes post the midterms were extremely helpful as the slides in singularity are grossly ineffective.  My section was the only reason I could survived this class. My TF  singlehandedly carried the class and paced the sections in an excellent way, ensuring that students have a strong conceptual understanding of the concepts. I wish he could also have that influence on the lecture component of the class becuase if it was possible in sections to make the class appear well structured as he made it, I’m sure lectures could have been designed better too. The psets are unnecesarily hard, the modelling projects were nightmares. The lack of feedback on the same, the openendedess, ambiguity and lack of support (even the CAs did not have access to answer keys) made the projects AWFUL.  I survived the class and want to say that I derived great friendships and (some) apppreciation for the way of approaching economics via math but hoped that the class was better sturtcured for all my peers and I to have had an overall better experience.</td>

Find pset buddies! I made really good friends in this class (bonding over struggling through psets). <br/><br/>It is ultimately a really rewarding class, and I think it&#x27;s one of the classes I&#x27;ve learned the most from.</td>

It&#x27;s the kind where it&#x27;s near impossible to make any progress on the problem sets. That said it is exceptionally rewarding! You will be able to understand any economics paper, you will have a good group of friends you trauma bonded with doing the work, and you&#x27;re going to have a much greater appreciation for graduate level economics.<br/><br/>Go to Claire Shi&#x27;s section because she is actually incredible and go to as many office hours as you can.<br/><br/>Note that all osets are pass&#x2F;fail and so you don&#x27;t get feedback and so often don&#x27;t know if&#x2F;where you are going wrong. <br/>The midterm median was 34% (which is an A&ndash; and most people get an A&ndash;). <br/>The modelling projects (1st one work in groups of 4 &ndash; 5%, 2nd one work in groups of 4 &ndash; 8%, 3rd one work alone &ndash; 12%) are tough. Almost all of the TFs and the CAs do not have the solutions and are a net negative to go to. For our class the projects were monopolized by Luca (one of the CAs) who actually had the solutions and helped us. For the life of me I cannot understand why no one else helped but they are exceptionally tough.<br/><br/>This class is hard work and I almost always felt behind and as if I didn&#x27;t understand anything, except for a couple of absolutely cracked individuals who were chilling, but it is 100% worth it (especially if you are considering a PhD in economics).</td>

It&#x27;s a pain in the ass, and you will need to go to office hours to ask how to do the first problem on the problem set, but if you do it, it will be worth it I think. I took this course because I prefer looking at economics from the Math side, not taking Supply and Demand graphs as given, and being able to critically think about the assumptions that it took to get there, and I was satisfied with that part.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_24693cad-0b69-42b1-a8f2-9e1f00252d25">I think one main strength of the course was being able to provide a fundamental introduction to microeconomic theory and the tools that economics use to understand the world. I have gained confidence in my ability to understand economic problems through the tools and information taught in lectures and the ability to practice and reinforce what we learned through problem sets and modeling projects. I think the course resources and the community in the class are particularly strong. With the CA lecture notes, Professor Glaeser&#x27;s supplemental videos, the textbook, and section notes, I found there were other ways to review the information that helped with my understanding of the material and I found other students and CA&#x27;s to be very supportive and willing to help to one another. There are a lot of office hours to help students. That being said, this class is certainly difficult. Once you understand the content of the first part of the course and the general sequence for how to solve problems, I think the content begins to make more sense. I wouldn&#x27;t say that the concepts are conceptually too challenging, but just that the class takes up quite a bit of time. The Professor goes through the content really quickly in lecture, so I think it is normal that many people do not understand a lot of the lectures, but there are resources to help students understand the content outside of lectures and the practice from the homework and the problem sets are helpful.</td>

Everything is unclear, you get no help, you will have to pull all nighters and consider leaving the exam half way through because you literally cannot start working on any of the remaining questions. You know it&#x27;s bad when you see 50 students staring into the wall during an exam that is supposed to be extremely stressful. The midterm has 3 parts worth 100 points in total. One True&#x2F;false&#x2F;uncertain where you can get 24 points. You will likely get somewhere around 15. Then, there are 2 math problems where each question is dependent on the previous question. To get an A&ndash; on the midterm you needed 31. So yeah, most of us left the exam having answered the true&#x2F;false and tried our best to get a few partial credit points here and there, leaving most of the exam blank because we could simply not do any of the questions. This is a very unfair way of testing. It meant that a few points made a huge difference. One true&#x2F;false question would determine your &quot;grade&quot; on the midterm. There was almost no distribution since everyone left the exam mostly blank. I understand the value in having a difficult exam to be able to differentiate between all students rather than having an exam where everyone gets 100. But this is taking it too far. All the hard work and studying we put in was for nothing since we didn&#x27;t get to show anything that we can actually do. I sat there and had done the true&#x2F;false and then got stuck on question a&#x2F;b on both math problems. I got so mad I wanted to just throw my exam in the trash and leave. so so so bad. It&#x27;s rude. And the professor even seemed to enjoy it when he discussed it in class later. Yes, we get it, you understand this perfectly but there is nothing funny about students feeling miserable and failing their exams. FYI, I think I will get an A in this class simply because I happened to have taken an elective in one of the topics that happened to show up on the final exam a lot. I am also a math concentrator.</td>
