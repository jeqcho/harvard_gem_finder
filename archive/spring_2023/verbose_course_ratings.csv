I thought the workload was really reasonable, but I'm still leaving with a good grasp of basic multivariable calculus. I do worry slightly that this course is a bit less rigorous –– not many proofs in the homework, for example –– so if you do want to get hardcore with math later in college, do consider taking a harder class.

Professor Suo always came to lecture with great enthusiasm and passion for the subject, which I in turn felt while learning in class. I always looked forward to lecture. One of the things I loved most about this course was its particular pedagogy: it focused primarily on ensuring we learned and grew comfortable with applying mathematical relationships to real world examples. While we reviewed history and some theory, the problems and exams themselves emphasized application. Furthermore, I felt that all the quizzes were very representative of our understanding of the subject. Modeled closely after lecture and homework problems, the exams were never an unpleasant surprise and I felt that I not only could prepare well for them, but that I also learned a great deal while preparing for them.

If you hated Math 21b, this course offers a revival for your interest in linear algebra. Instead of being knee–deep in useless material such as linear spaces from 21b, you will instead take a dive into the concepts essential to machine learning and big data. Topics ranging from singular value decomposition, principal component analysis, neural networks (feedforward, back propagation), decision trees, random forests, etc. The material is levels above that of 21b and actually holds usefulness to fields in data science.Beware of the first pset. It is VERY LONG, so please for the love of Larry Bacow start it early, because I guarantee that you will regret staying up until 4am the night before it's due solving eigen–problems. However, the psets afterwards definitely do get better, and the homework help sessions are great for getting them done. The last three psets on neural networks are the most code–heavy out of all the psets. Also, DO THE PSETS IN MATLAB, it will make your life so much more convenient. MatLab literally stands for matrix laboratory, so it's like it was made for this class?!Lastly, I want to talk about the star of the show: Professor Eli Tziperman. Eli is a genuinely kind person to get to know. He cares about his students and whether or not they are motivated by the course. He tries really hard to engage students during lectures with jokes about himself and his family and other amusing topics you will find out (especially during the ODEs part of the course). He really wants you to succeed and have fun with the course, and that is what I love about him. However, lecture can be slow at times, and it sometimes gets hard to understand him. Though, he makes up for it by adding some motivating concepts during class by showing application areas for the concepts being taught. Eli is an awesome person, so definitely GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS and take him out to Classroom 2 Table. Most importantly, figure out how to pronounce his name early on!First lecture, I thought this class had many red flags, including how there was going to a pset over spring break (crazy right?). However, as the semester was winding down, I learned to appreciate the course and the professor plus the teaching staff. I genuinely took a TON out of this course, more than from 21b. This is a class that I definitely recommend! Now, you may be thinking ""this guy might just be smart and overstating the course."" But listen to me, I was definitely NOT one of the smartest students taking the course. I struggled with the psets and quizzes from time to time, and I usually took longer to understand the concepts than others, especially during neural networks. However, this course is great. I urge to you to take it, because like you have definitely heard before, this course is extremely rewarding. By the end of the semester, you will look back at everything and appreciate how useful and fun this course was. So, definitely go to Eli's office hours, get to know him more, and pour some time into understanding the concepts.

Want an A and nothing else? Take AP50a and b. Want to be pushed very hard but learn a lot of physics (and possibly get an A first semester)? Take PS2 and PS3. Want something in between, where you’ll learn some physics and still have a shot an A each semester? Take PS2 and AP50b.This class was the worst class I’ve ever taken at Harvard. I’d rather take orgo again than take AP50a or b again. That’s how much I hated this class. I never really got a chance to learn physics in high school because the physics program at my school wasn’t very strong and I was too afraid to take the class. This class excited me because it felt like a low pressure way to learn physics. This was anything but that. The sheer number of assignments makes it imposible to slow down and learn anything. If you miss an assignment, your focus becomes catching up, not learning. I’m walking away from this class having learned next to nothing. Now, every time I hear the word “physics” I am filled with AP50–related dread instead of excitement. Don’t get me wrong — the course staff are super friendly, knowledgeable and understanding, and they genuinely love teaching physics. The course structure is just incredibly flawed. For that reason, I think that your experience in AP50 comes down to what you want out of the class. If you want an A and you truly have no other desire out of a physics class, AP50 is the class for you. It will be the most tedious A you’ve ever gotten, but do what they ask and you’ll get an A.If you have the desire to learn, that probably will not happen for you in AP50.  You spend hours each week reading the textbook (which most people do not do because it is incredibly dense) and that is how you’re supposed to learn multiple complex topics (by yourself). Then, they suddenly expect you to apply skills that you supposedly learned from the textbook to 3 different assignments and 3 assignment revisions EVERY WEEK (luckily, you don’t need to get the answers right the first time). The problem is that you have no idea what was going on in the textbook, so you can’t really understand what is happening on assignments. All you can do is just enough to get by until the next week, where you do it all over again.  You do this day after day, week after week, until you become so tired and overrun that you stop trying to learn and you just do whatever they tell you to until you get your A. I’m not the only one who feels this way either. Every project group I was in talked about how much they couldn’t wait to just be done with the class.

Want an A and nothing else? Take AP50a and b. Want to be pushed very hard but learn a lot of physics (and possibly get an A first semester)? Take PS2 and PS3. Want something in between, where you’ll learn some physics and still have a shot an A each semester? Take PS2 and AP50b.This class was the worst class I’ve ever taken at Harvard. I’d rather take orgo again than take AP50a or b again. That’s how much I hated this class. I never really got a chance to learn physics in high school because the physics program at my school wasn’t very strong and I was too afraid to take the class. This class excited me because it felt like a low pressure way to learn physics. This was anything but that. The sheer number of assignments makes it imposible to slow down and learn anything. If you miss an assignment, your focus becomes catching up, not learning. I’m walking away from this class having learned next to nothing. Now, every time I hear the word “physics” I am filled with AP50–related dread instead of excitement. Don’t get me wrong — the course staff are super friendly, knowledgeable and understanding, and they genuinely love teaching physics. The course structure is just incredibly flawed. For that reason, I think that your experience in AP50 comes down to what you want out of the class. If you want an A and you truly have no other desire out of a physics class, AP50 is the class for you. It will be the most tedious A you’ve ever gotten, but do what they ask and you’ll get an A.If you have the desire to learn, that probably will not happen for you in AP50.  You spend hours each week reading the textbook (which most people do not do because it is incredibly dense) and that is how you’re supposed to learn multiple complex topics (by yourself). Then, they suddenly expect you to apply skills that you supposedly learned from the textbook to 3 different assignments and 3 assignment revisions EVERY WEEK (luckily, you don’t need to get the answers right the first time). The problem is that you have no idea what was going on in the textbook, so you can’t really understand what is happening on assignments. All you can do is just enough to get by until the next week, where you do it all over again.  You do this day after day, week after week, until you become so tired and overrun that you stop trying to learn and you just do whatever they tell you to until you get your A. I’m not the only one who feels this way either. Every project group I was in talked about how much they couldn’t wait to just be done with the class. At the beginning and end of each semester, the course staff sends out a survey asking us “If you had to choose between learning a lot and getting a good grade, which would you choose?” If your answer is “learn a lot” and you’re depending on one class to teach you physics, this isn’t the class for you.

The assignments were cool but super infrequent and super vague, and while some people did a really cool job when we shared, some people didn't buy in as much which was less enjoyable. I was also really dissatisfied that so much of this content was focused on studio art and essentially way less or even nothing on film and photography and the visual studies element of AFVS, and because of that I felt like my studies were less represented in the class. It also had way too much lecture and less discussion among smaller groups so I feel like I got to know other people in the class less than I would have liked as fellow concentrators.

Other students with covid emailed the professor and the head lab TF about missing a lab and received no response for weeks until the makeup lab section was announced (with less than a week's notice) and they were expected to drop everything and attend even if they had other classes or exams during that time. The attitude towards the make up lab was preposterous; the Head Lab TF said they only offer a make up since it is university policy and if you are unable to do the 4 hour (or more if you missed multiple labs) make up then you get a 0 for that lab. There is also so much hypocrisy and a lack of understanding built into the course policy about dropping problem sets; you can't drop a problem set, you can ""make up"" the point of a problem set since every problem set gives you the opportunity to earn 11 points but they are graded out of 10. This policy is impractical since students can't be expected to get an 11/10 on every problem set or even most problem sets and the graduate student TFs are such hard graders that getting high marks is nearly impossible.  The professor emphasizes prioritizing mental health and yet tells students who struggled on Exam 1 to spend their spring break studying for Exam 2 and is unwavering when students ask for some lee–way when submitting late problem sets. Late problem sets receive 50% if they're late within 24 hours and 0% if they're late after, even if you are struggling due to external factors out of your control and notify your TF about these struggles.

Take this class with Jarad, he creates a welcoming and comforting environment, he is incredibly intelligent and helpful, and he's one of the sweetest professors around. I also learned so much more and appreciated the material so much more taking it with Jarad than my friends did taking it with someone else. If Joy Cho TF's this class again, try to attend her section and get to know her! She's the most joyful, relatable, kind, and helpful TF I've ever had. You should be willing to put in the effort for this class. I spent probably 15 hours a week on this course, which is a lot more than I expected coming in. But I can certainly say that every minute spent was worth it – learning and understanding the material was incredibly rewarding. (The 15 hours might be biased towards the long end though, as I came in with less pre–requisites than required).I can never say enough about how much I love this course, and I can never say enough about how much this course single–handedly changed my academic path. From gaining a deeper appreciation of chemistry itself, I finally decided to change my concentration to something more chemistry–oriented. And from watching Jarad lecture and Joy teach section and help at office hours, I finally realized that what I really want to do is to be like them, a teacher with all their amazing qualities :). Take this class! If you're willing to put in the effort, this class can be the best class you'll ever take :).",0.997,"This class has a lot of potential, but this reiteration of Chem 40 was not it. Jarad is really nice, knowledgeable, and means well, but this class was so disorganized it was almost laughable at times. During the first week of this class, the course staff shared that they 1) didn't exactly know what they planned on teaching in the course, and 2) weren't even planning on holding office hours. The lack of organization was the biggest downfall of the class. And that doesn't even touch the material. Some of it makes sense at surface level and some doesn't, but you are expected to know and memorize literally every detail taught during lecture (and lecture is just 75 minutes of new material, twice a week for an entire semester). There is not enough time to actually sit down and work with the material until you actually understand it. All it was was a few pset problems (that usually had material on it taught on the day before it was due, or sometimes the following week??) and like two problems during section. Otherwise, you are all on your own. Some TFs are hit or miss, too, and would sometimes send me to the unreadable textbook to try and figure out something that could've been explained in 3 minutes. The exams can be impossible too, with questions that make no sense, or tested something that Jarad had mentioned once for like 5 seconds during lecture then never came up again in psets or practice problems. Not to mention, there were never enough practice problems for these tests. All in all, this class was so miserable when it did not need to be. Kids who took the class last year had a much easier time even though the content was still hard, if slightly different. I really wanted to enjoy the class, but I just couldn't. If you're a chem concentrator, there's no getting around it, but I cannot recommend this class at all until some serious changes are made.",-0.9267,,0.0,123126,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Chemistry & Chemical Biology,Chemistry,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Inorganic Chemistry

I'm saying this knowing that the course staff put a lot of effort into organizing the course and improving it over the years, and I appreciate their work. However, the biggest problem I have with PS11 is its underlying teaching philosophy, which is rigid, didactic and does not account for leaning differences. I'm writing this feedback as someone who took this course because I'm genuinely interested in the topics presented. I'm not a pre–med student, but I really wanted to learn about the underlying chemistry behind climate change, energy and batteries (for a potential concentration in MechE). However, the course managed to turn the materials that I'm genuinely interested in into something I dreaded throughout this semester. The reason is because of the absurd amount of requirements and rigidity of the course. Personally, I found the material quite easy. I essentially self–studied 3 weeks worth of course material in the 3 days before every exam and averaged at 97 (for the midterms). The conceptual basis of all the units is pretty intuitive to understand (as someone with an honors chem background in high school), and then the rest of the work is just plug and chug. HOWEVER, this course expects you to spend essentially 3–4 hours every week just doing plug and chug. Add onto this the 2 hour lab sessions, where you essentially transfer a few liquids, write down a few numbers and just wait around. Add onto this MANDATORY lectures and sections, in which I quickly learnt it was more useful to spend my time doing other work (since I could learn the same material in 1/10 of the time afterwards anyways).  The PSETS are long and annoying. You know that feeling when you spend 10+ hours solving a really difficult physics or CS pset and feel really accomplished afterwards? Don't expect to feel the same way about PS11 psets. The only skill you'll be honing is using your calculator. I understand that this is a personal perspective and that there are students who might have appreciated the extra practice and explanation. However, the course should make this extra practice OPTIONAL, and not make all students sit through the grueling sections that they might not need. Personally, I also don't learn well in large, in–person lecture halls, and it's ridiculous of the course to presume that this is the best learning method for all students. If lecture was not mandatory, the students who genuinely benefit from this style of learning can come, and the rest can learn the materials through other methods. As long as they LEARN THE MATERIALS, which should be what matters most. For the course instructors—once again, I really appreciate your work (special shout–out to Lu Wang, I essentially learnt most of the materials through the textbook + your problem solving sections, and the way. you explain things is great). The content is quite interesting, and the general progression of the course neatly links the topics together. However, please seriously consider my above feedback and have more faith in students' ability to decide for themselves how they learn best. If you want students to spend a lot of hours on the course regardless, maybe consider designing more conceptually challenging problems/bonus options, etc. for the intellectually curious rather than having a one–size–fit–all approach. For students considering the course, my two cents is: – If you're pre–med and looking for an easy grade boost (aka you have to put in hours of mind–numbing work but will probably get a good grade), sure, this is the course for you.– If you're genuinely interested in learning the material, just get the textbook and skip this course.

Jim Anderson is apparently a renowned chemist; he should not, however, be a renowned lecturer. Disorganized and unclear, his classes somehow simultaneously assume you know nothing and are a PhD candidate in chemistry. He leaps from topic to topic either without properly explaining any concepts or by explaining the most useless information in minute detail. His style consists of namedropping Tesla a thousand times and underlining or drawing checkmarks next to random information on the prepared slides and never once does this class set out core concepts to understand, appropriately explain the relationships between anything in chemistry and physics, or ask you turn on your brain. Greg is a significant improvement, but his lectures too struggle from a lack of direction and no synthesis of material. The PSETs exist simply to occupy your time — please just find someone who is premed or chemistry and do the PSET with them so you can spend as little time on this class a possible. I never once had to think in this class, you must learn the types of questions they ask and know how to answer them and nothing else.

They tangentially relate to class material and don't teach you anything about actual lab work all while imposing even more arbitrary deadlines and busywork to turn in.

The readings themselves were rich with wisdom and creativity. They were often the lifework of the authors and it's evident that the magnitude of each work goes beyond much of the literature we as students normally read. Each literary work and the connections to one another gave me a much more profound understanding of the world and especially of German culture. I did not expect to learn so much about music theory, religion, etymology, and history but it was a welcomed addition that always elevated our understanding of the texts. Before taking the course, I was only somewhat familiar with the Faust legend. I did not realize how deeply this legend is tied to German identity. It explains Germany's historical journey, and we specifically focus on its connection to WWI and WWII. Moreover, the Faust legend captures something so innately close to our humanity that the questions raised and the works based on it illuminate much about ourselves, our purpose, and how to make sense of humanity's trajectory. I have always loved literature, but this course took it to another level. I felt so transformed by this course and it left me thinking, this is one of those courses you dream of taking. This is a class is the epitome of what makes Harvard an untouchable academic experience. Professor Hamilton is an amazing lecturer –– very humble too –– who can keep you captivated for the two hours we meet each week. Every lecture is like an intricate story that ties together knowledge from all disciplines to explain and analyze the text at a foundational level. It's beautiful to see how literature and the decisions made by the authors evolve from one culture to another, across time periods. I still remember our first class, when Professor Hamilton began by explaining the difference between literature and philosophy. Literature is for you to interpret. It doesn't retain a concrete meaning. It is meant to evolve, and it will connect to each individual uniquely. I have taken philosophy classes before and he is exactly correct. This class embodies an openness to ideas, no matter how unusual or unpopular. Unlike philosophy, literature doesn't have rules nor does it tell you how you should think. The joy and curiosity I thought I would find in philosophy, I actually found in literature.  With every essay, you can feel free to write wherever your connection to the literature takes you and Professor Hamilton is always supportive and encouraging of your interpretations. Sometimes, it felt intimidating to have to write essays after hearing Professor Hamilton's lectures which expertly made connections you can only make with his breadth of knowledge and after spending years ruminating on the literature. I truly was in awe after every class because his revelations about the text and about themes would be things I've never heard or even considered before. Oftentimes, perspectives and interpretations on common motifs are repeated so you hear them in one class and then another. This was completely different, like studying literature for the first time again.Having said this, please view the lectures as an incredible educational experience that should only inspire you to reach to produce your best work in the course. I would encourage you to challenge yourself in finding new connections, still, or ones that weren't touched on much in class. It's not easy, but it will be rewarding when you prove to yourself that there is no ceiling to literature. No matter how much you think you have learned and understand, there's always more to discover. Interestingly, the course structure doesn't appear to be heavy on workload or reading, but the beauty of only assigning work that is necessary is that we have the time to discuss and reflect, reread and do our own research. I spent considerable time outside of class thinking, talking about what I read, and over time that relationship with the text allowed me to make the most of each essay I eventually wrote. The course also isn't a writing course –– it's not meant to nitpick on writing skill/style –– but I felt a natural progression in improving my writing style because the material we wrote about has such gravity to it. I'm left with a greater sense of awareness of who we are and why we do what we do in addition to a deeper connection to humanity of the past and present. This course ultimately made me decide to continue studying literature at Harvard and the lectures and readings are things I will be thinking about, fondly, for years to come. No matter what your background is, if you are curious about humanity, its relationship to nature, and the ever–present balances in life –– if you are willing to dedicate yourself to the readings with care and attention –– I recommend this course with the greatest enthusiasm.",0.999,Take this course.

For those of you who are considering CS50 or CS32, I believe CS32 has a much more natural and supportive method of teaching a beginner how to code. I came into the class without any prior coding experience. For years, I've wanted to learn but there's always been this sense of intimidation in addition to feeling overwhelmed in navigating programming on my own. Your first introduction to coding can shape your entire perspective, so I wanted a course that focused on fundamentals and did them well. I can say that CS32 gave me a solid foundation in python, helped me develop a problem–solving mindset, and gave me a new sense of confidence in my capabilities. Each class focuses on a problem to solve for the day, and we follow along as our professor breaks down the problem and solves it with code. This is not a class that formally teaches syntax. You learn the syntax by doing, kind of like learning a language by living in the country. For me, and I believe for many of us, we really struggled with the first and second pset because there is so much that is new. For instance, downloading python, setting up your computer, and then of course doing the actual coding can be extremely intimidating at first. Please know that this is completely normal, and while it's not fun in the moment, that challenge and discomfort will pay off at the end of the course. Instead of a final test, we have a final project and I didn't see how we would be able to design and solve a problem on our own after 3 months of coding. You'll be surprised because all of your work over the semester comes together in amazing ways in this final project. The final project was a highlight of the course for me. Application is key in learning CS. You won't always understand what's going on in class. You can feel lost, but when you work on the psets, you start to make those connections and by the end of each assignment, you'll have learned so much. For that same reason, a final project directed and made by you is the best opportunity to apply your knowledge and it will be incredibly rewarding to see what you are able to accomplish. Most importantly, the manner in which we learn to dissect a problem is the essence of programming and establishing this mindset early on will put everything into context, no matter how dry or difficult, in the future. Professor Smith and the teaching staff were very considerate of the pacing and they truly tried to give us the time, resources, and encouragement to guide us in this journey. A huge reason why the course was done so intuitively and naturally was because Professor Smith and the teaching staff understood what the perspective of a beginner is like. They eased us into CS and the first pset in a supportive way, and it's sometimes overlooked how important the awareness and dedication to the student experience is. Doing CS for the first time can be scary, but the CS32 staff definitely has the right mindset and will care about adjusting the course to best suit its students. What may surprise you is how much confidence you gain by going through this course. Coding can be frustrating and even the smallest mistakes could cause you to be stuck for hours. When you force yourself to sit there, make yourself understand every line of code, brainstorm different approaches to solving a subtask –– ultimately, you learn to have patience, be resourceful, and you'll see that you are able to solve any problem. Sometimes, it's better to resist getting help immediately because when it's just you and the code, you know you are going to have to be the one to solve the problem. And yes, you actually will be able to solve every problem –– it will amaze you. I went from being intimidated by coding to creating a final project that solves a real world problem on my own. Not just with programming, but in all respects, I have a great sense of confidence in myself because this course pushed me to realize there's a solution to every problem. If you want to learn how to code in a natural, problem–solving approach, CS32 is a great choice. The staff cares about making this transition as painless as possible for you. Focusing on python instead of learning multiple languages eases off the intimidation as well. Overall, if you're a beginner and you want to understand the spirit of programming, this is class will be a great experience for you.",0.9987,"This class is a bit disorganized, though this may be because this was the first semester teaching it. You will be exposed to a lot of new concepts and will learn things but may not get super good at actually writing code on your own by the end of the course. The assignments are pretty low stakes so the course isn't too stressful.",-0.4357,,0.0,219744,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Computer Science,Computer Science,Yes,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Computational Thinking and Problem Solving

CS51 is by far the most difficult class I've taken at this school. Problems I had with this class: 1. Lack of structureThis class only has 5 lectures, and none of them were useful. Literally all they talked about was how beautiful programming is. What does that even mean? Like please I just want to pass this class. Lectures in NO WAY prepared you for assignments or exams. The only time any useful information was given was during code review (section) which is led by TFs, who are literally sophomores. Instead of lectures you would go to lab, where you would be assigned a random partner (this partner changed every week). I do not think this was conducive to learning because a lot of times your partner was just as lost as you so you’re both just sitting there and can’t figure anything out. Then you try to call over a TF and they tell you you’re doing everything wrong. And then you’re like, “How would I have known that?” Guess what. There’s no way you would have known that because the professors don’t lecture.In addition, the textbook for this class is NOT well written. The majority of the exercises provided in the textbook have no answer key, so you have no way of knowing whether you’re on the right track or not. The textbook is also so theoretical. It is very confusing and hard to read. I would say reading 10 pages of that textbook takes around an hour and a half, if you actually want to understand. Thirdly, the grading system in this class was very arbitrary. If you completed the assignment exactly how you were asked to, you would get a 90%. The only way to receive 100% was to code so well that you were on the same level as the professors. Let me ask you, how would I get to that level without ANY real lectures from said professors??2. Impossible examsThere are two exams in this class and I failed both of them. I have never done so bad on an exam before in my life. The sad thing is, when I was taking the exams, I thought I was doing pretty good. However, the way the questions build on each other makes it very easy to get a low score if you mess up the first part of the question. Additionally, some of the exam questions were so vague that I just completely misunderstood what I was being asked to do and as a result received like 0/12 points for that part of the test, even though I was somewhat competent. They release all previous exams to students as study material, but NONE of the previous exams have answer keys because apparently the professor and TFs used to just grade them as they went WITH NO ANSWER KEY. I’m sorry can you literally do the bare minimum and make an answer key to your own test??? Ridiculous.3. No support for studentsAll office hours for this class are overly crowded. Office hours were run from saturday–wednesday, and PSETS were due on Wednesday night. I have major issues with the way CS51 office hours were set up. For starters, we all know the CS department is loaded. Why then, are there only TWO TFs are each office hour session? In LS1b, there are literally 20 TFs staffing one office hour session, and you hardly ever have to wait to ask a question. In CS51 office hours, I had my hand raised on their virtual platform for over an hour before a TF came to address my question, and by that time office hours were about to end. Please hire more TFs so office hours are not so busy. I truly felt bad for the TFs in office hours but at the same time I was so desperate for help that I had to be aggressive and literally beg them to continue answering my questions before moving onto the next person in the office hour line. When we asked course staff to add more office hours earlier in the week so we would have to rush to finish PSETs, they suggested that we simply work on it more individually. If I was capable of working on the pset individually, then yes, this would solve the problem. Unfortunately I was so lost that I actually had no idea how to begin each PSET. Like I’m not a bad student. This should not be happening.One of the more useful components of this class was the Ed platform that people asked questions on.

The TFs do not try to make students' lives easier in any way and the marking schemes are just obscene.The class assignments consist of 7 problem sets and 3 programming assignments. Expect to lose 10% of the points on psets just because you ""were not rigorous enough"" which is alone extremely annoying. After the first pset, you will start including more and more detail into your explanation just to make sure you get the points you deserve but you will continue to consistently get at least 10% off on each pset, thus getting yourself into the absolute mind–numbing conundrum that this class is. The programming assignments are even worse. The coding portions are pretty cool but there is no actual final objective to the task. In the end, you have to ""write a report to summarize your findings."" And guess what—if on that particular day, your mind–reading capabilities are off, you will lose 10% of your grade because you did not correctly guess what was on the mind of the people who wrote the marking scheme. The brutal amount of work that these assignments are feels pointless in the end—not because it was hard and you could not do it, but because it was hard, you did it, and then you lost 10% of your points because the problem statement was inexplicably vague.Finally, exams. Those are really cool. If you feel like participating in the Hunger Games. Honestly, that was my favorite part of CS 124—because it was the only way in which actual understanding of the material reflected on your grade. However, be ready to be challenged. There is almost no time to complete everything, and most of the problems require some ingenuity. The median and mean for both the midterm and the final were 50%. It is a brutal class.

I do expect that there will likely be some level of vitriol over disorganization in the class, etc. and while I think that this class could use work in terms of being a bit better organized, a lot of people in the course honestly just seemed kind of bitter over things that are to be expected in a CS grad class (e.g. literally being asked to come to class). Also the TFs were great! I believe they're seniors so not sure who's going to do it next year, but office hours were so, so helpful. Also, Prof. Dwork is really, really passionate about a lot of these topics, and in the classes where we did discussions, I found it interesting to hear her questions, thoughts, and interpretations. This class is definitely you get out what you put in in terms of engagement with the material, and as someone who could have engaged more, know that now before you take it!",0.994,,0.0,,0.0,214483,Primarily for Graduate Students,Computer Science,Computer Science,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Topics in Theory for Society: Differential Privacy

There was not much flow between lectures and lessons and many times it was not clear how different lectures connected to each other. The problem sets were very long and had barely any connection with what we learn in lecture. Finishing the problem sets required going to office hours and reading the textbook (even then, we never learned the necessary strategies to solve such problems, or were given any examples to work through in class). The project had no concrete guidelines, leaving us guessing as to what is to be expected. Annie and Yash really did the most and were accessible and great. The class overall is pretty chill because there are very few assignments, but I found myself spending 20+ hours on each assignment. If you take this class you need to get started on psets early and go to office hours. I think there were 30ish students enrolled, but from the lecture recording it seemed only 5 people showed up. Take with caution, the material is honestly very cool and interesting, but this class did not generate any enthusiasm for the subject, and I don't think I actually learned much from this class",0.6947,"The teaching is not very good.

The time commitment was fairly chill and Anurag is a very kind professor and always trying to make sure that everyone is understanding the content as much as possible. I never really imagined myself taking a quantum computing class and made this decision on a whim, but the content was really cool and I can really say that I learned so much taking this class. My one issue with the class is probably that it felt like there were more underlying prereqs to the class than expected. While the only prereqs were CS124 and Stat110, it felt as if we zoomed through the physics background that you needed to learn about and I had to spend a bit of time outside class just trying to understand all the notation and all the other basics.

You learn a lot. The evaluative component of the course is fair and low stress (no exams really helps here). The course staff was very receptive to feedback, and provided additional help for students after a difficult problem set 1 really threw  us for a loop. Overall, Roger and the TF's did an excellent job listening to student input. One critique: the late day policy was pretty unintuitive – late days kicked in automatically for assignments worth a negligible part of the grade (BCAs), whereas students had to request late days on psets. The result was that you could inadvertently blow your late days on BCAs. The largest weakness of this course is that it isn't particularly engaging. I felt that the lectures were relatively dry, though I did appreciate whenever Roger tied the lectures to applications in his own research. Sections were more dry, and often it was unclear why exactly we were rehashing a certain topic or focusing in one area rather than others. The projects were pretty fun; I appreciated that students were given flexibility to research their specific interests.  The course gets a little funky and quirky at the end when we talk about ML and Bayesian Statistics, that was cool.

Kim SSN is so funny and talented and makes every class equal parts informative and entertaining. I can confidently say that I had the most fun in Korean Bx + 123xb out of all the classes I took this year.Workload/assignments:The workload can get pretty heavy at times, so if you are interested in taking the class, be prepared for a lot of assignments. Based on my experience, most of the assignments did end up being worthwhile but it can definitely feel like a slog at times. A typical week of assignments consists of 2–3 chapters of grammar homework   (1–2 hrs depending on ur speed) and a couple short essays based on narration passages from the textbook (another 1–2 hours). However, three times a semester you will be required to write a 1.5 page essay and then memorize and give a 5–minute presentation based on that essay. On those weeks, I probably spent between 8–10 hours on Korean outside of class. As some consolation, there is no grammar + composition hw on presentation weeks.Community:I love the community that formed around this class! I found that it was easy to make friends since as Korean Americans we had many common experiences to bond over. It was also fun to have a group of people around the same level as me in Korean who I could converse with on a daily basis. Some of my favorite memories with my Korean chingus this semester were hanging out for an hour before most classes in NW basement and planning a group 노래방 trip together!Preparedness:I would say if you are trying to figure out if 123xb is the right class for you, taking the placement test is definitely the best option! After you get your initial placement, you can schedule a follow–up meeting with one of the Korean professors to get a better idea of where your specific reading, writing, and speaking skills fall relative to the classes. My one note for 123xb and the heritage track in general is that since most of the students speak Korean at home, they will be able to process and speak and process the language pretty quickly and comfortably even if their grammar isn't 100% correct.",0.9968,,0.0,,0.0,161278,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,East Asian Langs & Civ,Korean,,None,,Lecture,Intermediate Korean for Advanced Beginners

There is also a reading presentation that is longer than the final presentation. Given all that, the homeworks all had a purpose and really made me practice Korean every day.

My relevant background includes Math 25a  in the fall and AP Econ in high school. First, I think that Ec 1011b is more of a math class than an econ class; most of the class focuses on manipulating mathematical models of the economy using algebra and taking derivatives. For the level of math required, Math 21a is recommended, but it should be doable without knowing any multivariable calculus because almost all of the calculus in this class is taking partial derivatives (I personally took Multivariable Calculus simultaneously with Ec 1011b, and was fine even though I used partial derivatives in econ before I learned about them in math). But math is a central component of this course, and expect to do a hefty level of math. However, the thing with the class being mathy is that you can get away with a good grade without having much of an economic intuition for the models; aka you can do fine without understanding why certain things are true about the models (ex. why is this investment function decreasing with interest rate?) I personally had this issue in the beginning, so if you find yourself being fine at the math but not really understanding why you're doing the math, I recommend reading the textbook and asking your TF/Prof for intuition. They are very helpful, and make sure to ask very basic questions even if you think you'll look stupid (because you won't look stupid, actually), especially if you didn't take Ec 10b (I asked a lot of these). Having a strong econ and math understanding of models will make you appreciate the things you learn in this class WAY MORE, and I think you'll find econ to be super cool :)",0.9891,"This was a really rough class; lecture was often confusing and chaotic, with several errors in slides. Section was helpful, but could also be extremely confusing if derailing questions were asked. Problem sets were not nearly as challenging as exams (the first exam was so hard that the grading distribution of the class had to be changed in the middle of the semester). Mathematically, I don't think it is that difficult, but the presentation of the content makes it seem much more confusing than it is. Coming from a 1010a background, I missed Boycko's clarity; you'll have to put in a ton of time outside of class just to understand what is going on in the models (but the math in the models is not too hard). Also, way too much time was spent with the head TF hating on the professor, and the professor hating on the head TF; the focus should be on the economics....",-0.9749,,0.0,120172,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Economics,Economics,,Social Sciences,,Lecture,Intermediate Macroeconomics: Advanced

Time and reflection, though, cooled my stance. While this class certainly *covers* relevant topics, I don't really feel that I deeply *learned* them. I am going to have to supplement this course with significant amounts of outside reading to really feel qualified to engage with these topics as a researcher.The root cause of this, in my opinion, is the extreme heterogeneity of technical background in the course: some students have significant quantitative background (multivariable calculus, coding, probability and inference), some have a mix, and some have little to none. This is completely fine, and natural, to expect in a graduate school; the issue arises when everyone is required to take the same course. The result is a class that iterates through the material in fits and starts, never really diving deep enough into the concepts to develop a strong understanding. I thought that Econometrics I in the fall did a better job of applying graduate–level quantitative skills, perhaps to the ire of some participants, but it allowed me to walk away with a better understanding. This course often felt like an undergraduate course a la Econ 101: lots of handwaving, statements like 'trust that this works' and qualitative questions meant to trick you instead of truly testing your understanding. I know that the natural fix – splitting this into two tracks – is complicated, but I'm not sure how to improve the course otherwise. Ultimately, I would not take this class unless you are absolutely required to, which, unfortunately, you might be.",0.9851,,0.0,,0.0,205523,Primarily for Graduate Students,Economics,Economics,,Social Sciences,,Lecture,Econometric Methods II

(1) Go to section. Section really helped me clear up all confusions I had during lecture, and it was a really good resource to help me consolidate material from the past week. If you pick a section, try to choose a section earlier in the week so that you have the content fresh in your mind when you're doing your pset throughout the week (our psets were due on Fridays and I had section on Tuesday). (2) Collaborate with others. Working with others, whether it be during OH or outside of class, will help you clear up any misunderstandings of the material and will help strengthen your grasp of it. So really recommend. (3) Ask help of the TFs. The TFs really made the course not sucky, and they are there to have open conversations about the material, final projects, and performance in the course. If you need any help, reach out to them and it will be worth it. (4) Continue giving feedback.

However I think people who don't like math will be less enthusiastic about the course from what I heard from my classmates. It is one of the less popular electrical engineering cores. Nonetheless, this class teaches a lot about systems and it is a good thing that EEs have to take it. Go to lecture and office hours and you'll be fine.

Her feedback and especially her takes on the excellent assigned readings are thoughtful, insightful and deeply socially conscious. Pretty busy semester as we wrote a poem every week, workshopped 6 people a week (you write a poem every week even if you’re not up for workshop, but Professor Smith writes comments on all of them every week), and wrote two primary reader letters for peers each week, plus keeping up with assigned readings, which we discussed for the first half of the 3 hour workshop. As a result you get a ton of experience reading and writing poetry but it can be a bit draining and the 15 minute slots for workshopping each person felt quick (I’m sure this could change in later years or even within a semester with student feedback). But because Professor Smith wrote feedback every week and you wrote and received two full feedback letters every week, you end up with like a dozen heavily feedbacked poems, half which were discussed in class, which is awesome. Overall a great course to explore documentary poetry, and the assignments are varied and you can write whatever you want (she doesn’t expect you to follow the assignment prompts exactly if you don’t want to).

As I age and mature, I find myself a little less pliable, elasticity slowly bowing to rigidity. And yet, this class was a belonging space for me and a resounding one at that. In my PhD program my writing had been everything but handled tenderly. I’m under no delusion that my writing doesn’t need work; however, I’ve never been in a space where we are so strongly encouraged to find the good, the cors and to make a piece the best version of itself not your best version. Academia has largely severed my connection with writing although it was my lifeblood as an introverted child working through what I now recognize as trauma. I’ve gradually lost my connection to the sustaining power of this art, compounding my pain. This class has begun to mend that relationship. It’s forced me to see the good in my own work. It’s pushed me to offer myself the same tenderness that I seek to offer others.Within the first few classes, if not the first class, Meng was able to invite us into a space where not only were we affirmed, but so too was our writing. The writing exercises early on both excited and intimidated me. Watching the ink spread on my page gave form and life to my ideas. So many of them have gone untilled, unattended that it seemed impossible to ever watch them flower and fruit. Within the greenhouse of our classroom, as I released my cors into the atmosphere and so did my peers, our gifts collided, thickened, and nourished us all. I’ve learned so much from this class. Let the erotic lead you to the “I.” Continually asking myself, “what comes through the hole?,” diverging from tropes and detouring from the paths our minds try to take us for a more excellent way, and, of course, “tell, don’t show.” But even beyond these, the hardest lesson Meng has taught is the importance (and challenge) of writing the good. the beautiful. the delightful. I must admit, this is a lesson that I will be learning for the rest of my life, but it’s one of which I’m beginning to appreciate the value. I really needed this class. It has done more for me than I can adequately express. Thank you, Meng, for the invitation to join this class and thank you for bringing such an amazing course concept to life for each of us.",0.9966,,0.0,,0.0,218853,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,English,English,,Arts and Humanities,,Workshop,Fiction Workshop: The Good Stuff

The structure of the class was to bring a prepared question to class and that will be the jumping off point for discussion. So often class was just talking about random (although interesting) things that weren't always super central to the text.

As a dense stem major who thought that writing 2–page papers were nearly insufferable,  I came into expos resigned to the pain this class would cause me for the entirety of the spring semester. I accepted the hit to my GPA and that I was about to endure and just hoped for the best based on the topic and q guide scores. BOY WAS I WRONG. I left this course fully prepared to change my major to either English or comp lit because Dr. Gold is such an incredible teacher and will genuinely help your writing. Her comments on drafts are thoughtful and useful and she is SO supportive if you reach out for help. She wants you to succeed and to make you a better writer and IT SHOWS. The class itself is as enjoyable as it could be. Some classes are spent discussing readings and the people this class attracts (by nature of the topic) make the discussions insightful and inclusive and will make you want to participate. The classes when you go over the technical parts of writing are expectedly less interesting but Dr. Gold is such a wonderful person to be in a room with and does care about communicating the information so these classes are not that painful to sit through (and most of the time we did activities that allowed for social interaction which was maybe marginally useful for understanding the material but engage with the info in the Gold Guide (which is goated btw) if you tune out during lectures. The class is a fun experience even if you hate writing or struggle with it –– it was my favorite class this semester. Even if you aren't really sure if you have much to say on the issues of feminism and WGS, the research paper is super flexible and you can write about just about anything related to social justice or activism or social media or art –– not everything is about gender specifically in the class and it touches on broader topics of activism that are enlightening. I thought I hated writing (which I still lowkey do but I think everyone hates writing on some level) but this class has made me love it in a strange way and once again (because it can't be said enough) Dr. Gold is an incredible preceptor. Do not be stupid and do take this class. Take this class even if you are not a woman or don't feel you fully identify with the me too movement/experiences because the class is so much more than just social issues. If nothing else take it for Dr. Gold.

It is the worst course at Harvard, sustained only because it is a requirement, and no matter who you are you will almost certainly hate it. It is very possible that it will make you hate Harvard as a whole, and potentially hate yourself too. Expos teaches you nothing useful about writing, it only makes you jump through the arbitrary hoops that the writing program has laid out. The assignments bear no resemblance to any sort of academic writing that you might actually do, unless you are an English concentrator. The first two papers are literary analysis papers, while the third is a research paper in which you do no research, instead you simply compile other people's ideas into a trite synthesis of their research that you must then claim contains your own original contribution. This class in no way achieves its goal of improving people's writing.That being said, since you are forced to take it, this is among the less bad sections to be in. Eliza is a really nice person, and a fair grader. While Expos teaches you absolutely nothing useful about writing, some of the readings in this section are moderately interesting.

I'll give a rundown of why you should take this course.For ppl interested in gov/law/sociology/anything related to this field: as someone who was interested in pre–law yet also severely lacking in knowledge about conlaw, this course was so engaging and interesting. Ross strikes the right balance between making sure the basics are covered about differing theories of interpretation, the general facts of landmark cases, etc. but also providing nuanced views/takes about cases. There are some in our class who clearly know a lot more about US law/conlaw than I do/most people, and Ross both speaks to their level of understanding but also by no mean forces the class to operate at their level of understanding. The course, I think, sparks interest in law at all levels.  I also appreciate that the law we learn is not insulated or theoretical, he also makes sure to tie it very closely to real–world events and current events. For ppl who don't care about law: despite the fact that we will reading exclusively written court opinions on cases, every discussion we have on a case is related quite explicitly and meaningfully to non–law topics (policy, race, sociology, history, gender, technology, science, etc.) . The final essay project gives you freedom to not be restricted to a legal or constitutional–history analysis of cases. It could be a gov/policy–type paper, it could be a paper about, it could be a sociology or philosophy type paper, etc. The cases are wide–reaching in their impacts, and if you want you can totally use them as gateways into less law–restricted papers.  The other papers we do before the final paper are not as generous in their scope, but they also definitely do not need to be law–analysis papers. (think more like an english/history paper where you analyze the author's biases or theories, etc.)For ppl who care more about writing skills: Ross is a preceptor who genuinely cares about your writing skills. He makes himself as open as possible to read theses/arguments you send him over email, to schedule extra conference/OHs, etc. He puts a lot of time into giving very specific and follow–able advice for your first draft, and he also ensures you get a conference with him after. Despite the intense focus on law, you also aren't restricted at all (or even encouraged) to learn to write like a legal analyst or gov concentrator. I think that because we aren't reading novels or essays that we are often more accustomed to from high school english classes and because we are given a new kind of writing (SC opinions/case writing) that is new to us, the course really pushes you and helps you find writing skills (analysis, communication, developing arguments, etc.) that help you in any kind of writing that involves convincing a reader. Ross cares more about understanding your audience, developing arguments that work and don't work, and understanding authorial/your own biases–––which are all applicable no matter where you write. I think it may be pedagogically better that we were forced to use different texts that we were used to so that we weren't limited to following formulaic, discipline–specific habits (like a high school English analysis paper) so that we could think more consciously about what we're writing and why we're writing. For your final paper, depending on what field you want to place your essay in (legal analysis, polisci, history, more literature–based, scientific, philosophical, etc.), Ross will help you craft your writing style/arguments to something that is more suitable for those fields too.

The amount of non–essay assignments are limited, honestly (which I like). Ross isn't an easy grader per se (like he won't instantly give everyone As on your first assignments), but as long as you keep in communication with him you'll do fine.

David is a caring, thoughtful, and very professional preceptor, and runs an organized class with a professional, academic tone. However, he is still very easy to talk to and is obviously invested in our development as writers. In Unit 1, you read the Saga of Laxardal (an ancient Icelandic saga), which I quite enjoyed, but you must be prepared to actually read it and dive into it. It is definitely **old** (written in the 1200s) and can be a bit of a drag at times, but if you want a solid essay you must commit to reading it. However, the quantities of reading are very reasonable and if you're actually invested in the plot, then the essay and class discussions will be engaging and fun. Unit 2 is centered on the show Finding Your Roots (very fun to watch in my opinion) and lens theory. This unit generated some interesting discussion, and there wasn't really much work outside of class for it, but was definitely the least engaging of the three. In Unit 3, you pick your own research topic, so I would recommend finding a book or TV show that you really enjoy, and then the paper will be quite a breeze to write! If you've never done research or used Hollis before there are some in class sessions about it; though if you have, then it will feel very redundant. Overall, the workload for this class was quite low––outside of the essays, there was maybe 18–25 hrs (just a guess) of additional work for the whole semester (like writing response papers, reading, etc.). David gives great feedback on the essays, and I would definitely recommend meeting with him one–on–one to discuss your work. In my experience, he was very clear about what he wanted me to change, and it worked out well for me. The downsides of the course were few. There were times that I didn't feel discussion was that engaging; I think there was potential for us to have really interesting conversations and the vibe was often very academic and stiff. However, if you're considering an Expos, I would definitely recommend Family Sagas!",0.9979,,0.0,"This expos is an highly underrated gem!

Not many people rank this section highly in their Expos ranking survey, I think because it's more rigorous than other sections, but I'm really glad I ended up in this course. First, the readings are awesome. My friend once asked me what we'd read so far in my expos, and I started saying ""Plato, Gandhi, Kant, Rawls, Arendt, Thoreau, Malcolm X..."" and another kid turned around and asked what class I was talking about, and I said ""Expos,"" and he was like, ""WHAT?  How is that an Expos class?"" Seriously, the readings here are I think way more canonical and cool than those you'd do in most other Expos sections. Second, Ben is totally awesome. He's not exactly the person who's going to rally the troops for battle, or get you super excited about philosophy if you weren't already, but he's extremely smart and clear–thinking. His commentary is spot–on, he's a great discussion leader, and his comments on paper drafts are really thorough and useful. I never felt like anything he asked us to do was a waste of time. He's clearly thought a lot about good pedagogy, and that really shows in his course.Expos is something you simply have to take, and you can't get out of it. One way to deal with that fact is to put in as little effort as possible so that you can spend more time on things you want to do. But another way to deal with it is to accept that, if you have to do Expos, you might as well work hard on your papers and try to get a lot out of it, and if that's the approach you want to take, this section is for you. I feel like a much better and clearer writer thanks to this course, and especially Ben's guidance. I'd strongly recommend Civil and Uncivil Disobedience.",0.9978,"I would tell future students in this class to do all of your reading beforehand, and more than that, create a summary sheet where you note the main argument and premises of the text that you read for that class in an extremely structured and concise way. It will help you massively not only in the context of the discussion, but also when writing your response papers, as there is an expectation for you to be extremely rigorous in the way that you deconstruct the arguments you are critiquing/ extending. I would also recommend you discuss your paper ideas with the preceptor prior to writing them, perhaps in office hours, as he is extremely good with offering ideas, and making you question aspects of your argument.

I think it’s fair to say her colleague was right. Never in my four years at college have I experienced a lecturer that is so disorganized and difficult to follow. I like to pay attention in all my classes, I tried, fervently, to do that in this class. It was impossible. Rinard begins every lecture well, for the first two minutes or so: That's when the first aside about her son, her obsession with beans, or whatever her husband is writing begins. Every single lecture has been fragmented with these unnecessary asides with information about her personal life. It's not that I'm cruel and don't care about any of the things that make her human, it's that I can't learn if every 2–3 minutes she disrupts the flow by telling us a story that is only marginally related at best. And, even then, maybe I'm giving her too much credit: even when she had a long period without interruption (in this class that would be roughly 8 minutes), it was still difficult to follow what she was saying. It's clear she puts no time into planning her lectures and making them easy to digest. I imagine that her ""preparation"" for lecture is sitting down for 15 minutes, bulleting down anything that comes to mind when she thinks about the reading, then deciding that she might as well just lecture it in whatever haphazard order she came up with it in.And then, of course, comes the issue of the materials. I read through every single assigned reading, sometimes more than what was assigned. To be frank, the reading list was very interesting and I was constantly intrigued by the ideas put forth. But, I have this inkling that she has not read more than a third of the readings she assigned herself. Throughout lectures, she would make vague counterarguments to the readings that show she clearly has never engaged with some of the readings. I wonder if she looked up book summaries instead. Then, of course, she would often portray the ideas she disagreed with as uncharitably as possible. If it wasn't written by Dan Haybron, it was probably hogwash, and she'll try to convince you of that by shaping the argument to be something it never was. This wouldn't bother me as much if I didn't get so excited to learn more about the readings after reading them. Imagine taking a GenEd thinking you just have to get by, finding yourself intellectually stimulated then wanting to learn more, then having the professor continually prove she does not know what she is talking about and likely knows less than you if you did your reading closely.Overall, do not take this class. If you're interested, I'd recommend skimming the reading list and making use of it yourself. Professor Rinard does not make it an enjoyable learning experience whatsoever.",0.9832,"this course was boring and not related to happiness at all. The professor literally said on the first day, ""this course will probably make you more unhappy, at least while you're taking it."" Don't do it to yourself.",-0.8083,"This class is relatively EASY, but BORING! if you want to take a class where the professor talks about her children 25% of the class, then this is the class for you. I think the average mention of kids per lecture is 10. this does not include mentions of other family members, friends, boring stories with no relevance to the subject, or attempts of jokes. The class might be a gem in terms of easy assignments, if you do well on the short papers and put in some effort, it should be an easy A. But is it worth it? the material is not enjoyable and the lectures consists of the professor just talking for an hour and fifteen minutes, once every other lecture she wrote something on the blackboard, but not a single picture, presentation, or anything that made it easy to follow and engaged. I would rather take a more demanding class than Happiness, which did not fulfill my expectations (which was fairly high).",0.9509,218240,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,General Education,General Education,,None,Ethics and Civics,Lecture,Happiness

I actually took it as an elective, and enjoyed it.

Aside from exams however, the rest of the course was really quite good. Weekly labs were actually on the interactive side in terms of GENEDs, and lab assignments were generally pretty easy (good to work with others though). Most importantly though, the takeaway concepts I gained from this class were what really made me enjoy this course. One of the fundamental messages this class illustrates is that we've been accustomed as a society to treat the symptoms of diseases that arise from mismatches between what humans have adapted to historically versus the starkly different environment most of us now live in (very sedentary lifestyles, extreme abundance of food, etc.). Crucially it has taught me how effective and vital disease prevention is, and has motivated me to stay active and maintain a healthy, balanced diet even more so than I already had.  Lastly, if you're interested in archaic human species, or the evolution of humans in general, as well as how humans differ from our ape relatives (and why these traits were selected for), this class is certainly a good overview of that.",0.9971,"This course is not treated like a GenEd.

Mainly, there are a lot of readings, although the readings were really interesting. I think the class is interesting and informative—and, in particular, relevant—but it is a time commitment, and I think you should take it pass–fail if you are interested. I had trouble completing all the readings with my STEM schedule, so I was quite often stressed during lectures to be cold–called and section to make a meaningful contribution (attendance and discussions are graded). The Professors and Teaching Staff are knowledgeable and engaging, and I learned a lot from this course on US–China relations as it relates to the current state of affairs, but I would have taken this class pass–fail if I could go back. Also, be prepared to do a lot of public speaking in addition to a lot of reading—this course is heavily discussion–based. The assignments at the end of the course are extremely interesting and meaningful, as I learned a lot from my final essay and debate. But, the work is also concentrated at the end of the semester, so be sure to start early and budget time closer to the end of the semester if you choose to take this course.

Only a super strong love and appreciation for the class material will get you through the dry periods without hating the course and its busy–work assignments. So, if you have a strong interest in Korean history, then I cannot recommend this class enough. The course is fantastic. The readings are informative and thoughtful, the movies are good to watch, Professor Eckert is a decently good lecturer, and Sungik (the TF) was phenomenal. This class completely changed the way I understand Korean politics and Korean culture, and it changed the way I understand the history of East Asia and the legacy of that history in the region today. As a Korean–American, the class also changed the way I understand my family and the struggles my family went through during the 20th century. It was really an amazing history course.

I recommend it if you're looking to get an easy A, but if you're genuinely interested in learning about human trafficking, I did not feel that this year's course format was very conducive to that. The lectures from Prof. Patterson were great, but I found the sections a bit of a letdown.  While Patterson's lectures covered human trafficking related topics and incorporated philosophical questions about the nature of trafficking/how we should address it, Ben (my section leader) pretty much only discussed big picture ethical questions. As someone who took the class to learn more about human trafficking, this was disappointing, especially because Ben frequently went on tangents and seemed pretty disorganized overall (he sometimes blatantly blamed delays on exam logistics, etc. on Professor Patterson which was also odd and slightly disrespectful?). We only received section assignments 3–4 weeks in the semester (very late relative to other classes), which forced me to rearrange my work shifts.I was also in an Engaged Section. We did no actual “engaged” work with a nonprofit or human trafficking–related org until very late in the semester (mid–April) when we began working on final projects. Aside from the late start date, I really enjoyed my Engaged Section project (with HEAL Trafficking). It was led by an undergrad who was very organized (especially relative to Ben) and clear about her expectations. I wish we had had more time to work with her and HEAL.

The readings themselves were rich with wisdom and creativity. They were often the lifework of the authors and it's evident that the magnitude of each work goes beyond much of the literature we as students normally read. Each literary work and the connections to one another gave me a much more profound understanding of the world and especially of German culture. I did not expect to learn so much about music theory, religion, etymology, and history but it was a welcomed addition that always elevated our understanding of the texts. Before taking the course, I was only somewhat familiar with the Faust legend. I did not realize how deeply this legend is tied to German identity. It explains Germany's historical journey, and we specifically focus on its connection to WWI and WWII. Moreover, the Faust legend captures something so innately close to our humanity that the questions raised and the works based on it illuminate much about ourselves, our purpose, and how to make sense of humanity's trajectory. I have always loved literature, but this course took it to another level. I felt so transformed by this course and it left me thinking, this is one of those courses you dream of taking. This is a class is the epitome of what makes Harvard an untouchable academic experience. Professor Hamilton is an amazing lecturer –– very humble too –– who can keep you captivated for the two hours we meet each week. Every lecture is like an intricate story that ties together knowledge from all disciplines to explain and analyze the text at a foundational level. It's beautiful to see how literature and the decisions made by the authors evolve from one culture to another, across time periods. I still remember our first class, when Professor Hamilton began by explaining the difference between literature and philosophy. Literature is for you to interpret. It doesn't retain a concrete meaning. It is meant to evolve, and it will connect to each individual uniquely. I have taken philosophy classes before and he is exactly correct. This class embodies an openness to ideas, no matter how unusual or unpopular. Unlike philosophy, literature doesn't have rules nor does it tell you how you should think. The joy and curiosity I thought I would find in philosophy, I actually found in literature.  With every essay, you can feel free to write wherever your connection to the literature takes you and Professor Hamilton is always supportive and encouraging of your interpretations. Sometimes, it felt intimidating to have to write essays after hearing Professor Hamilton's lectures which expertly made connections you can only make with his breadth of knowledge and after spending years ruminating on the literature. I truly was in awe after every class because his revelations about the text and about themes would be things I've never heard or even considered before. Oftentimes, perspectives and interpretations on common motifs are repeated so you hear them in one class and then another. This was completely different, like studying literature for the first time again.Having said this, please view the lectures as an incredible educational experience that should only inspire you to reach to produce your best work in the course. I would encourage you to challenge yourself in finding new connections, still, or ones that weren't touched on much in class. It's not easy, but it will be rewarding when you prove to yourself that there is no ceiling to literature. No matter how much you think you have learned and understand, there's always more to discover. Interestingly, the course structure doesn't appear to be heavy on workload or reading, but the beauty of only assigning work that is necessary is that we have the time to discuss and reflect, reread and do our own research. I spent considerable time outside of class thinking, talking about what I read, and over time that relationship with the text allowed me to make the most of each essay I eventually wrote. The course also isn't a writing course –– it's not meant to nitpick on writing skill/style –– but I felt a natural progression in improving my writing style because the material we wrote about has such gravity to it. I'm left with a greater sense of awareness of who we are and why we do what we do in addition to a deeper connection to humanity of the past and present. This course ultimately made me decide to continue studying literature at Harvard and the lectures and readings are things I will be thinking about, fondly, for years to come. No matter what your background is, if you are curious about humanity, its relationship to nature, and the ever–present balances in life –– if you are willing to dedicate yourself to the readings with care and attention –– I recommend this course with the greatest enthusiasm.",0.999,Take this course.

If you enjoy considering the moral questions behind different forms of government and different governmental policy decisions, you will probably appreciate this class. It provides a strong overview of class political theory while also pairing those texts with more modern and practical interpretations. Of note, however, is that the reading load if fairly heavy for an intro class, though the foundational texts that make up the bulk of the reading are all fairly well–known and summaries can be found if you're running short on time.Professor Beerbohm is an excellent professor and a wonderful human, and I would absolutely recommending going to his office hours and getting to know him if you can. The TFs were also very solid when I took the class, and I thought the sections were engaging (though they're bolstered if you have classmates also willing to engage with the material).If you are already familiar with political theory, you will probably find this class straightforward; the reading and writing expectations are not meaningfully different from other classes in the field. That being said, the class is still worthwhile for those experienced with political theory for two reasons: 1) You get to engage with Professor Beerbohm, who is fantastic and has done really interesting work on applied political theory; and 2) The course provides a strong overview of many of the most important thinkers and can help fill in some gaps in your knowledge if you've previously taken more specialized political theory classes.",0.9918,,0.0,,0.0,124414,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Government,Government,,Social Sciences,,Lecture,Foundations of Political Theory

The guest lectures were interesting and some of the content actually really useful from a negotiation perspective (especially the talks by Alexander Hug and Danny Stoian).

Through the negotiation sessions, you also get to know your classmates much better than in other courses. The readings are very helpful and def worth reading, but I often had the impression that it was fine skimming some of it since they are not the main predictor of doing a good job in the negotiation sessions.

In many of the classes we had I felt that the input I got from the class itself was scarce. Where I learned the most was when collaborating with other students on some of the assignments. (You can work on most assignments on your own or in groups of up to three people). For one of them, I worked with an experienced consultant who took the HKS version of the class. Seeing how differently he approached the problem at hand was a great experience. For the other class, I worked with a college student with a CS background, whose R–skills added incredible value to our final project and clearly showed me where I (with my Econ major) need to improve. Apparently, the grading is harder if you work in groups but I would say (though I don't know my final grade yet) that this is totally worth it, especially if you work in groups of two.Prof. Sweeney also has interesting ideas for research during the summer – do make use of this opportunity if you can and if you like the topic of the class.I think the class has huge potential.

It gives you the theoretical foundation to understand how behavioral economic insights (cognitive psychology insights) are and can be used to craft public policy.

The professor is great, and very kind.

But as hard as it is, it will truly make you a MUCH better writer, reader, and historian. And for that, I think it is definitely worth it. It is a very well structured course, that has obviously been developed over generations of students and their feedback. There is a LOT of readings (do them and PARTICIPATE in class!) especially at the first half of the semester but it cools down in the second half where the focus is on writing the final paper. You will do a LOT of writing but it will make you a much better writer. History97 has much more rigorous methdological training than many other equivalent concentration sophomore tutorials in social sciences and humanities. Get started on a final paper topic ASAP – feels scary to decide so early on but it will be enormously helpful. I think the best thing to do is build off an idea from a previous history class you took or a book you've read or some topic of interest/expertise that you are deeply interested in. It will inevitably shift and develop over time but it is good to have a somewhat clear general idea from the very beginning.Prof Blair is incredible! Despite being the Chair of the History Dept and being super busy, she dedicated so much time and effort into teaching us.

It's a great intro course for students who don't know much about architecture. Also, if you go to class (and you'll be in the minority if you do), the class will be a breeze. The exams do require a decent amount of memorization, but the essays are very relaxed and fun. I do wish that the course staff/structure were more accommodating – they automatically sort you into sections without asking what section time you would prefer, and tell you that you're not allowed to switch. I found that to be both presumptuous and unrealistic (plot twist: Harvard students have commitments outside of their classes and can't go to section at whatever random time you assign). They also only provided the recorded lectures to students who reached out with reasons they missed class, and the recording link expired after a week or so. Ultimately, that stuff wasn't that big of an issue and a lot of the lectures were genuinely interesting. There is a wide range in how good the lecturers are from week to week, but some were great.",0.9885,"I was overall disappointed with this course. Grading was very uneven between TFs. No paper rubrics, very vague assignment guidelines, and no prior practice exams were given.

Some so–called ""landmarks"" are very obscure, and some were never even built (!). Some lecturers were very bad and boring (a few were also outstanding). Most people never bothered showing up to lecture. The readings were entirely unnecessary.",-0.9288,This class is a gem from the standpoint that it has little work week–to–week but that doesn't mean it is easy to succeed.

This was the best class I've taken at Harvard –– there's no other class like it. Every week or two you have a project, where you gradually build your technical skills and experiment with different materials and fabrication techniques; each project iterates off the former one. This is an extremely time–intensive class: I probably spent 10–15 hours/week working on a project, but for the final around 30–40 hours. No one slept before the final project was due lol. That being said,  I spent this much time in the class because I loved it, and this class really is what you make of it. Because the class is super small, you get to know the other students really well and get a lot of time with the instructor and TA's. Everyone in the GSD is also so genuinely nice and will gladly help you when you have no idea what you're doing because you're an undergrad. Most of this class is spent on building models and is very hands–on, but you also get lots of experience in Rhino and Illustrator. The class is very abstract though, and doesn't really get to building anything in the ""real world"" until the final project, and even then the project was still slightly abstract. However, the abstract models are still very structured and not just doing whatever you want, which I liked. I was not an architecture major before this class, but now I'm seriously considering going to architecture grad school because I loved it so much.

Because my remarks elsewhere in this evaluation comprise what I would tell future students about the class, I am providing sections of those responses below, as my response to this question: This course has too many strengths to enumerate all of them.  Professor Reich has done an excellent job in structuring the course in terms of the broad division between the lecture and discussion formats.  Professor Reich's enthusiasm for the material was infectious, and at the same time. Professor Reich was also a very clear lecturer, explained ideas as well, and also made clear early on that the course would be technically challenging (more on this later). Professor Reich also took great care to acknowledge and discuss the fraught ethical and political landscapes into which ancient DNA studies are injected. In addition to these, Professor Reich was very responsive to student communications throughout the semester. He was very receptive to student questions in class. Importantly, he introduced students to the difficult and often tortuous landscape of science research and the enormous amount of effort that underpins the movement of research from an initial idea to a published result. Professor Reich will help students learn not only about ancient DNA but also about how science is done.  The class covered diverse temporal and geographic scales, and did an excellent job of demonstrating the role of genes in understanding ""deep"" history and how genetics can contribute to problems of social science (i.e., this is not only a genetics class but both a genetics class and a history class, capturing the core themes and goals of HEB).  The opportunity to work with ancient DNA datasets under the mentorship of highly skilled and committed mentors is extremely valuable and will ensure that students leave the course with a strong appreciation of the rigors and wonders of the role of human genes in elucidating the human story.",0.9916,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

I think that Hum 10 is a really interesting class in general, and the vision for Hum 10 that is projected during info sessions and in group chats is certainly appealing; after all, a yearlong transformative experience through great texts seems to be the quintessential Harvard course, and the hype that is built up around it (not to mention the prestige it holds) makes it seem like a great and distinguished privilege to take the course.The course itself is not bad by any means, but I think that it is slightly different than the experience that I had originally expected. The work it takes to keep up with the breakneck pace at which you are expected to read books is not inherently a good reason to dislike the course; after all, there are giant warnings throughout the application process and in the general culture/buzz surrounding Hum 10 that it is ""a book a week"" and ""only for humanities kids who would like to marry a book one day."" But, the pace at which the course runs through texts can make the texts (and conversations about them) far less meaningful. I often found myself reading these great texts with the express goal of finishing them before lecture, even though I had looked forward to reading many of them for a long time; in the end, I feel like I never got to really enjoy or savor what makes these texts so great: their cultural background, their language, their stories, their influence. A better and richer understanding of the texts felt restricted by time, and I often found myself wishing that we had another week to discuss them, which sounds cheesy and corny and cringy but is ultimately true. All that being said, Hum 10 does expose you to a ginormous selection of texts, and for someone who came into Hum 10 without reading most of the texts on the syllabus, I do appreciate being familiar with these texts that are referenced so often.Seminar can be a little hit or miss I think. I liked my seminar both semesters, and the people in them are some of my close friends on campus, but I also think that Hum 10 is a class that encourages speaking in seminar for the sake of speaking and that punishes just listening to the insights that others have on texts. There's a broader problem, I feel, with the participation grade that is worth 25% of your grade each semester: we are never told our participation grade and are only given a vague overview of what goes into it (""eh it's like if you participate in seminar and writing lab and turn your stuff in on time and attend lecture""), which leads a lot of people to perhaps over–participate? I think that I sometimes found myself making a comment in seminar not because I was really dying to make the point but because I didn't want to say nothing for the entire seminar, and I was slightly concerned that someone would make the point before me.Writing lab does not teach you writing. I think this is one of the reasons that I still feel a little iffy about my decision to take Hum 10 over Expos 20; I am far from being a good writer, and I've heard that Expos (at least certain sections) are really good at teaching you how to write. I can say confidently that Hum 10 did not really teach me how to write, and I'm not sure if my writing has improved much over the course of this year. Maybe that's just me though. On a related note, essay grading can feel a little arbitrary; I'll say that I never received a grade that was wildly out of my expectation, but there was always a 3 grade range in which I had no idea where I would land. Feedback can also feel a little arbitrary and detached from the grade you receive. I'm also not sure if writing labs are standardized, but there definitely are some concerns with some writing labs having a TON of really great writers and the effect that might have on the grades you receive. This is complete hearsay though.The finals are brutal, mentally. They are eight hour finals during which you write two 1000–word essays, each of which must discuss two texts from the semester.

I think that Hum 10 is a really interesting class in general, and the vision for Hum 10 that is projected during info sessions and in group chats is certainly appealing; after all, a yearlong transformative experience through great texts seems to be the quintessential Harvard course, and the hype that is built up around it (not to mention the prestige it holds) makes it seem like a great and distinguished privilege to take the course.The course itself is not bad by any means, but I think that it is slightly different than the experience that I had originally expected. The work it takes to keep up with the breakneck pace at which you are expected to read books is not inherently a good reason to dislike the course; after all, there are giant warnings throughout the application process and in the general culture/buzz surrounding Hum 10 that it is ""a book a week"" and ""only for humanities kids who would like to marry a book one day."" But, the pace at which the course runs through texts can make the texts (and conversations about them) far less meaningful. I often found myself reading these great texts with the express goal of finishing them before lecture, even though I had looked forward to reading many of them for a long time; in the end, I feel like I never got to really enjoy or savor what makes these texts so great: their cultural background, their language, their stories, their influence. A better and richer understanding of the texts felt restricted by time, and I often found myself wishing that we had another week to discuss them, which sounds cheesy and corny and cringy but is ultimately true. All that being said, Hum 10 does expose you to a ginormous selection of texts, and for someone who came into Hum 10 without reading most of the texts on the syllabus, I do appreciate being familiar with these texts that are referenced so often.Seminar can be a little hit or miss I think. I liked my seminar both semesters, and the people in them are some of my close friends on campus, but I also think that Hum 10 is a class that encourages speaking in seminar for the sake of speaking and that punishes just listening to the insights that others have on texts. There's a broader problem, I feel, with the participation grade that is worth 25% of your grade each semester: we are never told our participation grade and are only given a vague overview of what goes into it (""eh it's like if you participate in seminar and writing lab and turn your stuff in on time and attend lecture""), which leads a lot of people to perhaps over–participate? I think that I sometimes found myself making a comment in seminar not because I was really dying to make the point but because I didn't want to say nothing for the entire seminar, and I was slightly concerned that someone would make the point before me.Writing lab does not teach you writing. I think this is one of the reasons that I still feel a little iffy about my decision to take Hum 10 over Expos 20; I am far from being a good writer, and I've heard that Expos (at least certain sections) are really good at teaching you how to write. I can say confidently that Hum 10 did not really teach me how to write, and I'm not sure if my writing has improved much over the course of this year. Maybe that's just me though. On a related note, essay grading can feel a little arbitrary; I'll say that I never received a grade that was wildly out of my expectation, but there was always a 3 grade range in which I had no idea where I would land. Feedback can also feel a little arbitrary and detached from the grade you receive. I'm also not sure if writing labs are standardized, but there definitely are some concerns with some writing labs having a TON of really great writers and the effect that might have on the grades you receive. This is complete hearsay though.The finals are brutal, mentally. They are eight hour finals during which you write two 1000–word essays, each of which must discuss two texts from the semester. We don't get written feedback on them, and, like above, the grading can feel a little arbitrary.I think this is my second–to–last but main substantive paragraph. The people (yes, cheesy) are honestly what makes me feel better about taking Hum 10. As someone who is not likely to take many humanities classes in the future, I'm really, really glad that I had the opportunity to meet all of the incredible people in Hum 10: professors are all incredible people and academics, TFs are wonderful and smart and insightful, and the students are super helpful and genuine and sweet. If you do take this class, don't be the person who doesn't talk to other people; suffer in company and talk to your fellow Hum 10ers. Truly some of the smartest and most genuine and deepest people I've had the privilege of meeting.If you're still deciding whether or not to take Hum 10, ask yourself why you want to take it, try reading one of the texts in a week, and think about whether you really have the time to devote to Hum 10. From personal experience and from comments I've heard, do not take the course a) if you don't feel super confident already in your writing ability, b) if you don't think you'll have the time/stamina to read a book a week earnestly, or c) if you are only/mostly taking the course for the prestige. Also consider whether a) you have read a lot in the past and b) your experience before college has prepared you to talk with lots of kids who went to prep schools (something I genuinely wish someone had talked to me about).

I think that Hum 10 is a really interesting class in general, and the vision for Hum 10 that is projected during info sessions and in group chats is certainly appealing; after all, a yearlong transformative experience through great texts seems to be the quintessential Harvard course, and the hype that is built up around it (not to mention the prestige it holds) makes it seem like a great and distinguished privilege to take the course.The course itself is not bad by any means, but I think that it is slightly different than the experience that I had originally expected. The work it takes to keep up with the breakneck pace at which you are expected to read books is not inherently a good reason to dislike the course; after all, there are giant warnings throughout the application process and in the general culture/buzz surrounding Hum 10 that it is ""a book a week"" and ""only for humanities kids who would like to marry a book one day."" But, the pace at which the course runs through texts can make the texts (and conversations about them) far less meaningful. I often found myself reading these great texts with the express goal of finishing them before lecture, even though I had looked forward to reading many of them for a long time; in the end, I feel like I never got to really enjoy or savor what makes these texts so great: their cultural background, their language, their stories, their influence. A better and richer understanding of the texts felt restricted by time, and I often found myself wishing that we had another week to discuss them, which sounds cheesy and corny and cringy but is ultimately true. All that being said, Hum 10 does expose you to a ginormous selection of texts, and for someone who came into Hum 10 without reading most of the texts on the syllabus, I do appreciate being familiar with these texts that are referenced so often.Seminar can be a little hit or miss I think. I liked my seminar both semesters, and the people in them are some of my close friends on campus, but I also think that Hum 10 is a class that encourages speaking in seminar for the sake of speaking and that punishes just listening to the insights that others have on texts. There's a broader problem, I feel, with the participation grade that is worth 25% of your grade each semester: we are never told our participation grade and are only given a vague overview of what goes into it (""eh it's like if you participate in seminar and writing lab and turn your stuff in on time and attend lecture""), which leads a lot of people to perhaps over–participate? I think that I sometimes found myself making a comment in seminar not because I was really dying to make the point but because I didn't want to say nothing for the entire seminar, and I was slightly concerned that someone would make the point before me.Writing lab does not teach you writing. I think this is one of the reasons that I still feel a little iffy about my decision to take Hum 10 over Expos 20; I am far from being a good writer, and I've heard that Expos (at least certain sections) are really good at teaching you how to write. I can say confidently that Hum 10 did not really teach me how to write, and I'm not sure if my writing has improved much over the course of this year. Maybe that's just me though. On a related note, essay grading can feel a little arbitrary; I'll say that I never received a grade that was wildly out of my expectation, but there was always a 3 grade range in which I had no idea where I would land. Feedback can also feel a little arbitrary and detached from the grade you receive. I'm also not sure if writing labs are standardized, but there definitely are some concerns with some writing labs having a TON of really great writers and the effect that might have on the grades you receive. This is complete hearsay though.The finals are brutal, mentally. They are eight hour finals during which you write two 1000–word essays, each of which must discuss two texts from the semester. We don't get written feedback on them, and, like above, the grading can feel a little arbitrary.I think this is my second–to–last but main substantive paragraph. The people (yes, cheesy) are honestly what makes me feel better about taking Hum 10. As someone who is not likely to take many humanities classes in the future, I'm really, really glad that I had the opportunity to meet all of the incredible people in Hum 10: professors are all incredible people and academics, TFs are wonderful and smart and insightful, and the students are super helpful and genuine and sweet. If you do take this class, don't be the person who doesn't talk to other people; suffer in company and talk to your fellow Hum 10ers. Truly some of the smartest and most genuine and deepest people I've had the privilege of meeting.If you're still deciding whether or not to take Hum 10, ask yourself why you want to take it, try reading one of the texts in a week, and think about whether you really have the time to devote to Hum 10. From personal experience and from comments I've heard, do not take the course a) if you don't feel super confident already in your writing ability, b) if you don't think you'll have the time/stamina to read a book a week earnestly, or c) if you are only/mostly taking the course for the prestige. Also consider whether a) you have read a lot in the past and b) your experience before college has prepared you to talk with lots of kids who went to prep schools (something I genuinely wish someone had talked to me about). Talk to lots (lots!) of people who have taken the course because almost everyone I know has a slightly different take. Best of luck if you do take the course. <3",0.9994,"Hum10 teaches you so much more than the basics of the humanities.

The lectures are very good, and he answers all questions during the lectures.

Also, this class was a 9AM three times a week (with no recordings), so just make sure you're prepared for this. The community is really great, and many students in this class actually did not come from a high school math background but were more so interested in fields that require knowledge of real analysis. Because of this, a collaborative environment was fostered. I think it's really important to find people to pset with, if not the most important. Definitely definitely attend Wes's office hours. He is an amazing professor but also such a kind person, and it's very nice to get to know him! He can also clarify gaps in your knowledge about lecture material. For psets, I think it's more helpful to go to the CAs office hours since you can collaborate with students, but Wes gives great intuition behind how to solve the problems. This class is extremely rewarding, in my opinion, if you put in the time. Because the psets are not graded harshly, it felt that a lot of my energy was spent truly learning the material instead of perfecting pset solutions like in some other classes.

First of all, Prof. Auroux is wonderful. He's incredibly accessible and cares about making sure people are doing well. He is going to be in France next year, but I'm sure whoever is teaching 55 in 2022–2023 will be great! The material is really beautiful (although you can certainly have more of a taste for certain things than others), and it feels ever–so–slightly more chill than 55A.The material is honestly quite interesting. Topology – and especially algebraic topology – is a fundamental discipline to basically anything, and Auroux's presentation of complex analysis is very good for getting you to appreciate just how beautiful of a subject it is. Full disclosure, I am not the biggest analysis fan – I liked alg top far more – and I didn't have any experience with real analysis. Yet, often during the two weeks we talked about real analysis, there was a general sentiment of ""yeah this is all stuff we should know."" The point being: this class is technically an introduction to all these fields, but unless you're ready and willing to make it the center of your spring semester, it won't be a very comfortable introduction.The psets were also generally fun. There were some questions that definitely should have been marked as challenge problems that were simply not, but beyond that they were good. Do start psets early, or at least look at them early – it takes time for things to sit and be mulled over in your head! The exams can be a big source of stress, but I think they were generally easier than in 55A – analysis at this level is often ""done on autopilot,"" in that there's only so many tricks you can try before something ends up working. Overall, try to stay on top of the material – it is much harder than you expect to catch up if you fall behind, speaking from experience.On the other hand, the class environment in 55B is... less than stellar. Your best hope is to find a good group of people to pset with that aren't magnets for drama, but in my case, there was so much drama going on that I didn't go to lecture for a very long time. 55 attracts a very specific kind of person – generally, people who enjoy suffering, or enjoy watching other suffer around them, and people who, as mathematicians, haven't quite mellowed out from the cutthroat, competitive, and prestige–centric attitude that high school math things breed. If I could have taken the class entirely remotely, I probably would have.So, should you take 55B? First, I don't think 55A is a strict prerequisite, but definitely a soft one – the familiarity with group theory is essential for alg top. And as my experience goes, I think there's basically no barrier to entry, save for how much time you're ready to put into it. If you want math to be the center of your spring semester, then go for it. If not, then take 25B or 22B, or whatever is best for you (you'll quickly realize that if prestige is what you're shooting for, your mental and physical wellbeing are high costs to pay for it). In any case, good luck with your decision and whatever you choose to do!",0.999,"Auroux's version of this course is significantly harder than his version of 55a. Work through MIT OCW 18.02 (multivar, the number might be wrong) through winter break or at some point before taking this course because while this course has no ""formal prerequisites"" multivar is essentially a must.

This class is accessible to a fairly wide range of math backgrounds, has a good balance of definitions and interesting results (i.e. not too many of the former and plenty of the latter), and the problem solving on the PSets and exams is mostly satisfying. I'll now get into more detail about what I felt were this class' pros and cons.Pros:– Lectures. Dr. Balibanu does an amazing job explaining difficult concepts so that everyone can understand them. Coming from a limited math background (only previous math courses were 21a/b, with some proof–writing experience), I was somewhat apprehensive about my level of preparation for the class. The most out of place I ever felt was occasionally when she would ask, ""who here has at least heard of concept X,"" to which most of the class excluding me raised their hands. However, she would go on to then clearly explain the concept and how it related to the material at hand. Despite my minimal prior math experience, I found the lectures very clear and easy to follow. This was especially evident when trying to self–teach myself the concepts from textbooks –– the lectures were significantly easier to learn from.– Course content. Obviously this is very subjective, but complex analysis lies at the intersection of many areas of math wherein many interesting results are fairly easily accessible, without needing to get bogged down in too many definitions. The class is at face value an extension of multivariable calculus to the complex numbers, and it provides very nice ways to think about otherwise difficult problems such as the fundamental theorem of algebra, certain real–valued integrals and infinite sums, and the Riemann zeta function. It is clear that the concepts of complex analysis are very useful for future areas in math, but even if you're not planning on continuing to study math, they are also pretty fun to learn/think about in and of themselves.– Course staff. As previously mentioned, Dr. Balibanu is a great lecturer. She is also generally very accessible in office hours and in Slack, and the TFs are similarly helpful, especially in the resources and review sessions they have before tests.– Grading. The grading for this course is half PSets and half exams. The PSets can be tricky and occasionally take a while, but office hours are great in helping to get through them, and they are graded leniently. The exams are very fair –– the problems are often easier versions of those from the PSets, and lots of points are given just for remembering definitions (btw –– when studying, make sure to know all the results, especially those with names).Cons:– Course materials. Outside of lecture, the only real supplementary course resource is the textbook which, as I previously mentioned, can be difficult to learn from. This is fine if you go to all the lectures and take good notes, but there are no lecture notes/recordings to help catch you up to speed if you don't (though this was Dr. Balibanu's first iteration of the course, so maybe this will change).– Feedback. The only feedback given is the PSet and exam grades. The exams were graded pretty quickly, which was appreciated. However, the PSets often took many weeks to be returned, which especially mattered given that there were (generally) no PSet solutions available other than by going to TFs during office hours and asking for explanations.– Computational homework problems. The PSets were a mix of conceptual and computational problems. While the conceptual problems were generally good concept review, the computational problems sometimes became tedious and felt like busywork.",0.9969,"This class is fairly difficult and Ana does not offer practice exams or answers to pset problems, so it is hard to study for exams.",-0.7063,,0.0,113608,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Mathematics,Mathematics,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Complex Analysis

He supplements the lectures with great lecture notes, which come in handy when reviewing for the final. They're very clear, and much less dense than Marcus (the textbook).

However, this Math 129 was badly structured and that prevented the course from being enjoyable at all. First, we were assigned weekly reading from Marcus' ""Number Fields"" textbook. I don't have anything against reading some pages every week, but the fact that lectures covered the same material as the readings did (sometimes slightly less, professor Mazur often skipped details, focused on irrelevant concepts, or just presented too slowly) made going to lecture basically useless. It also didn't help that Marcus was an EXTREMELY BORING read. I believe that the course could have been structured in a way that avoided the reading assignments and instead present in class only the key results without going into all of the boring details. Second, homework was badly designed: everybody complained about the length of it and I found many exercises to be there just for the sake of maintaining the assignments at a certain length. On the bright side, the presentation part of the course was not bad: I learned some very interesting applications of algebraic number theory while doing research for my presentation. Overall, I would recommend the course for its material, but I would avoid taking it with professor Mazur, unless he changes the course structure.

Prof. Hopkins is an incredible lecturer, and I highly recommend going to the lectures (no matter who teaches it next semester). Even though is is really busy (being the head of the math dept.), he makes time for his 231 students and his office hours are very fun! Also, Sanath Devalapurkar, our CA, is great; he's super helpful, accessible, and does a good job complementing Prof. Hopkins' perspectives.The material in this class is very beautiful... if abstract homotopy theory is your thing. I'd recommend having a working knowledge of category theory (i.e. going through Riehl's Category Theory in Context ch. 1–4 would be slightly overkill, but the definitions in those chapters shouldn't be unfamiliar), and a good familiarity with the computations of (co)homology.  The material definitely starts off deceptively slow, but by the time we got to spectral sequences, things were moving at a good pace. Just be prepared to be doing algebra and not geometry – that's what Paul Seidel's 18.906 is for (so I've heard). There are tons of typos in the lecture notes/psets, but as a class, we put the lecture notes on overleaf, so we would all go through and correct things – some students even added substantial exposition of things they found confusing or interesting, which was super helpful! The psets are really interesting though, and aren't a lot of work – I wouldn't get started the day they're due, because it can take some time to think about, but they're not bad at all.Overall, this class has a lot of community, very cool material, and teaches you some useful life skills (like how to use the Serre spectral sequence and the basics of ∞–categories, which are objectively useful life skills in math).

While the course syllabus said to no prior experience with coding ML is necessary (and we were told “we will teach you all the ML you need” in the very first lecture), the two short tutorials we had on ML in which we very loosely went over already written code was not helpful at all in grasping the skills that we would inevitably need for the projects. The first two assignments had less to do with ML and more to do with debugging long and unintelligible code. The project topics were already set and limited, but for some reason we were not allowed to work in groups (which to me feels very counter to the collaborative nature of true research), so we ended up in this weird situation where many people would be working on effectively the same project, but independently, which made the project feel more like a problem set rather than original research. However, unlike an actual problem set, the prompt and the requirements were much more up in the air and little help was provided. The feedback we received for proposals/midterm reports was minimal and in all honesty not that helpful. A lot of the times our slack messages would remain unanswered, and the ony TF of the class only had OH one hour per week (for a class with 75+ people!) so you couldn’t really get to speak with him for more than 5 minutes, and the OHs on the last two weeks before the project deadline (which is probably the time period during which we needed the most help!) were canceled. I know from discussions from my classmates that for both them and me, often times working on the project became borderline depressing since we had no idea what to do, which resources to use, and where to even start. Overall, I really enjoyed the topics covered by the lectures and also the readings I did for the project, but I really felt discouraged while working on it and didn’t really learn much due to the lack of resources and guidance. This course has great potential (the setup of it is really perfect for a computational neuro course), but it needs a serious reorganization if students are going to get anything out of it. More OH (and maybe more TFs?), allowing group work, and actual help on coding in ML rather than a pair of tutorials that are undeniably impossible to understand w/o prior ML knowledge would be a good start.",0.9538,Take this class if you are self–motivated to learn.

Anatomy consists of Dr. Milberg giving slideshow presentations on various structures/functions of the brain, sometimes using a human brain or a model. It can be easy to get a bit lost in this part of the course, so don't be afraid to ask questions. You'll also learn the most if you buy the workbook he recommends and actually use it. The anatomy section is tested with a relatively easy midterm. The second segment is group presentations on famous cases of abnormal cognition — think Phineas Gage, HM, ect. — that build on some anatomy knowledge but are generally interesting to work on & listen to. The take–home final was based on these cases. Our seminar was also offered an opportunity during reading period to do one last ""cutting"" of the brain to access some of the structures we weren't able to physically see earlier in the class. Overall, I'd highly recommend the course — it's a 'gem' in it's low required workload (again, you get the most if you do work outside of class that's not required) BUT it is also extremely interesting. Dr. Milberg is a gem of an instructor. He is incredibly knowledgable, friendly, accessible, and has a lot of interesting personal stories about cases he's seen throughout his career. This is a low–stakes way to learn brain anatomy (which is surprisingly lacking in the College's neuroscience department) because the workload is very low and Milberg is very willing to entertain questions. Even if anatomy is not the most interesting subject for you (as it wasn't for me), examining a real human brain is a unique opportunity that is hard to come by.

This is simply fact. You will find a great community of students and really welcoming teaching faculty who will assist you in every way they can. Some people might describe this class as scarring yourself with knowledge such that you build scar tissue to protect you from the trauma of future classes at Harvard and beyond, but it is important to remember that this metaphorical scar is composed of learning the most wide array of topics possible for an introductory course and that in and of itself is valuable.  It can help narrow down what you are interested in studying or fill in the gaps of a subject you may have felt initially weak in.  Another benefit is that the speed of learning and organization of this class will likely prepare you for rigorous courses that have plentiful resources and study aids down the line since LS50 is much more amorphous in the material it covers. Regardless, you will have to be dedicated to the pursuit of learning and thinking like a researcher over worrying over the granularity of your grades. If you focus on the minutiae of points, this is not the class for you and you will likely feel that the outcome of this class is not worth the work entailed. The perception of difficulty and  challenge within this course is only natural and there are many points throughout the course where no student has a detailed background in what is being taught, creating a more even playing field. Personally, the second semester has been exponentially easier than the first in terms of psets and exams although it's not a complete pushover.  Given that LS50 restricts 5 out of the 8 courses you take within your freshman year, I believe the second semester's lowered difficulty will allow you to take on an additional 1 or even 2 courses. With all that said, this class is definitely not for everyone. If you are not interested in exploring the integration of mathematical and physics based components into biology or chemistry, immediately walk away and run in the other direction. Ls1B and LS1A are much better fits for people interested in pure bio and chem. If you are somewhere wavering in between and wondering why this inclusion of math in biology is important or even remotely interesting, it allows you to dive deep into the mechanics of cells and life that are often taken for granted in typical life science courses and presents a useful paradigm for research questions and modeling of biological systems. Personally, I entered this course much more interested in medicine than research but in exiting, I have grown to appreciate research more in tandem with medicine. Deciding to take this course is a pretty huge decision and one that should not be left up to your ego. It's important to level your expectations by consulting with a previous student or some members of the teaching faculty but even in cases where expectations were not necessarily aligned with the reality of the course, there is a general consensus of feeling extremely rewarded by all this class has to offer.",0.9966,,0.0,,0.0,159707,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Molecular & Cellular Biology,Life Sciences,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Integrated Science

Expectations for lab reports and independent studies were extremely unclear and they took an insane amount of time with no guidance from the course staff. They gave us no information on how to prepare samples or take the images and we guessed based on online guides incorrectly and had to spend many hours doing it again. You probably will learn very little as most of the lectures are just on actin and very boring. Also, there is nothing to check if you recall them at all. The lectures are unrelated to the lab work and the quizzes can be Googled. Overall, super disorganized and irritating, but still relatively easy.",-0.9745,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

The teaching staff adjusted the course such that there were no exams and only problem sets, which was truly wonderful for someone who chose to take the class as an elective for purely intellectual enjoyment. I do not have much of a biology background, but the staff and my peers in the course were very helpful/always willing to explain certain concepts.  The problem sets were also rewarding in the sense that they required us to carry out our own research/analysis but always with the support of the teaching staff.

You seriously don’t need any background. MUSIC 2 is remarkable in that it takes people who don’t know how to read music and turns them into arrangers.As an instrumentalist, I found the beginning of the course to be quite slow, as it teaches students to read music. But I got a TON out of learning about harmony. Also, the homework is generally pleasant to do (though tedious on occasion) and very rarely feels like busy work.The projects are GREAT. They tie all of the material together so nicely and are a challenge in the best way possible. Such a joy to do and something I genuinely learned from. I loved all the creative liberty we got as well.The problems on the final were difficult but very interesting. Section was super dry, but lectures were great. Dr. Jakubowski taught us a lot of theory and exposed us to lots of great, new music. And he always made sure to tie in concepts we were learning with real–world examples (i.e., songs). He not only showed us a new lens with which to look at the world, but looked through it right in front of us.Would recommend for musicians and non–musicians alike.",0.9971,Don't fall behind on the workbook assignments.

If you are, this class will teach you A LOT in a very short amount of time. You see the connections between many different genres of music; it is definitely not just classical. That being said, it can be tedious and boring at times, but that is how music theory is. If you just like listening to music and even playing a little of it sometimes, that might not be enough. You will be learning all of the fundamentals. They are fascinating, but they also require memorizing and practicing things which can get quite annoying after a while. The professor is great, the TFs are very helpful, and the projects fun. Does not require a lot of time. Probably no more than 2 hours per week to complete the simple, repetitive workbook exercises.

Seriously, genuinely, you can take this class without having ever held a baton before, so long as you are willing to put time and effort into learning the basic beat patterns and such. Do not be intimidated by a lack of experience!What you will need is a very strong background in classical music, in whichever instrument you play or in opera. I think this class probably had the highest concentration of Harvard/NEC or Harvard/Berklee people out of any class at Harvard... and you will be expected to play the repertoire when you are not conducting (for pianists, this means the piano reduction). You will likely be stressed a LOT for this class. On average, we were assigned one symphony a week + 2/3 arias, and the expectation was we should know the piece well. Fed will call you out for faking it/not preparing enough before a class! I really wish I took this class with more time in my schedule to prepare each week; I tried to compensate for my dearth of score study time with listening to the rep as much as possible, but it definitely showed.With all this said, I don't regret taking this at all. Maybe some of it is the masochistic classical musician energy, but for all its intensity and stress, I feel like I came away with a lot of knowledge on how to get better in the future (though I am unsure of how much I have actually improved in one semester). I would suggest, if you are on the fence about it, to try taking this as a 5th class, and stay or drop in the first 5 weeks after you have a better sense of what its like. In fact, I really, really strongly suggest this instead of going in based on expectations of previous years, as the class changed quite a lot to accommodate this year's group and I'm sure will do so again, and also because there are a number of factors people of different backgrounds may experience differently. It really is not for everyone, but honestly if you're still considering it after reading this you're probably the type that should try it.",0.9819,,0.0,,0.0,126275,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Music,Music,,Arts and Humanities,,Lecture,Intensive Conducting

While the course syllabus said to no prior experience with coding ML is necessary (and we were told “we will teach you all the ML you need” in the very first lecture), the two short tutorials we had on ML in which we very loosely went over already written code was not helpful at all in grasping the skills that we would inevitably need for the projects. The first two assignments had less to do with ML and more to do with debugging long and unintelligible code. The project topics were already set and limited, but for some reason we were not allowed to work in groups (which to me feels very counter to the collaborative nature of true research), so we ended up in this weird situation where many people would be working on effectively the same project, but independently, which made the project feel more like a problem set rather than original research. However, unlike an actual problem set, the prompt and the requirements were much more up in the air and little help was provided. The feedback we received for proposals/midterm reports was minimal and in all honesty not that helpful. A lot of the times our slack messages would remain unanswered, and the ony TF of the class only had OH one hour per week (for a class with 75+ people!) so you couldn’t really get to speak with him for more than 5 minutes, and the OHs on the last two weeks before the project deadline (which is probably the time period during which we needed the most help!) were canceled. I know from discussions from my classmates that for both them and me, often times working on the project became borderline depressing since we had no idea what to do, which resources to use, and where to even start. Overall, I really enjoyed the topics covered by the lectures and also the readings I did for the project, but I really felt discouraged while working on it and didn’t really learn much due to the lack of resources and guidance. This course has great potential (the setup of it is really perfect for a computational neuro course), but it needs a serious reorganization if students are going to get anything out of it. More OH (and maybe more TFs?), allowing group work, and actual help on coding in ML rather than a pair of tutorials that are undeniably impossible to understand w/o prior ML knowledge would be a good start.",0.9538,Take this class if you are self–motivated to learn.

The reading selection is also great, some nice review articles that get right to the relevant points and some very interesting papers with fascinating/pretty clean experiments!

Instead, we spent multiple lectures on ocean zones and far too many lectures on the boggle activities. There were a bunch of random activities which don't contribute to learning at all.

I liked philosophy going into this course and thought that I wanted to take it because epistemology seems very relevant to the real world and it seemed important to investigate how people come to know/ justify knowledge. However, this class successfully convinced my that most parts of  philosophy are obscenely detached from reality. The course itself is probably great if you enjoy engaging with questions and theories (about whether you are not dreaming all the time/ are justified in believing that things are colors/form beliefs about sensory input etc) that are extremely technical and have absurd totally infeasible counterexamples. The professor and tf are  enthusiastic and care a lot about the subject and are also very very very smart and clearly think about these questions a lot. However, the course itself kinda just felt like pointlessly plowing through content. On paper, it's a great course, but think very carefully if you want to spend a semester thinking about the content even if you think you really like philosophy. I thought I loved philosophy and technical arguments etc going into this course as well –– I no longer feel this way.

This course was hard, definitely one of the top 3 hardest courses I've ever taken (this is coming from someone who's taken courses like CS124 and physics143a with Doyle, so use that for comparison). It is also somewhat disorganized. At first, PSETs were due on Mondays, with TF office hours and section being held on Wednesday and Friday, so basically the only time we could get help was during Friday section (by Wednesday we hadn't even learned all of the material needed for the PSET so barely anyone had actually started the PSET). Then PSETs became due on Wednesdays after some complaints, but that made it even worse because in order for OHs to be useful, you either had to start the PSET the minute it came out or use an extension. The midterm was take–home, but it was the hardest take–home midterm I've ever taken and I definitely spent 25+ hours on it. After the midterm, the material also starts becoming disorganized since you jump between random topics like implementation of quantum computers, error correction, quantum complexity, etc., which are very interesting but you go through it so fast that you end up understanding maybe 10% of it all. There was also one week when prof. Lukin said the PSET would be short and sweet––and then it turned out to be harder than all of the previous PSETs, which I had spent an average of 15 hrs/week on.So yeah I definitely got traumatized by this course. But there is glory: Lukin is a great lecturer and is lowkey very humorous and cool, plus he's very big in the field of quantum info. The final project in this course can also be pretty cool: you basically get to use Qiskit and experiment with real quantum devices from IBM, which are a refreshing break from all of the tedious math and theory on most of the PSETs. You also get mentored by grad students from Lukin's group, which was super super helpful (if you get Nishad as your mentor, he will save your life in the class). As a result, I enjoyed this final project the most out of all final projects I've done in any course. Overall, if you are considering this course, you want to make sure you have quantum background and that you remember a lot of your linear algebra. And prepare for some trauma. But otherwise, this course is very rewarding.",0.997,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

I didn't dislike 110, in fact, I really enjoyed it, but I felt like there was something missing. Stat 111 was the missing piece and made taking 110 completely worth it. This course is similarly structured super well like Stat 110, with organized lectures, tons of great sections, office hours, wonderful TFs, a GREAT textbook that's only getting better, and assignments that neither feel too tedious nor too easy. Felt like the right level of difficulty, which is definitely REALLY hard, don't get me wrong, but I think if you put the time and energy into this course you can definitely succeed. It's not a weed–out class like CS 124, nor is it an easy–ish intro class like CS 50. This class is the real deal, but it's definitely worth taking. I think statistics is perhaps the single most useful quantitative subject to learn as it applied to EVERYTHING and really changes how you think about the world, like for real. Also, I thought Neil was a great professor. Definitely a slow lecturer, but he is SO nice, super communicative, and listens to students' concerns, and adjusts the course on the fly accordingly. I wanted to drop the course after the first week because I thought it would be too hard, but was convinced to stay in it, and I'm so glad I did. First three weeks (outside of the midterm and final, which were hard but very reasonable tbh) were definitely the most difficult, but then it stays at a constant difficulty level. Second half of the course is also even more interesting than the first, so stick with it! Also, don't be scared of the R portion of the class, it's really not that bad—lowkey the R questions were the easiest and most fun, I really looked forward to them by the end.TLDR: take this course, it's sick, go to section, go to OH, read the textbook, and ball tf out.

The material is really beautiful (at times), and if you have the bandwidth for it, you should definitely consider it!I took this as a fifth class (not the biggest mistake but whatever), and didn't really go to lecture. Subha is a wonderful professor and a kind person, but most of the lectures feel like they come straight from the textbook (a notable exception being the ones on Markov Chain Monte Carlo). This isn't really the worst thing – the textbook is wonderful in my opinion – but it makes the value proposition of a 9am lecture not great. Similarly for sections. That being said, I went to CA office hours regularly (shoutout to David and Christine) and found a ton of support and camaraderie in the class.The psets are a good mix too. I personally like the probability side of the class (i.e. Poisson processes, Brownian motion, Ito calculus) far more than the computational side (Markov chains, Metropolis–Hastings, etc.), so I enjoyed the latter half of the class exponentially more than the front half. The first couple psets are quite bashy, and the fourth pset on MCMC is literally all in R (you should be ready to learn R, because you'll be using it liberally), but the rest are generally fine, and often quite elegant.Finally, the exams are hard, and they're a big chunk of your grade. If I had known how hard, I would have seriously considered not taking the class – unlike the psets, which are almost entirely textbook questions, the exams are hard because you have to apply course concepts in ways that were really never explained or described in lecture/section. If you're not used to that (for ref., lots of people in the course took stat 210 before this or are upperclassmen stats concentrators), the exams will be hard – I'm a potential math concentrator who took three other math/stat classes, and they definitely were my hardest exams. Even having them be open–book exams was not nearly as much help as you'd think. If you're down to learn the material, don't let the exams discourage you. Just be warned.",0.9937,"I liked that I learned a lot of abstract concepts for the many stochastic processes that were covered, but I didn't like how abstract it was since I felt like I would not easily be able to apply or use the things I learned. I think the professor is really nice and genuinely cares for students, but I despised the fact that this class is graded based on 75% tests (2 midterms and a final). Given that tests are a huge portion of your grade, I feel like this course did not help me improve my problem solving skills at all. I felt like the support for actually solving problems related to the processes was lacking. Lectures were nice and organized and helped me understand 'big ideas', but there was a huge jump between understanding the concepts and solving the problems on problem sets and homeworks. The problem sets are really long at the beginning of the course, and the types of problems on the homeworks and the exams are so different. I joined this class right after taking STAT110 and felt like most people in this class were very experienced in math and stats, so I felt like a lot of skills were assumed. There weren't any practice exams for the tests and I just generally felt very lost in how to do well on the exams.",-0.9451,,0.0,113721,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Statistics,Statistics,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Introduction to Stochastic Processes

If you took MIT 6.036 (which I did), this course is almost nothing like it. 195 also basically just follows the textbook. If you're really interested in theoretical ML topics but can't motivate yourself to learn it on your own, this course may be for you. But otherwise, it'll probably fall short of your expectations. Pretty much the only part of the course I found quite interesting were the no free lunch problems on the PSETs where you run simulations to basically find different scenarios in which certain ML methods outperform another and try to explain why.  Otherwise, PSETs were tedious math and not that related to stuff from lecture. Sections mainly covered topics that weren't covered in lecture, so you don't get a chance to review and thoroughly understand the topics. Lastly, the literature review component of the course does expose you to ML research, but the key word is expose––tbh I understood <5% of the different papers that everyone presented and am still not sure what types of ML research are most interesting to me or how the stuff we learned can be applied to my own ML research. Overall, not a bad course (grading is lenient if that's something that matters to you), but the material can feel pretty disorganized and disconnected.",0.9473,"This course was truly awful, one of the worst I've taken at Harvard. I enjoyed CS 181 and so I was excited to continue learning about machine learning by taking this course. I fully regret the decision to take it. Here are the reasons why:– Pragya just lectures from the textbook (Elements of Statistical Learning), but she is less clear than the textbook.  You're better off just reading the textbook on your own – The problem sets are a complete waste of time. Instead of allow us to practice using concepts or methods from the course, Pragya's problem sets basically just asked us to try to come up with pathological corner cases that contradict common sense that applies to 99.9% of real world cases. These problems appeared on every single problem set and it was such a headache to try to come up with some stupid counterexample that provided zero insight about machine learning. Then when I saw the problem solutions, there would be absolutely nothing insightful about the solution. It was just simply about whether you were clever enough to come up with some stupid pathological distribution and function that happened to break common sense. It made me so angry to have to slave away for 10 hours to try to come up with these pathological counterexamples and these problems appeared on EVERY PROBLEM SET. And these problems were instead of actually practicing the course material. It just felt like Pragya was so tickled by these mathematical curios and wanted to force every student to be tickled by the same things, when theoretical corner cases are usually NOT what people want to learn about machine learning– The two projects are also a waste of time. Every group gets assigned a theory paper and presents it. The presentations are all completely comprehensible because everyone is trying to explain an academic paper's worth of math that is too high level for the class in only 10 minutes. I learned absolutely nothing from anyone's presentation. I'm sure there are some geniuses in the class who probably did learn something, and so if you're one of those geniuses, by all means, take this class.",-0.9874,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

We also got to hear from many absolutely incredible guest speakers— Indigenous women activists, artists, thinkers; settler allies supporting essential decolonial work.  Everybody should take this class, particularly those with commitments to environmental justice, decolonization, thinking beyond white feminisms, building beyond racial/carceral capitalism/settler colonialism (which are commitments everyone should have!).",0.9843,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

This class gave me a new lens to look at the world through. In other WGS classes, I've been frustrated with the high–level theory and lack of obvious applicability, but this class mixed both! I was taking Ec10B at the same time as this class and I'm so glad I was exposed to these alternative economic ideas. We take so much for granted about the economy and the world around us, I really really liked the diverse economies approach.",0.9098,"It can be difficult to get an A on assignments, and the later half of the course is a bit of a book club since we read through the entire textbook of ""Take Back the Economy."" It was also cool to read work that J.K. Gibson–Graham wrote, but it also meant we did not learn a lot of other perspectives.",-0.0258,,0.0,,,,,,,,,
