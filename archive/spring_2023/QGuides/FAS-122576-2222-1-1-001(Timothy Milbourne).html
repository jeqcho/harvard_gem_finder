PS 3 was not as good as PS 2, but it wasn&#x27;t as painful as a required physics class could be. The lectures were pretty confusing, especially at the beginning of the semester, but section and section videos helped clear things up. The course staff also solicited feedback on how to improve things when they saw how much everyone was struggling.

First off, this class is not accessible to those who haven&#x27;t taken PS2, no matter what they tell you. I saw those who hadn&#x27;t taken PS2 struggle hard in PS3. I guess, The only exception is if you&#x27;ve had a strong background in the courses subjects (possibly if you&#x27;re fresh off AP Physics in high school). It seems to be the support for those who haven&#x27;t taken PS2 is pretty lacking. <br/><br/>Second, the teaching in this course was very, very rough and inadequate. I only got through this course because of the TFs in office hours. A big problem with the teaching is that Prof. Franklin is just operating off of a theoretical baseline knowledge of physics that is so far from the typical pre&ndash;med undergraduate&#x27;s baseline. Unfortunately, she may just be too smart to teach college students looking to get through a pre&ndash;med course. Also, it seemed like she presented her lectures without ever preparing... it was like she just showed up and read whatever note packet was put in front of her. She also seemed more interested in making off&ndash;topic comments instead of getting through the material (we were at least a full lecture behind at one point during the semester). Frankly, I wish Prof. Milbourne taught the whole time. He seems to better understand where the undergrads are coming from and how we learn best.<br/><br/>This course had around 150 students or so. Only about 30&ndash;40 went to lecture in&ndash;person. Granted, that may be because it was at 9am on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but also it was just easier to skip through and digest what information was actually necessary to take away. The lecture component was fairly unhelpful not only because of the teaching,  but also the lecture slides were very unorganized. All the equations we need to know and how they can be applied seemed to be littered through various practice problems that we usually only got 3&#x2F;5 of the way  through. This needs to be revamped. <br/><br/>The only way I got through this course was office hours with the undergrad TFs. They actually explained the material and psets way better than how it was in lecture. I am very grateful for them. The head TF Nathan also held a fantastic review sessions at the end of the course. He explained the topics in a simple, effective manner. Practicing pset and lecture problems will be your friend in this course. Practice as many different cases as you can. It will help on the exam<br/><br/>In summary, this class would not be as difficult if the lecture teaching and organization components improved. Getting an A letter grade is not impossible, but you really will have to take initiative for it. However, if something does not change, you should look to do another physics sequence</td>

Instead, this class has made me decide that I never want to take another physics class in my life.</td>

Many of the applications of the concepts that we discuss are related to biology&#x2F;medicine, which is cool. The time commitment is also solid without being too overwhelming, with fairly reasonable problem sets and lab assignments.</td>

Melissa Franklin, while an engaging character, was not an effective lecturer, and I often left the class with a lot of confusion. Section was great, especially with the online section supplemental videos. However, exams were not at all representative of the types of questions encountered on the psets and section, especially the final exam (very brutal)</td>

It was the least well&ndash;taught, least cohesive, and least organized. I had been warned by physics&#x2F;mech engineering people about the poor quality of Dr. Franklin&#x27;s lectures, to the point that they strongly recommended that I *not* take this course. I am here to report that these warnings were all completely right and I really do wish I did not have to take this course. With her lectures, you will never get all three: finish on time, finish all material, clarity&#x2F;cohesion. You will, however, always get unwelcome and unfunny jokes which detract from the focus of the lecture. It was such a relief when Tim took over lectures, though it&#x27;s such a shame he only taught at the end of the semester when everyone was jaded from Dr. Franklin and had stopped showing up to class. The course staff also relies a little too much on everyone having taken PS2, which is not the case. For example, they kind of assume that everyone knows what the group exam is and what the format is like &ndash;&ndash; this led to a lot of chaos with the first midterm, when we ran very over time and most groups had to move to a classroom to finish. Anyways, be warned that there is a good deal of self&ndash;teaching and struggling that you will have to do if you have not taken E&amp;M before and wish to do well in this course. Luckily, there is a generous amount of resources made available &ndash;&ndash; online section videos (which are REALLY well made, actually...I did most of my learning from them), module summaries, concept review sheets, one minute videos, etc. in addition to all the office hours and help rooms. These resources are helpful and I highly encourage you to take advantage of them. I will also say that you should take lab seriously because they will give you a much better understanding of lecture material. The lab TFs are the perfect combination of patient and knowledgeable. Overall, this was a letdown because I had a really good experience with PS2 in the fall and was looking forward to another great semester of physics...Still, I realize that if you have to take this class, chances are that you are premed and need to take it anyways...so buckle up and brace yourself!</td>

You may need to teach yourself some of the concepts, and the course also offers generous amounts of office hours and &quot;help room&quot; hours, which are always nice too. This semester, the course offered an &quot;online section&quot; (asynchronous) section component, which I took advantage of and enjoyed. I found that PS3&#x27;s lab component is much more enjoyable than the lab in PS2.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_aa29d418-b9cd-4ba4-904c-a44c60366600">You are going to have to learn the material mostly from section and the uploaded summaries, not from lecture. My advice is to watch lectures at 2x speed, write down any equations&#x2F;properties, go to section, and then go to the summary, rewrite a summary with everything from the. components included and then try to solve the problems. The nice thing is that they really want you to succeed and get a good grade, so if you know your basics, then the exams should be easy. However, as someone who didnt have the knowledge that I have to teach myself and then I slacked a lot and got to the final with absolutely nothing retained, I didnt do too well. So go into this class knowing that you&#x27;ll have to cover the material by yourself and set a schedule for how you&#x27;re gonna do that. One thing I will note though is that both Professor Franklin and Dr Milbourne are really really passionate about the material and want to help you learn, so go talk to them&#x2F; alternatively Nathan has been extremely helpful.</td>

If you want to actually learn physics and have time to yourself this semester, take this over ap50 which many of my friends and boyfriend opted for and are now regretful because they have barely learnt anything and are constantly working. The lectures may be a bit disorganized but they make sure through lab, section and the sets that you actually learn the material by the end of the week and all the actual examination questions they ask are super fair. Just follow your equations sheets and you&#x27;ll be solid on at least 3&#x2F;4 of them.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_aa29d418-b9cd-4ba4-904c-a44c60366600">I write this fully aware that it has almost no impact on whether or not you&#x27;ll take this class since you probably don&#x27;t want to and are just taking it as a pre&ndash;med requirement anyway. Regardless, if this class is taught by Dr. Franklin, try to avoid this class if at all possible. Here&#x27;s a couple of the aspects of the course that made it an unenjoyable experience for me.<br/><br/>&ndash; Until Tim took over, the lectures were a mess. They essentially never finished on time, meaning that much of the lecture material had to be delayed until the next class. The notes were disorganized and hard to follow, especially if you either stopped paying attention for a few minutes or were trying to review them later on. The order of the activities themselves within a lesson often didn&#x27;t make sense, seeming to jump around rather than following some sort of logical progression of building up from &quot;obvious&quot; facts to &quot;interesting&quot; results. Frankly, the most reliable aspects of these lectures were the inclusion of some off&ndash;color jokes, usually about pre&ndash;meds.<br/><br/>&ndash; Similarly, the class overall seemed quite disorganized, especially for one that has been running for so long. For most of the first part of the course, there wasn&#x27;t even a consistent file naming system. This is especially important because there&#x27;s no centralized resource for all the materials. There&#x27;s module review notes and section videos, but neither are guaranteed to cover all of the concepts that you need to know. The most comprehensive way to find all the class material is by individually going through all of the lecture notes, and even then you have to hope that you can comprehend the annotations from the notes or that you have enough time to watch the recordings.<br/><br/>These points, as well as other small things that build up like the randomly nitpicky questions they like to ask on exams that seem to test more for if you read the question twice than for actual understanding, just added up to a less than ideal time in the class. I hate to say it but frankly, I&#x27;m someone who has generally always enjoyed physics, and this class has helped me realize why so many others don&#x27;t. That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s all bad. The section TFs are helpful, the labs do a good job of reinforcing the materials without being needlessly long (and only 5 in the semester), and Tim&#x27;s teaching near the end of the semester really helped to turn things around. Unfortunately, these redeeming qualities aren&#x27;t enough to stop me from recommending against taking this class if you have the option.</td>
