CS51 is by far the most difficult class I&#x27;ve taken at this school. <br/><br/>Problems I had with this class: <br/><br/>1. Lack of structure<br/><br/>This class only has 5 lectures, and none of them were useful. Literally all they talked about was how beautiful programming is. What does that even mean? Like please I just want to pass this class. <br/>Lectures in NO WAY prepared you for assignments or exams. The only time any useful information was given was during code review (section) which is led by TFs, who are literally sophomores. Instead of lectures you would go to lab, where you would be assigned a random partner (this partner changed every week). I do not think this was conducive to learning because a lot of times your partner was just as lost as you so you’re both just sitting there and can’t figure anything out. Then you try to call over a TF and they tell you you’re doing everything wrong. And then you’re like, “How would I have known that?” Guess what. There’s no way you would have known that because the professors don’t lecture.<br/>In addition, the textbook for this class is NOT well written. The majority of the exercises provided in the textbook have no answer key, so you have no way of knowing whether you’re on the right track or not. The textbook is also so theoretical. It is very confusing and hard to read. I would say reading 10 pages of that textbook takes around an hour and a half, if you actually want to understand. <br/>Thirdly, the grading system in this class was very arbitrary. If you completed the assignment exactly how you were asked to, you would get a 90%. The only way to receive 100% was to code so well that you were on the same level as the professors. Let me ask you, how would I get to that level without ANY real lectures from said professors??<br/><br/>2. Impossible exams<br/><br/>There are two exams in this class and I failed both of them. I have never done so bad on an exam before in my life. The sad thing is, when I was taking the exams, I thought I was doing pretty good. However, the way the questions build on each other makes it very easy to get a low score if you mess up the first part of the question. Additionally, some of the exam questions were so vague that I just completely misunderstood what I was being asked to do and as a result received like 0&#x2F;12 points for that part of the test, even though I was somewhat competent. <br/>They release all previous exams to students as study material, but NONE of the previous exams have answer keys because apparently the professor and TFs used to just grade them as they went WITH NO ANSWER KEY. I’m sorry can you literally do the bare minimum and make an answer key to your own test??? Ridiculous.<br/><br/>3. No support for students<br/><br/>All office hours for this class are overly crowded. Office hours were run from saturday&ndash;wednesday, and PSETS were due on Wednesday night. I have major issues with the way CS51 office hours were set up. For starters, we all know the CS department is loaded. Why then, are there only TWO TFs are each office hour session? In LS1b, there are literally 20 TFs staffing one office hour session, and you hardly ever have to wait to ask a question. In CS51 office hours, I had my hand raised on their virtual platform for over an hour before a TF came to address my question, and by that time office hours were about to end. Please hire more TFs so office hours are not so busy. I truly felt bad for the TFs in office hours but at the same time I was so desperate for help that I had to be aggressive and literally beg them to continue answering my questions before moving onto the next person in the office hour line. When we asked course staff to add more office hours earlier in the week so we would have to rush to finish PSETs, they suggested that we simply work on it more individually. If I was capable of working on the pset individually, then yes, this would solve the problem. Unfortunately I was so lost that I actually had no idea how to begin each PSET. Like I’m not a bad student. This should not be happening.<br/><br/>One of the more useful components of this class was the Ed platform that people asked questions on. That being said, the reason it was so useful was that there were two genius students in this class that would just answer everyone else’s questions. While I do love them, that should not be their job.</td>

It feels scary to spend two or three or five times as long on psets as some other students, but I feel like with the support available in the course, like all of the office hours and being able to ask questions while working on labs during class makes it possible to do well in the course even without additional background. It can feel intimidating, but I think CS51 was one course where I felt like the effort I put in reflected pretty well how I was performing in the course, and the more you put into it, you will actually get out. I walked in being super unconfident in coding, but I feel like I actually learned so much in this course and that I actually understand a lot of the concepts that will be helpful moving forward.</td>

The course is flipped classroom, so you do reading outside of class and dedicate most class time to labs (solving problems). The concepts taught are super helpful and will make you a better programmer. However, I didn&#x27;t like the structure of the labs. When pair programming, we were often not matched in skill level which made it tough to learn. If my partner was faster than me, we tended to speed through the lab to get it done in time, and I felt that they did the majority of the critical thinking. If my partner was slower than me or if they hadn&#x27;t done the reading, I felt that it was inefficient to spend time explaining topics to them because we wouldn&#x27;t be able to reach the tougher problems at the end of the labs. Then, since lab solutions are published the next day, I felt that many students (including myself) just didn&#x27;t have the motivation &#x2F; time to finish the labs on our own, since we had psets that we would learn from.

First, you&#x27;ll get good at writing code in OCaml, but it&#x27;s such an obscure and strange programming language. Despite what instructors say, I don&#x27;t think your programming skills in OCaml just naturally transfer over to other languages. Second, the course is just so poorly designed. TFs grade code design almost arbitrarily, and whether you get a check&ndash;plus or check depends almost entirely on who&#x27;s grading your pset. I&#x27;ve heard that some TFs simply don&#x27;t give out any check&ndash;pluses at all, which is extremely unfair. The exams are very challenging and pretty much determine your grade since everything is based on your z&ndash;score, so good luck competing against the senior CS concentrators&#x2F;competitive programming kids who need to take this as a concentration requirement. I personally found the textbook to be awful and also did not like the flipped&ndash;classroom format. I&#x27;m not a CS concentrator, but this course discouraged me from taking more courses in the department. If you&#x27;re a freshman looking for a CS course to take in their second semester, I&#x27;d say you should just take CS 124 if your math background is strong enough.

You will learn a lot about functional programming in specific and good design in general, but you will work for it. The psets are difficult and take a while, so office hours and Ed are your friends. The midterms: I don’t honestly know if you can do well on them but they do curve it a lot (thankfully). The final project: really do start it early and do it at every spare moment.</td>

Some of you may be thinking about taking either CS51 or CS124, but personally, I think that taking CS51 is definitely the move because it really prepares you to not just write code, but write efficient and well&ndash;written code. As long as you have pset buddies, this class is not too bad at all. If you are like me, and prefer to actual code rather than learn theoretical concepts, you should definitely take this course over CS124.</td>

It improves your coding a lot and teaches you a lot of concepts. However, it has so many components. I had to do something related to CS51 every day of the week. If you don&#x27;t start the psets early the office hours are completely useless. There are so many readings and you are basically learning the course on your own. It is like an inverse classroom. If you are not into that, I would not recommend it.  This course would have been way more helpful if it was the only time consuming course. Around the half of the semester, I started hating it because I did not have time. The course is graded on a z score and people who have more time basically get higher. Overall, take this class if you are planning your entire semester around it.</td>

The textbook was a drudge to get through, full of &quot;interesting&quot; tidbits and the author thinking himself clever, obscuring any actual important information. The labs really depended on who you got as your partner, whether you would be sitting there in awkward silence or making awkward conversation for an hour, because you only get two days with your partner and there&#x27;s never any time to get past the awkward stage before you get a new partner. At some point the fifteen minutes the professor spends at the beginning of labs briefly reviewing the textbook and the submitted questions became the only bearable part of class. The labs and the psets themselves were alright. While the TFs and CAs were helpful and knowledgable, they were not very approachable. As a side note about something I probably should not be this annoyed about, once I was trying to get help from a CA in lab but he stopped to talk with one of the students who was his friend for ten minutes instead. The final project didn&#x27;t really feel like a final project; it didn&#x27;t feel cumulative or like something I worked up to. It was just semantics, which had been otherwise absolutely irrelevant. Take this class if you love karmic edification.</td>

They assume you know everything you need to know, which was fine with me because I knew it but if you didn&#x27;t then you&#x27;re really going to struggle. They say there&#x27;s no final but &quot;Midterm 2&quot; is just a final in disguise, and the psets vary in difficulty a lot. TFs tend to be great but it&#x27;s a mixed bag, some are very mediocre so you have to find the good ones. Overall, not the worst CS class but also not the most well run either.</td>

I&#x27;m sure other classes are harder but you will learn much more for the work you put in. It is ironic that a class titled &quot;Abstraction and Design in Computation&quot; is so poorly designed and abstract beyond relevance.</td>
