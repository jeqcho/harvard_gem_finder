The expectations slides are pretty accurate for what they may ask you.

For every exam but the final, it always felt like my major concern was always the time crunch rather than my knowledge of the material, so that was very frustrating. It felt like I needed to know exactly how to do each exam problem on the first try as there was little to no time to try to figure out mechanisms you aren&#x27;t 100% certain of or to try to fix a mistake you made earlier in the mechanism. Additionally, the medians were always intimidatingly high on the exams, so I did wish that we could have more context on how we were doing letter&ndash;grade wise rather than only seeing the exam median (even median and mean together would be helpful).<br/><br/>Section worksheets are the holy grail of this class for sure, but Prof. Balskus is a fantastic lecturer too &ndash; those combined will give you everything you need to know for the class!

You have to dedicate a lot of time to do well, but the course staff did their best to make the material digestible. It can be frustrating and intimidating, but office hours help (I definitely did not go as much as I should have though). For the pests, start early. For exams, work through the section material and review pests. It is a lot of work, but I feel like I have learned an incredible amount from this course, and can now appreciate scientific papers much more when they talk about mechanisms.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_8f65936c-a16f-4746-8ff2-149d944d9eed">This class was ridiculously hard for me. In order to pass, you need to put in the time to review lectures and create study aids to help with memorizing (or moreso *thoroughly* conceptualizing because you need more than just memorization truthfully) mechanisms and cofactors. The exams were brutal and timed for only 75 minutes which was never enough time for me to complete and earn a high score. The problem sets are basically graded for completion. Try to finesse getting a good section TF because mine was terrible and I never left section with a better understanding of lecture material. I would actually be MORE confused. Also found Tim Brunker to be useless with understanding anything in this course, just like with S17! Just devote all your time to passing the exams since they&#x27;re basically 80% of your final grade. Aim to understand the logic of certain chemical reactions and arrow&ndash;pushing mechanisms! Take notes on the annotated lecture slides (highly recommend)! Pay close attention to the pattern of how certain questions are asked and grasp it (because they like to pull tricks during the exam)! Have a good support system to do problem sets with! Take psets and practice exams seriously! Go to Friday review sessions and weekend PSL office hours! Y&#x27;all, just put in the time and effort and you can survive this class. Wishing you the best of luck :)</td>

I will say to just be prepared as many chem concentrators will excel and might leave you in the dust so try not to be defeated. This class isn&#x27;t the end&ndash;all to be&ndash;all for medical school so just stick with it. Also do every. single. practice. problem. That is really the only thing to help you succeed.</td>

That said, if you do need to take a class like this, this is a good option in that Prof. Balskus is excellent, there is a large array of resources to support you in learning the material, and the problem sets are rounded up to the nearest 25 points (so basically every pset is a 100). Be prepared to memorize amino acids, mechanisms, etc.</td>

The lecture slides are really busy and not terribly interesting, and a large portion of the lecture material itself isn&#x27;t quite relevant to what is on exams. Lab procedures are really confusing and not well&ndash;explained, hopefully they fix this for next year (first year back from covid). I think the worst part of this class was the fact that I showed up to several office hours that were a waste of my time because the instructors hosting them didn&#x27;t let me into the zoom room or they were cancelled without notice &ndash; total pain. If you want advice on how to do well, practice problems are key.</td>

It&#x27;s still a very tough course, and be prepared to sacrifice weekends (and fun) to do well. Professor Balskus is clearly competent and Tim is a good lecturer. Most of the course staff is quite nice, although as with any premed course at Harvard, there will always be some hotshot TFs who think they&#x27;re brilliant and treat you like an idiot during office hours. Material is far more interesting that CHEM 17 for someone who appreciates real&ndash;life applications, but if you liked CHEM 17, you probably won&#x27;t like CHEM 27 as much. If you hated CHEM 17, CHEM 27 is bearable, especially without the complete nonsense mechanism expectations in 17 and with tons of abbreviations.</td>

Don&#x27;t come into the class expecting it to be like 17 — or even as hard as 17. I think there&#x27;s a lot of learned helplessness in orgo, but it&#x27;s actually not that bad if you put your mind to it.</td>
