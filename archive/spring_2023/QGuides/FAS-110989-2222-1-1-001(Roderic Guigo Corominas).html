The sense of fulfillment it will bring you is exceedingly difficult to find, and taking this class is a beautiful experience. <br/><br/>I came into this class after having taken math classes earlier in college and struggling to the point where I became disenchanted with them. If you’re in these shoes as well, I beg you to take this class. You will fall back in love with math. It might even change the path you take in college. It’s changed mine.<br/><br/>I’d heard linear algebra was useful and widely applicable, but I had no idea just how much that was the case. And I can safely say that there were many moments where I sat in class and simply marveled at just how powerful the material I was learning was. <br/><br/>Is this class hard? Yes. But you will have so much support from so many exceedingly patient and helpful CAs and TFs, and you will have so many resources at your disposal. If the textbook doesn’t help you understand something, lecture will. If lecture doesn’t, the videos posted on Canvas will. If the videos don’t, the course staff will. So on and so forth. There are so many office hours as well. You’ll never need to worry about not having enough in&ndash;person office hours to attend. And come finals, you’ll have review sessions to attend. Janet (the course head) even sent out articles on how to overcome nerves around taking tests, how to answer true&ndash;false questions, etc. YOU WILL HAVE SO MANY RESOURCES AT YOUR DISPOSAL. The course staff sets students up to succeed.<br/><br/>Also, Janet basically designed a system where we could benefit from learning. For example, we got a pset drop for every three quiz sessions we attended. (By the way, at quiz sessions, students take NON&ndash;GRADED quizzes and talk through them with CAs as a full group. Very helpful!) And we were given another option re: to how to weigh the midterm grades if we filled out a survey where we assessed how we could learn the material more effectively. So you’ll be encouraged to learn and to learn to learn effectively. In fact, you’ll be rewarded for it.<br/><br/>And the problem sets set students up to learn effectively. They tie everything together so nicely and always have a clear purpose. Also, they are REALLY fun. There are even extra credit problems for those who wish to gain a deeper understanding of certain material just because.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor — whether you like math or just want to become a better student and thinker, PLEASE TAKE THIS CLASS.</td>

The class also includes ways that linear algebra is used in real life, from image compression to sound analysis to sports rankings. You likely are taking this course for a concentration requirement, so I might recommend looking at any other classes that fulfill the same requirement, but I definitely think I learned a lot from this class, and I don&#x27;t regret taking it at all.

Please take advantage of the numerous office hours that this class has to complete the Herculean task of ~36 psets, and make sure you understand the content intuitively rather than just the mechanical calculations, since exam problems often require a more conceptual understanding to figure out how to solve a problem.

You&#x27;ll have to actually manage your time to some extent. Also the TFs are very hit or miss, so if you get a bad one then you might run into issues. Overall not a bad class, well taught, but there are definitely pitfalls.</td>

There is a lot of material, so after each week, writing a few example problems will really help when preparing for exams.</td>

I went to MQC basically for every pset and it is the best way to get it done efficiently because there is always help when you get stuck. Also helpful to have a pset buddy. However, there are three psets a week which is *awful* and it does not count for very much of the grade. Exams are difficult but the practice exams are harder (lol) so if you can understand them, then you&#x27;ll be fine on the exam.</td>

This will make studying for exams much harder and you  will fall far behind since there is so much work per week.</td>

This class can definitely be a lot with three psets a week, but if you manage your time well and have a good pset group, then you shouldn&#x27;t have any issues. Also, study for tests EARLY. This class is definitely more conceptual than quantitative. If it&#x27;s not *necessary* for you to take this class, don&#x27;t take it. If it is, good luck, you got this!</td>
