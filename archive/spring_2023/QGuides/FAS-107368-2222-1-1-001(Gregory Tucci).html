This course will take you through basic chemistry concepts like entropy and acid&ndash;based reactions while also teaching you about the kWh flow of energy from the sun&#x27;s surface to the atmosphere &ndash;&ndash; all while touching on climate change.  My advice: WATCH THE LU WANG LECTURES! Professor Wang explains things incredibly and watching her review lectures really helped me prepare for each test.</td>

If you have to take this class for requirements, it really isn&#x27;t that terrible &ndash;&ndash; the psets are not hard, the grading is fair, and if you have a good TF like I did, the sections are very helpful. The teaching staff and PSLs are all very kind and knowledgeable outside of lectures, so take advantage of office hours and the breadth of resources posted on the website. Three midterms is a lot but the final is take&ndash;home and pretty easy. However, if you do not HAVE to take this class for requirements, I would avoid it. Lectures are boring and useless and the homework and labs feel like busy work.

Honestly I got a B+ and an A+ on the first two midterms and all I did to study was that I watched the review lectures, printed the review lecture handouts and did them, and did the practice exams. I never rewatched lecture. I probably missed 1&#x2F;3 of all lectures.  Last unit the content is easier but keep it up. You got this you really do, but it is so hard.

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_75968b4e-6a73-4e12-9a5c-cbba9a934444">PS11 is my least favorite course of the year. I&#x27;m saying this knowing that the course staff put a lot of effort into organizing the course and improving it over the years, and I appreciate their work. However, the biggest problem I have with PS11 is its underlying teaching philosophy, which is rigid, didactic and does not account for leaning differences. <br/><br/>I&#x27;m writing this feedback as someone who took this course because I&#x27;m genuinely interested in the topics presented. I&#x27;m not a pre&ndash;med student, but I really wanted to learn about the underlying chemistry behind climate change, energy and batteries (for a potential concentration in MechE). However, the course managed to turn the materials that I&#x27;m genuinely interested in into something I dreaded throughout this semester. <br/><br/>The reason is because of the absurd amount of requirements and rigidity of the course. Personally, I found the material quite easy. I essentially self&ndash;studied 3 weeks worth of course material in the 3 days before every exam and averaged at 97 (for the midterms). The conceptual basis of all the units is pretty intuitive to understand (as someone with an honors chem background in high school), and then the rest of the work is just plug and chug. <br/><br/>HOWEVER, this course expects you to spend essentially 3&ndash;4 hours every week just doing plug and chug. Add onto this the 2 hour lab sessions, where you essentially transfer a few liquids, write down a few numbers and just wait around. Add onto this MANDATORY lectures and sections, in which I quickly learnt it was more useful to spend my time doing other work (since I could learn the same material in 1&#x2F;10 of the time afterwards anyways).  The PSETS are long and annoying. You know that feeling when you spend 10+ hours solving a really difficult physics or CS pset and feel really accomplished afterwards? Don&#x27;t expect to feel the same way about PS11 psets. The only skill you&#x27;ll be honing is using your calculator. <br/><br/>I understand that this is a personal perspective and that there are students who might have appreciated the extra practice and explanation. However, the course should make this extra practice OPTIONAL, and not make all students sit through the grueling sections that they might not need. Personally, I also don&#x27;t learn well in large, in&ndash;person lecture halls, and it&#x27;s ridiculous of the course to presume that this is the best learning method for all students. If lecture was not mandatory, the students who genuinely benefit from this style of learning can come, and the rest can learn the materials through other methods. As long as they LEARN THE MATERIALS, which should be what matters most. <br/><br/>For the course instructors—once again, I really appreciate your work (special shout&ndash;out to Lu Wang, I essentially learnt most of the materials through the textbook + your problem solving sections, and the way. you explain things is great). The content is quite interesting, and the general progression of the course neatly links the topics together. <br/><br/>However, please seriously consider my above feedback and have more faith in students&#x27; ability to decide for themselves how they learn best. If you want students to spend a lot of hours on the course regardless, maybe consider designing more conceptually challenging problems&#x2F;bonus options, etc. for the intellectually curious rather than having a one&ndash;size&ndash;fit&ndash;all approach. <br/><br/>For students considering the course, my two cents is: <br/>&ndash; If you&#x27;re pre&ndash;med and looking for an easy grade boost (aka you have to put in hours of mind&ndash;numbing work but will probably get a good grade), sure, this is the course for you.<br/>&ndash; If you&#x27;re genuinely interested in learning the material, just get the textbook and skip this course. There are probably more useful things you can do with your time.</td>

Jim and Gregg have a great dynamic and the class is administratively organized well. Course resources and materials are extensive, which is great.

A lot of independent learning was necessary in my case. This class ends up taking much more time (even more than the 3 mandatory lectures, section, and 3 hour lab every week), since office hours become a necessary appointment in order to complete PSETs. My key to success for exams was essentially working every question given to us that Unit (PSETs, Practice Exams, Section, and Problem Solving Review) and taking notes of common concepts&#x2F;methods on the cheat sheet (which was a lifesaver since the formula sheet is not exhaustive). Just get through it. It&#x27;s not too difficult, but definitely one of the more time consuming&#x2F;stressful classes you take during the semester</td>

First of all, this class meets 5 times a week which is entirely too many. Lectures are mandatory, but perhaps the least helpful aspect of any class I have taken. Jim Anderson is apparently a renowned chemist; he should not, however, be a renowned lecturer. Disorganized and unclear, his classes somehow simultaneously assume you know nothing and are a PhD candidate in chemistry. He leaps from topic to topic either without properly explaining any concepts or by explaining the most useless information in minute detail. His style consists of namedropping Tesla a thousand times and underlining or drawing checkmarks next to random information on the prepared slides and never once does this class set out core concepts to understand, appropriately explain the relationships between anything in chemistry and physics, or ask you turn on your brain. Greg is a significant improvement, but his lectures too struggle from a lack of direction and no synthesis of material. The PSETs exist simply to occupy your time — please just find someone who is premed or chemistry and do the PSET with them so you can spend as little time on this class a possible. I never once had to think in this class, you must learn the types of questions they ask and know how to answer them and nothing else. Exams are horrendously scheduled and dull, only possible due to the presence of the cheat sheet. Labs are a good awful use of three hours of my time when I could be doing anything that remotely interests me. They tangentially relate to class material and don&#x27;t teach you anything about actual lab work all while imposing even more arbitrary deadlines and busywork to turn in. Someone please tell the natural science departments to stop requiring this class and figure something else out. The only redeeming quality of this class is that I have heard that PS1 is somehow worse.</td>

All assignments are very straightforward as in there are very few trick questions, so just try to grasp the material thoroughly. Exams are passable because they are straightforward but make sure to start studying early! Major tip: watch Lu&#x27;s problem solving reviews and review pset answers&#x2F;section handout answers&#x2F;practice exams before the exam to help with studying. I was scared of taking this course because chemistry is NOT my strong suit but it worked out in the end. Good luck :)</td>

Textbook<br/><br/>I cannot emphasize it enough: DO NOT READ THE TEXTBOOK<br/>I tried to at the beginning of the course, but it proved to be unnecessary really quick.<br/>For Jim&#x27;s lectures, only some of what he says will actually be important. Anywhere that calculus shows up can and should be disregarded. Only focus on the final equations. It is really mostly about memorizing the formulas and knowing where to apply them. For Greg&#x27;s lectures, pay attention to the practice problems. Some of them might show up psets (or at least really similar ones will).<br/>PSETs are doable. PSL office hours are the place to go. SIGN UP FOR PEER COACHING BEFORE THE FIRST EXAM. I developed a really good relationship with my Peer coach (who is also a PSL) and she has provided me support throughout the class even when I finished the peer coaching program.<br/>Start the final exam ahead of time. It is too much to try to fit into a small window of time. It is low&ndash;key more time consuming than 3 midterms, so more than 6 hours should be allotted.<br/>The 50 Questions Booklet is super useful. Start collecting the questions since the beginning of the course (that is what I did, and completing the booklet was so easy as a result). I used notability, so I just made a separate note for the questions and collected them over time, then I airdropped the file to my computer to add them to the booklet.<br/>Lectures are so useful. Some of them might be confusing or boring, but the concepts are explained in a way that will help. They are recorded, so take advantage.<br/>Section is the most useful thing ever. Go to every section, take notes, and do the practice questions you were not able to finish in section. The concepts are summarized in such a nice way that you can copy them down on your cheat sheet when it is time for an exam.<br/>Labs are cool. Some of them take forever, but many finish early. Make sure to never forget your lab glasses. Also, if your only lab experience before this was LS1a, don&#x27;t be too shocked by the abrupt change in rule enforcement and strictness in labs.<br/>You should have good analytical math solving skills, but you do not need more than algebra.</td>

Although the subject material was relatively trivial, the lectures added massive amounts of information we, as students, did not need to know. Further, Lectures were confusing to the point where many students would tune out. They had no correlation to the material on the exam and frankly were taught out of order. The last things we learned were lewis structures and periodic trends. Jim Anderson is a brilliant scientist but a teacher that does not generate enthusiasm for the subject material. I am very thankful this over&ndash;moderated, first&ndash;year weed&ndash;out class is over.</td>

Jim Anderson is a BRILLIANT MAN but cannot convey topics in a way that is understandable to most first years, especially those who have not been fortunate enough to have had a great math education. There is entirely too much focus on derivation and plugging things into equations  (many classes were merely everyone watching Jim do math for 46 minutes) instead of actually teaching the underlying concepts. This class is essentially an applied math class, most of what you consider chemistry is taught at the end. I relied heavily on the knowledge that I learned from orgo because the teaching was so bad in PS11 that I could not understand it.<br/><br/>This class is one of the biggest weed out classes on this campus and contributes to a toxic, burnout STEM culture: it is a literally a part time job and does way too much.  I am truly sorry to each and every one of you pre&ndash;meds that has to take this but YOU CAN DO IT. Survive. Get through it. Study with friends. Persevere. <br/><br/>If you want to be a doctor, literally no&ndash;one will ever ask you or care if you know the efficiency of a diesel cycle  or the kinetic energy of an ejected photon, so don&#x27;t feel bad if you don&#x27;t enjoy this class&ndash; it&#x27;s simply a hurdle you have to jump over.</td>

However, don&#x27;t be afraid to watch Youtube videos because some concepts are not taught in the most understandable way.</td>

This class takes a lot of work to do well and is extremely, extremely time&ndash;consuming. But if you put in the work it will 100% pay off, especially when it comes to the final exam.</td>

The class gives you the scientific background to understand current events (in fact, real world applications of chemistry are the focus of the course, which is what makes the materials so engaging!). The teaching staff are wonderful. I can&#x27;t rave about this course enough.</td>
