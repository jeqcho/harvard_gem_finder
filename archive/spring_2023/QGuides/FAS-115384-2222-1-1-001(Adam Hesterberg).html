I believe I was well prepared for the mathematical maturity&#x2F;proof writing skills that were expected for this course; if you are a first&ndash;year considering taking this course, I think mathematical preparation at the level of Math 22+ should suffice. However, the second half of the course heavily focuses on probability, and  I struggled understanding some concepts without having taken Stat 110 &ndash; so, although it&#x27;s not a prereq, I think taking Stat 110 will make your life easier. If you did competition math in high school, then it should also be fine. As for the CS61 recommendation, it&#x27;s not that necessary, since the class doesn&#x27;t focus too much on programming and the assignments mostly consist of writing proofs. However, for the programming assignments, it will be very useful if you know how to code in C++, so I recommend prepping a little over winter break (although it&#x27;s very similar to C, so if you&#x27;ve taken CS50 then this should be pretty quick). <br/><br/>As for the workload, I recommend this class being one of your &quot;very time consuming&quot; classes for the semester, since the problem sets are very long and requires substantial thinking. As a side note: if you&#x27;re a prospective math concentrator, I think you&#x27;ll find CS proofs to be a little hand&ndash;wavy, ex. how would you prove that a sorting algorithm is correct? The level of rigor that&#x27;s expected in a proof from a math course is not expected in this class, so make sure you don&#x27;t spend too much of your time trying to be overly technical in your proofs... I kept on doing this, and typing up my PSets took SO MUCH TIME, so feel free to be (a little) hand&ndash;wavy :)</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_745df563-c07c-4b78-bdf5-5921f392f04a">I honestly got a lot out of the course. Usually students who struggle in the course don&#x27;t have the necessary prerequisites. I highly recommend a general background in STATS&#x2F;PROBABILITY (e.g. knowledge of binomial distributions and combinatorics) as well as a strong background in DISCRETE MATH (e.g. significant practice solving problems related to graph theory, proof theory, counting, permutations, modular arithmetic, mathematical logic, etc.). I would also suggest taking CS 120 or CS 121 beforehand and being proficient in at least one programming language (ideally C++). When I enrolled in the course, I felt as though those prerequisites were assumed but not made explicit on my.harvard. The lecture notes are great, and the lectures are easy to follow. The problem sets and exams are very challenging and lengthy for everyone. Adam was probably the best part of the course. It&#x27;s clear that he genuinely cares about helping students understand the material and dedicates a ton of time to making the course a good as it can be. I am pursuing a joint concentration in math and CS and thought the course did an excellent job blending those two fields. The problems were thought&ndash;provoking and had a sort of brain&ndash;teaser feel to them. Overall, the course was difficult but worth it. <br/><br/>Also, here&#x27;s a quick heads up for those of you who are overly grade&ndash;conscious. (Grades honestly matter a lot less than you think they do, but I remember combing through Q Guide comments for insights on grade distributions freshman year. So here&#x27;s the tea.) The GRADE DISTRIBUTION in 2020 for students in the college was 21% A, 19% A&ndash;, 15% B+, 13% B, 11% B&ndash;, 8% C+, 4% C, 4% C&ndash;, and 3% D+&#x2F;D&#x2F;D&ndash;&#x2F;E. We were told that the distribution of letter grades tended to remain consistent from year to year. Adam published mean, median, and standard deviation data for all assignments and exams, so there&#x27;s some transparency in terms of what your approximate grade is at any given time. Here&#x27;s what Adam said on Ed regarding how grades are determined:<br/><br/>&quot;We calculate a percentage grade for each student as a weighted average of problem sets (30%), programming assignments (20%), midterm (15%), and final (35%). We sort by those percentage grades. Then, for each letter grade threshold (say, between B+ and B), we look through all the work done by students near that grading threshold from the previous year of CS 124 to get a sense of how well those students understood algorithms. We attempt to find a point in this year&#x27;s sorted list for which students&#x27; level of understanding seems as similar as possible, and set that point as the letter grade threshold. Then we compare those thresholds with the vague letter grade descriptions on page 31 of the Harvard student handbook to make sure they match. Finally, we look individually at people just below each grading threshold and check for substantial improvement over the course of the semester.&quot;<br/><br/>All in all, I would highly recommend the course to anyone who meets the prerequisites I mentioned earlier and is willing to dedicate a substantial amount of time to the course.</td>

I can&#x27;t stress this enough, but start the psets early and go to as many office hours as you can. Also, especially if you&#x27;re taking this class as a freshman, only take it if you know a lot of other smart freshman friends who are also taking it. It&#x27;s a collective struggle, but one of the biggest reasons I got through this class was because of the support and help from friends.</td>

However, I will give you the disclaimer that I spent over 30 hours a week for the first few weeks of the course. The expectations for problem sets were a bit unclear, and the rubrics were even less clear, so I spent a ridiculous amount of time agonizing over every little detail to try to maximize my grades. You will likely need to do the same if you want a really good grade, so either don&#x27;t do any extracurricular activities at the same time and&#x2F;or don&#x27;t take any other difficult classes. I took 3 classes this semester, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I barely had a second to spare with that schedule (also taking 109B and LING 106), and those are not particularly demanding courses. You can certainly devote a bit less time and still get a lot out of the course, but I think it is true that it is what you make of it. If you really buckle in and dedicate yourself to extracting every last morsel of knowledge from this experience, you will truly become a better thinker and a better problem solver, not just a better programmer. I am not the best student, and I certainly haven&#x27;t won any national programming competitions or anything like that. Yet, I buckled down and am on track to get a decent grade. More importantly, I feel like I truly learned, and I truly got something out of this course. You can do the same if you get past the narratives that tear this course down. Sure, there are organizational issues, and the lectures are not always perfectly consistent with the problem sets, but it is an overall great course and was definitely one of the most rewarding I&#x27;ve taken in my entire Harvard experience.</td>

I now kind of regret taking it. The concepts you learn that are useful for interviews can be learned with 3 hours of leetcoding, ther rest of it is just unnecessarily hard and not that useful. Exams are ridiculously hard, to the point that it demotivates you to study because you&#x27;re not going to be able to solve the problems anyway even after 50 hours of studying. The exams don&#x27;t test your knowledge of the material presented in class.

The material is useful, and it is a must take for those interested in CS. Mathematical maturity and some level of algorithms knowledge is helpful (and perhaps a must have) in order to succeed in this class, at least gradewise. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll still learn a lot with a lot of effort, but the group of students in this class is strong so it might be difficult to get a good grade. The class is really fast paced and covers a lot of material. We even covered a bit of MIT&#x27;s advanced algo class 6.854. Some tips I have for future students is to find a good pset group or people you can collaborate with. This is such an essential part of the learning process, and it may be extremely tough to get through this course on your own. There&#x27;s a ton of sources of material for this class (lecture videos, lecture notes, section notes, textbook, scribe notes) and you&#x27;ll eventually find a way to balance&#x2F;prioritize what you want to read. Lecture notes are not consistent with the videos, but the scribe notes are and are more digestable in my opinion. The scribe notes were added later on in the year and are very helpful. Start psets EARLY and find friends or go to office hours to collaborate. They oftentimes take much longer to write up than expected, which is a bit unfortunate and frustrating. Balance your class schedule and don&#x27;t overload–just gauge what you think is reasonable. The first week is not very representative of this class, though, the pace picks up a lot in the next few weeks so do not be fooled if you are &quot;shopping&quot; the class. Don&#x27;t take this class solely for the purpose of SWE interviewing. It&#x27;s probably not that helpful for SWE interviewing, we barely code in this class–it is more of a math class, and the material is far beyond the scope of what you need to know for interviewing. If you like math, you&#x27;ll probably enjoy this class.</td>

DO NOT TAKE CS 124 AS AN ELECTIVE OR IF YOU CAN AVOID IT. You will learn a lot and it will feel rewarding but this in no way compensates for the painful grading in the class. The TFs do not try to make students&#x27; lives easier in any way and the marking schemes are just obscene.<br/><br/>The class assignments consist of 7 problem sets and 3 programming assignments. Expect to lose 10% of the points on psets just because you &quot;were not rigorous enough&quot; which is alone extremely annoying. After the first pset, you will start including more and more detail into your explanation just to make sure you get the points you deserve but you will continue to consistently get at least 10% off on each pset, thus getting yourself into the absolute mind&ndash;numbing conundrum that this class is. The programming assignments are even worse. The coding portions are pretty cool but there is no actual final objective to the task. In the end, you have to &quot;write a report to summarize your findings.&quot; And guess what—if on that particular day, your mind&ndash;reading capabilities are off, you will lose 10% of your grade because you did not correctly guess what was on the mind of the people who wrote the marking scheme. The brutal amount of work that these assignments are feels pointless in the end—not because it was hard and you could not do it, but because it was hard, you did it, and then you lost 10% of your points because the problem statement was inexplicably vague.<br/><br/>Finally, exams. Those are really cool. If you feel like participating in the Hunger Games. Honestly, that was my favorite part of CS 124—because it was the only way in which actual understanding of the material reflected on your grade. However, be ready to be challenged. There is almost no time to complete everything, and most of the problems require some ingenuity. The median and mean for both the midterm and the final were 50%. It is a brutal class.

I can definitely understand why it is an essential component of the CS degree.  Psets often take a long time and you can spend hours thinking through problems, so I would definitely recommend going to office hours whenever you can for guidance in the right direction to try and get through things faster. I would also say that you can definitely get away with skipping lecture and attending sections instead, everything you need to know for the class will be covered in section except for the last two lectures of content (for which you can look at scribe notes or lecture notes provided by the staff), which helps balance out the time you spend on this class. The exams are as hard as people make them out to be but don’t let that scare you—the averages are often pretty low so the grades end up turning out alright. Programming assignments are generally fine except for the first one. That first progset takes many hours to just run your code, so be sure to plan accordingly for that. Finally, try to go into this class with a friend or two, or go to office hours and make some friends to have people to brainstorm pset solutions with!

This course covers 2 semesters of the equivalent MIT algorithm classes in 1 semester, so take that as you will. While Adam is based, his lectures aren&#x27;t the most helpful; go to sections. Camp out in office hours so the TFs will tell you about obscure grading criteria that isn&#x27;t evident in the pset instructions.

The exams are absurdly, obscenely difficult in such a way that they don’t allow students to demonstrate their understanding and hard work &ndash; they feel like trick questions that you either get or you don’t. I really didn’t feel like they were fair, and felt robbed of an opportunity to show what I know. There also isn’t an opportunity to do corrections on the midterm or the final. Additionally, because they’re so hard and so grades are curved, they pit students against each other and mean that how well you do is based on how much better or worse you do than your peers. This feels awful and facilitates a competitive culture. The psets frequently have tricks that you wouldn’t understand without asking the right TF (sometimes the 4th or 5th one you ask), which makes it feel like a frustrating game instead of a learning experience. The grading on the psets also isn’t so fair and often is different from how things were presented in office hours. I just can’t imagine that it had to be this hard in order for me to learn this much. If you&#x27;re taking 124, make sure you take only easy classes with it &ndash; I took it with Math 21b, which was a major mistake. Go to office hours early, start psets early, and just do your best.</td>

You may be tempted to think “oh, the Q guide is making it out to be worse than it actually is, and I’ll be able to handle it.”  Listen to the Q guide: it really is that hard.  You will be able to handle it, but you will need to prepare yourself.<br/><br/>I took this class through simultaneous enrollment, since it conflicted with another of my classes.  So, I was watching the lecture recordings, going to office hours and sections, and meeting up with people outside of class to work on psets.  You definitely can take this class through simultaneous enrollment, but make sure you find people to work with.<br/><br/>The way the class was taught this year, most of the focus was placed on algorithms.  Most (not all, but most) pset questions gave you a problem, then asked for:<br/>&ndash; An algorithm to solve it<br/>&ndash; A proof of correctness for the algorithm<br/>&ndash; The runtime of the algorithm<br/>The proofs of correctness are hard to write.  I don’t think I really fully understood what I was doing until after the midterm.  And you will write a lot of them.  I used to tell my friends that this class felt more like a math class with a programming component than a CS course.<br/><br/>There are a few programming assignments, where the focus is more on the results than your code.  I would recommend knowing C&#x2F;C++, Java, or Python.  My personal pick was C++, since it gave me the best performance (and sometimes that really, really matters).<br/><br/>Sections, while technically not mandatory, do contain material not covered in lecture.  You should attend them.  You’ll also probably want to regularly attend office hours, so make sure you know how to make the most of your time there.  The TFs are actually super nice (and wicked smart), so get to know them.<br/><br/>The tests are brutal.  The average on both the midterm and the final were roughly 50%.  Grades are curved at the end of the semester: about 20% of the class gets As and about 20% get A&ndash;‘s.  This isn’t a guarantee, this is just how they broke it down the year I took it and the previous year.<br/><br/>Honestly, I think the content of the course is really interesting, it just gets eclipsed by the amount of work you have to do for the psets.  If you plan to take this course, make sure the rest of your commitments (classes, extracurriculars, etc.) leave you enough time to deal with this class.<br/><br/>TL;DR this class really is as hard as it sounds.  If you intend to take it, brace yourself.</td>

Yes, you&#x27;ll probably spend like ~10 hours a week on psets, but they&#x27;re honestly not too bad if you stay on top of the material. The programming psets are also reasonable if you have a decent programming background; if not, start early. I think that the course content is very solid and something that every CS concentrator should know, but the class could definitely be run better. Some important content is only taught in sections, lectures are often more high&ndash;level than is required to understand the psets, and the staff does not provide many practice problems (especially compared to other theory classes I&#x27;ve taken). With all its flaws, you will take a lot out of CS 124. That being said, let me give you some tips on how to survive this class: <br/>&ndash; Start psets early.  I think the first half of the course is a bit more dense than the second. Front&ndash;load your effort accordingly. <br/>&ndash; Programming assignment is by far the hardest. 2 and 3 are much easier, so keep that in mind when you inevitably struggle on the first one. <br/>&ndash; If you took CS 120, first half is a breeze. <br/>&ndash; Don&#x27;t worry too much about exam scores. Everyone does pretty terribly<br/>&ndash; Do as many practice problems as possible. The exams in this course are not about learning content. Rather, the goal is that you should cultivate an algorithmic way of thinking. The best way to fulfill this objective is to grind out some algorithm problems.</td>

Even so, it covers some of the most important material you will learn studying CS at Harvard, and in particular is great preparation for interviews&#x2F;internships. The exams are seriously hard (getting above 50% is normally a good&ndash;great result) and the PSETs aren&#x27;t easy either. However, there are generally lots of office hours and sections, which make this course at least doable, if still not easy.</td>

Assignments and grading are often poorly defined and take an extensive period of time. You will need to already be a proficient programmer (python doesn&#x27;t cut it apparently) to be able to do well in this course. Ed discussion and OH should be attended religiously is my best advice on how to do well. You will need to teach yourself.</td>

Definitely make a good friend to partner up with for psets and the programming assignments especially. You don&#x27;t really want to do those alone. Also go to office hours!!! TFs are extremely helpful when answering questions conceptually and for the psets. Office hours is also where you can make friends while psetting and exchange ideas. <br/><br/>To prepare for your 124 experience, make sure you&#x27;re comfortable with proofs and that you don&#x27;t expect to get really high grades. Like this year the average on the tests were around 50%, and that&#x27;s ok!!! It might be the lowest grade you&#x27;ve gotten, but that&#x27;s how this class works, and everyone is struggling too!! <br/><br/>This is a great class to challenge yourself with and meet really smart people.

My entire semester revolved around this class&#x27;s pset deadlines, which was probably unhealthily warping for a single class. That being said, the material was incredibly interesting. After taking CS 124, I feel that my skills in formal and rigorous thinking have improved greatly. My appreciation for theoretical CS and algorithms has grown tremendously. And looking back on the work I did for this class, I am filled with a sense of pride. My advice for future students is: this is not a solo class — you must work together with others (and attend office hours consistently) to do well on the psets.  Proofs experience at the level of Math 22+ is pretty much required, as is comfort with probability at the level of Stat 110. This class is also largely self&ndash;studyable based off the textbook and lecture notes alone; it&#x27;s really the psets that take up so much time. But you will learn a lot from this challenge.</td>

Going into this class as a freshman having taken only CS50 and Math22A with a relatively weak math background, I found myself struggling a lot. The psets were defintely hard but totally doable if you work with other peers. Make sure you get started on PSETs as soon as you possibly can. I recommend spending30 minutes to an hour after every class, reviewing the main topics discussed &ndash; this will help you a lot with the final and midterm. <br/><br/>Going into the final and midterm, give you self atleast 2&ndash;3 weeks to prepare. I strongly believe that trying to solve 2&ndash;3 problems a day is plenty to prepare. The more problems you practice with, the better you will get. I found myself struggling on the midterm and final because I did not do enough practice and instead decided to passively rewatch lectures and review notes. This was a terrible mistake and really screwed me over on the exams. Receiving those exam grades back were really rough and really demotivated me. Be mentally prepared for that struggle. <br/><br/>Lastly, going into this course, understand that it will be a huge struggle and you get how much you put in. Go to office hours frequently and ask tons of questions.</td>
