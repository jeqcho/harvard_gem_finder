If you are a senior in your last semester, take this course. If you're a freshman in your first semester, take this course. If you're a burned out junior with no idea what to add as a fourth course, take this course.  Julia makes everyone feel like they belong in the class. Even though reading your first ethnography (you might not know what that is) might be difficult if you've never studied anthropology before, you will get the hang of it. The assigned readings are totally do–able week to week. It's not like other classes where they throw you 300 pages a week. There are a few lengthy readings, but truth be told, I got away without doing 2 of the reading assignments completely. It's obviously pretty clear when you haven't done the reading since most of the class does it, and Julia remembers every small detail from the readings. But still, the readings are actually a lot of fun and the historical relevance and analysis of the gift as a social phenomenon is just such a cool concept to study. And you're not treated like you're in high school. There are no pop quizzes like some other classes have or silly, ineffective weekly discussion posts on Canvas. This is how class usually goes if you're curious. 1.) Julia asks the class what they thought about the reading. Folks can raise their hand and answer. 2.) Someone gives their presentation on the reading. Each person has to give one presentation during the semester. Super casual. Just summarizing the reading and your analytical insights about it. 3.) We discuss that person's presentation. Usually answer some discussion questions. 4.) Julia takes it away with her analysis and leads a discussion. 4.) Class dismissed! Julia's office hours are also very easy to attend because she has them both on Zoom and in person. I probably attended once every three weeks, and they were helpful just for talking about the readings, bouncing off ideas for a paper, and even just chatting generally. I never used to go to my professors' office hours, but I took this class senior spring and decided that I wanted to change that during my last semester. It was so worth it and easy to attend office hours. Do it! If you end up taking the class, these are the readings that I thought were the most powerful: Mauss, Taussig, Bataille, Derrida, Caillois, Scheper–Hughes, Chu, Tsing, Han, Simmel. These are the readings that I thought were least important to the course theme (maybe worth sacrificing if you're short on time): Mbembe and Martinez Ruiz (I wrote a paper on this author's work but only realized afterwards how weak the author's argument is), I hope you take the class.

The teaching staff is great (both Andi and Ami care a lot and they're such kind, smart people). A big portion of the class is that you partner with an organization of your choice to work on a project that benefits a specific community (I know it sounds vague, but it's because it could truly be anything you want). I loved working with my organization and I've learned a lot about what goes into an effective partnership and what it means to be both an intellectual AND a moral advocate for the communities that I wish to stand with and serve. My definition of care has been radically changed and I will continue to bring the principles this class has taught me throughout my career. HOWEVER, with all of that said, the actual class itself wasn't necessarily my favorite: the care journals/audio explorations felt more like busywork than anything else and the discussions about the readings were not the most effective (it felt like a select few students led the conversation and a lot of the time the conversation lacked direction, there was definitely a lot of awkward silence and blank stares at each other). Also, some of the things we did during class felt pointless. Everything was definitely done with good intentions and I see the value, but personally a lot of it did not resonate with me. Would still recommend this class though, just be aware it's a decent time commitment (not the class itself, but you will be volunteering at least 3–5 hours with your organization on top of taking this class and everything else in your semester).",0.9973,,0.0,,0.0

The flipped classroom was less than ideal as so much info would be packed into the videos that a 20 minute video would take you an hour to watch and take notes and actually learn. The videos and psets were always posted late so you never got the chance to start early on them. The TFs would just not know matlab or not know an equation so there was no use of asking them about those things while they were helpful with the specific pset questions since they had the answer key. Office hours before the midterm and final were useless. Lecture was hard to sit through. It felt like Professor Howe was talking at 2x speed and just reading the slides, his voice would go in one ear and out the other. Pset gradng is extremely chill – most people get full marks. But exam grading is the WORST. No partial credit on anything. If you name something weirdly or forget to square a value after you showed that you knew it had to be squared in the formula, the whole grade is gone. It seems like if it's not an exact replica of the answer key, your whole answer is crossed off. Truly the harshest grading I experienced at harvard and i've been in much harder classes. Most weeks TFs dont show up to section, so no use going to that. There are so many equations that aren't centralized and some that you can't even find in the slides so studying and making the cheat sheet for exams is horrendous. All in all,  horrible experience, don't take this class. You could get a really bad grade even if you're used to getting As in other (harder) classes.",-0.9867,,0.0

Here are the reasons why:1) Ample study material. The course is accompanied by a very clear and well–written textbook that has been generated specifically for this course over Eli's many years of teaching APMTH 120. This is paired with a DropBox of coding examples for most of the topics you need to be able to replicate (which you should note as a useful resource for homework assignments). You will never need to scour for random resources or PDFs on the internet, as I have for so many previous classes. These materials tell you exactly what you need to know, with clear explanations or examples for each topic.2) Extremely fair quizzes and exams. You will be provided with a clear list of topics to master, as well as access to every past practice exam covering that same material. Eli doesn't believe in surprises on exams (though it would have been good to have a heads–up about the block power method this year...). The TFs are clear and responsive when you request help or need additional clarifications. If you decide to prepare in advance, you have every ability to do well.3) Highly applicable and relevant content. It was rare that we studied a topic that seemed unrelated to direct applications in data science. This is genuinely an applied class.4) Useful and achievable assignments. All the problem sets have clear instructions, as well as ample help available via office hours and Ed. They are almost perfectly tailored for the amount of time that you have available for them and will set you up well for the exams with no unnecessary head–banging.5) Great course staff and a strong support structure. The TFs under Eli are fantastic and responsive. There are a lot of windows for office hours, and they will take time out of their busy weeks to write clear responses to your stupid questions on Ed. They'll even do things like make supplementary materials or videos to explain trickier concepts. You'll never feel lost at sea.6) An awesome professor. Eli is a wonderful guy — I laughed out loud at least once per lecture — and he's the perfect person to teach this class.Don't get me wrong, the course is not necessarily *flexible* — there's a strict lateness policy, and the homework assignments come like clockwork every week, including spring break — but it's consistent, realistic, and the course staff will provide all the support in the world for you. I'm a burned out junior in AM who doesn't really feel like taking mind–numbing and/or poorly organized upper–level technical classes anymore, slogging through random proofs, learning about abstract concepts I don't care about, or spending hours debugging in whatever awful programming language my professor happens to like. Most classes I've taken at Harvard involve at least one of these attributes, typically several, but this class had none of that. It was clear, helpful, and the right degree of challenging, and I feel like the value I got out of the course scaled linearly with every hour of work I put in. I learned a lot of content in spite of myself. I'm really glad I took AM 120 and hope you take it too.",0.9958,"The lectures and homeworks are often confusing, but there are plenty of office hours. Eli is also a chill dude. Take this course because it's one of the easier options in the AM concentration, but don't expect it to be revolutionary. The concepts covered are broken down into bite–size pieces so that they're manageable for students but only provide a light intro in reality (if interested in using them in internships or jobs down the line). Overall, when considered in the context of the Applied Math concentration, this class is one to take, but it's not a great class per se.",-0.4197,,0.0

I took PS2 in the fall and really enjoyed working with the course staff, but was really concerned about my gpa while juggling a thesis. This class was a godsend. Yes, there is a lot of weekly work that you have to keep up with, but I'd take it any day over trying to study for an exam a few days before a thesis deadline (your priorities might be very different if you arent thesising). It's important to note that (in my opinion) the content doesn't prepare you as well for the mcat the way that ps2/ps3 does, but if you're already studying for the exam then you kind of already learn the specific content that you need to know (i know a few people that took the mcat before enrolling in AP50B that just taught themselves that material from practice books). So, if mcat prep is your concern, i wouldn't be too worried.I was confused about the workload for this class going into it, so I'll explain below for anyone also confused or trying to balance out an already difficult courseload.Assignments:This class is almost entirely based on effort rather than correctness (but they know if you completely BS assignments or don't put any time into them, so don't do that). If you just put in 1–3 hours for each big weekly assignment (readings/learning catalytics = 1 chapter per week and ~12 multiple choice questions, desmos tutorial = 30 shorter questions, challenge = 3 long multi–step questions), and spread it across several days, then it's super manageable and flexible to work with (cramming is also doable but just more exhausting lol). It's just like psetting but without the crying. I used to spend way too much time on assignments in the beginning of the semester, but once you get used to the flow of it and get a better feeling for student expectations, then it's much easier to work more efficiently. then, during one half of class (2x a week) you're expected to meet with your team and review your responses, discuss them with a TF, and then receive the answer key and submit corrections/a short reflection for each tutorial and challenge. If you're efficient with your time, these corrections can usually be entirely done during class. You also need to re–do your learning catalytics questions as a team after you do it individually, and have to make sure that you get at least 50% correct.Projects:the other half of class is spent on either project prep in the lab or ""skill session"" activities in which you learn skills specific to your project, e.g. arduino coding. your projects and skill sessions can usually be done entirely within the allotted class time, it's great. The projects are pretty relaxed since you have time to work on them during class, as long as everyone in your group pulls their weight, then it's a breeze. I got lucky with great groups (they're randomly assigned) but you can always communicate to the course staff if you're struggling. The final project was much shorter than the 2 semester projects, which meant that the class was done before reading period. Attendance:you have the option to complete your team homework reviews on zoom if some members are sick, but usually always have to be in person for the project/skill session stuff anyways so you basically need to attend every class, but the course staff are pretty understanding if you can't make it for some reason, so just keep in touch with them if you miss anything.Grading: You're required to submit pretty much all of the assignments in order to get an A in the class, but because you're not graded on correctness for the work you complete outside of class, this automatically saves you a lot of stress/time compared to freaking out about psets at office hours. Absolutely prioritize filling out all of the surveys for the class throughout the semester. If you complete 2 specific surveys in the beginning of the semester and then 2 again at the end, you get 6 extra credit points that can be used to boost individual assignment grades. You can use this boost once in each category (so you can use two points to boost a challenge and a tutorial, but not two challenges). You also need to use one of these points if you missed a deadline and want to submit an assignment for credit. grading is based on a 3–point system; 0=no credit, 1=needs improvement, 2=A+, 3=super A+ (you can use 3's to boost 1's, also just once per category). I would try to save these for the end of the semester for when the content gets harder. You also have the option to just submit a redo request for an assignment that you already submitted that got a 0 or 1, which does not use up any of your extra credit points or 3's. IMO this is the best option because if you retain all of your 6 extra credit points, you can boost your letter grade.

The minimal barrier to entry is offset by the extensive amount of time you will spend on this class (both in the classroom and outside). With all of the assignments being done in a group format, a lot of times your grades are group dependent. There were several situations where I was paired with group members who did not care at all and ended up doing most of the work on a project which is really meant to be done by 4 people, causing immense stress. In addition, sometimes assignment expectations changed throughout the semester or were unclear. There were odd metrics to measure ""effort"" which were entirely arbitrary. While the professor, Eric, has a great vision for the class and wants students to just learn and get a hands on experience, many of the TFs attempt to make things more difficult than needing by altering guidelines that ruin the fundamental nature of the course (see measurements of ""effort""). I also believe the TFs may just be overworked, which could lead to less than pleasant interactions. Everyone in this class is stressed constantly.

Yes, there is a lot of weekly work that you have to keep up with, but I'd take it any day over trying to study for an exam a few days before a thesis deadline (your priorities might be very different if you arent thesising). It's important to note that (in my opinion) the content doesn't prepare you as well for the mcat the way that ps2/ps3 does, but if you're already studying for the exam then you kind of already learn the specific content that you need to know (i know a few people that took the mcat before enrolling in AP50B that just taught themselves that material from practice books). So, if mcat prep is your concern, i wouldn't be too worried.I was confused about the workload for this class going into it, so I'll explain below for anyone also confused or trying to balance out an already difficult courseload.Assignments:This class is almost entirely based on effort rather than correctness (but they know if you completely BS assignments or don't put any time into them, so don't do that). If you just put in 1–3 hours for each big weekly assignment (readings/learning catalytics = 1 chapter per week and ~12 multiple choice questions, desmos tutorial = 30 shorter questions, challenge = 3 long multi–step questions), and spread it across several days, then it's super manageable and flexible to work with (cramming is also doable but just more exhausting lol). It's just like psetting but without the crying. I used to spend way too much time on assignments in the beginning of the semester, but once you get used to the flow of it and get a better feeling for student expectations, then it's much easier to work more efficiently. then, during one half of class (2x a week) you're expected to meet with your team and review your responses, discuss them with a TF, and then receive the answer key and submit corrections/a short reflection for each tutorial and challenge. If you're efficient with your time, these corrections can usually be entirely done during class. You also need to re–do your learning catalytics questions as a team after you do it individually, and have to make sure that you get at least 50% correct.Projects:the other half of class is spent on either project prep in the lab or ""skill session"" activities in which you learn skills specific to your project, e.g. arduino coding. your projects and skill sessions can usually be done entirely within the allotted class time, it's great. The projects are pretty relaxed since you have time to work on them during class, as long as everyone in your group pulls their weight, then it's a breeze. I got lucky with great groups (they're randomly assigned) but you can always communicate to the course staff if you're struggling. The final project was much shorter than the 2 semester projects, which meant that the class was done before reading period. Attendance:you have the option to complete your team homework reviews on zoom if some members are sick, but usually always have to be in person for the project/skill session stuff anyways so you basically need to attend every class, but the course staff are pretty understanding if you can't make it for some reason, so just keep in touch with them if you miss anything.Grading: You're required to submit pretty much all of the assignments in order to get an A in the class, but because you're not graded on correctness for the work you complete outside of class, this automatically saves you a lot of stress/time compared to freaking out about psets at office hours. Absolutely prioritize filling out all of the surveys for the class throughout the semester. If you complete 2 specific surveys in the beginning of the semester and then 2 again at the end, you get 6 extra credit points that can be used to boost individual assignment grades. You can use this boost once in each category (so you can use two points to boost a challenge and a tutorial, but not two challenges). You also need to use one of these points if you missed a deadline and want to submit an assignment for credit. grading is based on a 3–point system; 0=no credit, 1=needs improvement, 2=A+, 3=super A+ (you can use 3's to boost 1's, also just once per category). I would try to save these for the end of the semester for when the content gets harder. You also have the option to just submit a redo request for an assignment that you already submitted that got a 0 or 1, which does not use up any of your extra credit points or 3's. IMO this is the best option because if you retain all of your 6 extra credit points, you can boost your letter grade. This class gives you so many opportunities to improve your grade.overall, i could not be more thankful that this class exists, and it is a certified premed senior spring course in my book after years of exam courses. The scheduling of the course may change next year so this is all just based on my experience, but the overall structure will stay the same and, if anything, just changes to make things easier for students.

The minimal barrier to entry is offset by the extensive amount of time you will spend on this class (both in the classroom and outside). With all of the assignments being done in a group format, a lot of times your grades are group dependent. There were several situations where I was paired with group members who did not care at all and ended up doing most of the work on a project which is really meant to be done by 4 people, causing immense stress. In addition, sometimes assignment expectations changed throughout the semester or were unclear. There were odd metrics to measure ""effort"" which were entirely arbitrary. While the professor, Eric, has a great vision for the class and wants students to just learn and get a hands on experience, many of the TFs attempt to make things more difficult than needing by altering guidelines that ruin the fundamental nature of the course (see measurements of ""effort""). I also believe the TFs may just be overworked, which could lead to less than pleasant interactions. Everyone in this class is stressed constantly.

Subir basically explained 3 weeks of a qft class in a 1hour lecture, and that left huge repurcussions in our understanding of the material afterwards. Serhii tried to fix that but I don't really know  whether that worked. moral of the story: DO NOT LET SUBIR LECTURE FROM SLIDES. my understanding of the course just rapidly dropped towards the tail end of the course because he jsut started speeding up exponentially, which wasnt great. but overall, i manage to keep coming back to his class because it is without a doubt that he is very entertaining to watchSerhii was good, he knows a lot of stuff, but he was sometimes incomprehensible. not sure whether its my fault or his. he also has a very strange sense of humour which i strangely appreciated. quite helpful sometimes for homework, but he likes to take off tons of points on the homework for very small things.",0.9886,,0.0,,0.0

Patrice is the BEST instructor I have ever had at my time at Harvard, and I say that confidently as a senior whose taken small/big, stem/humanities, seminar/lecture classes. They have an incredibly strong pedagogical approach, and the class community is super tight–knit, a result of Patrice's careful class curation, structure, and warmth. I have learned so much from our professor in terms of technical and creative ability; not only do I feel really confident in capturing the right shot, but I feel like the content and style of my photography has developed so much too! It's rare that you get to learn from a teaching staff that is so knowledgeable, compassionate, and creative. And in this class, you will have a once–in–a–lifetime opportunity to go wild with your creative endeavors, truly develop as a person/photographer/creative agent, and become comfortable with the entire photographic process from ideation to editing to curation. If Patrice is still leading this class, take it! Harvard desperately needs faculty like them who are able to do the tough work of growing you as a person across a million dimensions. Take this class if you are okay with slowing down to reflect, love snack time, and have the energy/capacity to dedicate a good chunk of your semester toward photography (hint: the key to good pics is time, not just the cool places you go). Take the class if want to take photos that are so much more than just iPhone/Instagram photography, want to get pushed outside of your comfort zone, and love specific feedback on both how you can take better photos technically and how to create photos that leave an impact. And definitely take this class even if you don't have prior camera experience (I came in with none), have never taken an AFVS class before (I didn't), or are worried that you aren't artsy enough (deeply personal/introspective/cultural work >>> avant–garde/modernist/inaccessible photos).

If you like working in small groups on worksheets instead of just sitting in a lecture, this is the course for you! I felt a lot more comfortable working in a smaller group to solve problems rather than just going into homeworks blind about what solving astrophysics problems entail. The midterm and final were barely like a test at all, the structure of them was essentially people come in to visit the course who have a wide range of backgrounds and in small groups you work to talk about the problems with them. As someone who always struggles on tests due to anxiety, I really enjoyed this method because it never felt like there was any negative outcomes. If you have trouble explaining a problem, another group member or even a CA/TF/Prof would help you out, which I really enjoyed since it felt more welcoming. The problems sets were a bit all over the place in terms of difficulty, but the CAs and TFs were super helpful in answering questions and helping out.

The problems literally can only be solved if you make dumb simplifying assumptions. And more importantly, THE TEACHING STAFF DOES NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. Our own professor along with the CAs/TFs are so confused all the time. It's like they're trying to learn the material at the same time as we are. Every class, they are woefully unprepared and it affects the students' learning negatively because how are we supposed to understand the concepts if the teaching staff can't explain them to us if we have questions?

The HWs were a bit unstructured, and sometimes you don't get to complete a WS before going off to the next one. Hopefully this will be fixed in future years, since this was the first year some of the HWs were issued. I think it's a gem grading wise, since the TFs are very lenient and you shouldn't really worry about your final grade.

This course is very doable and enjoyable, especially if you do not have many pset classes. Presentations at the end of class were not too stressful.

You will not regret it one bit. 1) Your grade will be ok/about the same in both classes. A lot of people (pre–meds) worry about their grade and think that Chem20 might give them a worse grade than Chem17. The reality is that most students in both classes end up with A/A–. Chem20 has harder exams/lower exam averages, but your final course grade is curved, so it turns out perfectly fine. 2) You get a deeper understanding of chemistry with Chem20. Chem20 takes the time to introduce MO theory immediately and goes into greater depth on why each reaction you learn happens. It begins to teach you chemical intuition so that you can look at a molecule and immediately have some idea of its reactivity. In short, the course teaches organic chemistry by logic and reasoning rather than sheer memorization. 3) The course materials are FAR superior to Chem17 or ANY course you've ever taken. I'm not kidding. The course is so organized that you get 2 booklets on day 1: a bound booklet of the lecture notes that you fill in during lectures and second, a book of practice questions for each module of material. The exams, problem sets, and practice questions are all similar, so definitely do the practice questions. There are so many practice questions that mimic the conceptual and the synthesis questions on the actual exams very well. 4) Lab is actually sort of fun. The head lab TF Dominic will hopefully still be there. Dominic and Co. make lab super chill but still informative. The course  is a bit weird in that lab doesn't seem to count a lot towards your final grade, but imo, this actually helps you focus on lab and really enjoy learning the techniques (whether you end up using them in your future career or not).5) You get so much support. The TFs, PSLs, and ofc Professor Liu are all so willing to explain concepts/exam problems to help you improve over time. Actually, the best part is that you are assigned Pset groups with other students. This means that, unlike many other classes where you may struggle to find people to work with, you start the class with a pset group. ALSO after every exam, there is a group exam where you get to get some points back on the exam by working in another assigned group. The group is randomly assigned and changes each exam. This means that you get to know pretty much everyone in the class.Tldr: Take the course. Grade will be fine. You learn SO MUCH. All assignments are designed to prepare you well for exams/teach you a lot. You make many friends. Keep in mind that as we write these reviews, we have no clue what our final grade will be (that's the case for all classes). I've had some cases where I write positive reviews for classes, get a bad final grade, and regret writing that review. I'm here to say that regardless of my final grade (which again will be fine), I would 100% recommend this class to everyone who has any slight interest in chemistry at all.",0.9973,"I hesitate to write a negative review for this class. In all likelihood, if you’re reading the reviews for this class, you’re either a (prospective) chem/stem concentrator or premed: you’ll take this class, probably hate it, and despite failing all the exams you’ll get an A or A–. If you are not a stem concentrator or premed, though, do not take this class (particularly if Richard is teaching it).First: the course staff will constantly lie to you. The syllabus claims that this class is not curved—this is simply false. The cutoff for an A is essentially the 50th percentile, as they will release percentile results for each exam (and why would they do this if the class was not curved). On the topic of exams, they are inhumanely difficult. Average for the first exam was a D, average for the second exam was a 32. No matter how hard you study, these exams are designed to test intuition that a Nobel prize winner might have (literally… one question asked about results from a Nobel winning paper). After the second exam, it was confided to us by the teaching staff that the professor did not expect the low average. The class when we received the exams? The narrative has completely changed! We were told that we simply did not know how to study (rather, you were of course meant to do every single practice problem of the 200 page book; nevermind that you even might have other classes or exams to worry about), and that such a low average is to be expected and is a reflection that we had not fully mastered the material. It was extraordinarily disappointing.This class is not rewarding. Perhaps that is because organic chemistry is just not interesting. But lectures or homework do not even attempt to introduce interesting applications. You will memorize 100 reactions and their reagents, and that is about as rewarding as the class gets. The class description implies that this is a rigorous introduction to organic chemistry, but this is simply not true; reactions and mechanisms are just a question of memorization.Overall, this was probably the worst class I have ever taken. It is presented as so detached from the real world. No demonstrations given in class. Labs are completely disconnected from the material you are learning in class, and are more of an exercise in writing than they are actually interesting (you are expected to copy down the entire procedure, and you’re not even allowed to type it up). Teaching staff admit that they don’t even have the reactions memorized, and yet we are meant to learn it without any note sheets. If you are not a chem concentrator, do not take this class. Take a more interesting one like Chem 10 instead which will actually teach you things about the real world. If you are a chem concentrator, do not have a heavy course load when adding this to your schedule; you will spend lots of time on it.",-0.9799,,0.0

Previously, CHEM 27 had a reputation for being the “easier” course out of the 17/27 series, but this is seemingly no longer the case. Similar to Spring 2022, Professors Brian Liau and Sirinya Matchacheep lead the course and make an outstanding duo when it comes to lectures and accessibility. However, as a class, CHEM 27 falls short in many regards.First, CHEM 27 underwent a major change when it came to the grading system this semester, following numerous complaints from students during Spring 2022 since there were no set grade cut–offs and some complained about still getting B’s even when in the high 80’s or with a 90. To combat this, CHEM 27 enacted the same grading cut–offs as CHEM 17 from the Fall, but this came with major downsides. Most notably, it appears that the course staff attempted to compensate for the lower grade cutoffs by making the exams more difficult, but this was done to a huge extreme. Across all three exams, there were consistent complaints across the entire course about the questions being unreasonable or too difficult. This was especially the case for Exam 3, where a single mistake on a multi–step mechanism cost students 7 out of 14 points for the entire question, or where one single mechanism accounted for 24 points (out of a 100 point exam). To close off an already horrendous semester, the final exam was an absolute train wreck and included questions that used mechanisms that we were very familiar with, but that required applications in ways different from the general steps we learned in class. Leaving the exam, every single individual appeared to be extremely distraught and stressed, and for a class that consistently talks about “having no curve,” this was genuinely the most hurtful and demoralizing way to end the term.Outside of the awful exams, similar to CHEM 17 in the fall, CHEM 27 also made a fundamental change to the grading scheme for the class that took away the 1 allowed exam drop under Grading Scheme 2. At its core, the exam drop, outside of being a saving grace for many students, was also a great tool to help students adjust to the rigor of the class and better balance the playing field. For students that come from privileged backgrounds and/or that went to really prestigious high schools, many have already taken Organic Chemistry and have already been exposed to the material. However, for students that are coming in with a less prepared background, especially those that are first–generation, low–income, this makes the playing field very uneven, as they often have a harder time adjusting to the material. To make matters worse, the exam drop partially existed in the form of an excused exam for students facing “health issues” or other emergencies that prevented them from taking an exam. In reality, this ended up being a loophole for some students who attempted to avoid taking harder exams by coming up with a fake reason for needing to visit HUHS (since all that’s needed is a proof of visit). For students that decide to maintain academic integrity, this significantly affects the level of equity present within the course, and is something the course staff seriously need to address.Lastly, compared to CHEM 17, CHEM 27 appeared to suffer from many issues on the teaching staff side. Practice Exams are written by the Head TF’s and the teaching team (excluding the professors) and were often an inaccurate indicator of what we needed to know for the actual exam. At times, questions were so hard that Professor Matchacheep directly told students to avoid stressing over it, or course–wide announcements were made to ignore specific questions. It was the worst when questions randomly applied procedures or steps that we had never previously learned and had no relevant nature to our class or exam. This was especially heightened around the Final Exam, when multiple corrections were made to the Practice Finals within the last 24–48 hours leading up to the real deal, which only adds more stress to the lives of students.Ultimately, if you’ve come this far, CHEM 27 is likely a course you will have to take, regardless of if you want to or not. While the course content and structure were extremely poor, the one benefit definitely comes in the form of Professor Matchacheep and Professor Liau. Together, the two constitute one of the strongest teaching duos I have had thus far at Harvard, and are both extremely willing to listen to student feedback. As awful as the course is, this at least made it a little more tolerable, especially given their positive energy and attitude. At the end of the day, CHEM 27 will definitely be a difficult course, but to any future students, PLEASE take advantage of all the different opportunities that this class has to offer, ESPECIALLY in terms of Office Hours, Help Room, PSL Tutoring, etc. GOOD LUCK!",-0.9916,,0.0

Ted also really cares about the class, and his dry sense of humor can be very funny (once it stops being scary). He puts a lot of time and effort into the class, and you can feel it as a student. He is also super accessible outside of class. He is of course super super knowledgeable and passionate about the subject as well. If you do not HAVE to take this class, I likely wouldn't recommend it. I walked away feeling like I learned very little about chemistry. It did not really give me any fundamental understanding on a molecular level nor did I learn how to predict reactions, etc. I don't even feel much more confident reading papers about inorganic chemistry. On the other hand, Chem 20/30 were super useful and I felt like I learned a lot of practical skills and gained way more understanding during both those semesters.",0.9945,"Read the last paragraph for what you actually care about, which is deciding wether to take this class or not. .Now..sigh...let me tell you. This is a list of things that can be improved about this class: 1. Ammend the content of the lectures to actually be relevant to the material being tested. 2. Ammend the answer keys so that they make sense with the content of the class and that they are coherent with each other. There were SO MANY incoherent answers and poorly worded problems for the psets, section and exams. This class was draining to try to figure out, energy that should be put into actually learning content. 3.  Hire PSLs to actually have enough teaching staff to help the students. Having no PSLs is crazy. 4. Teach the material in a more rigorous way, go through the material that matters more thoroughly, which can be accomplished by getting rid of all the extra material that wasn't relevant at all for the psets and the exams. 5. Make the TFs understand the material. Even they were lost sometimes with what was going on. 6. Establish clearer goals on what needed to be learnt and try to organize the class around that, instead of making the students figure out what is actually important based on what the professor wants.7. Allow more questions in a more open way. Many questions were discouraged or answered in a way that could make students not engage. I think the intention of the professor were good but overall questions that were based on curiosity, rather than just trying to get the answer for the pset, were constantly discouraged. I think this led to people getting disinterested in learning the material of the class and the class shifted to just trying to get the homework done and not thinking about the content more critically. The class overall was just not well prepared. I don't think this has anything to do with the teaching staff not caring, especially the professor and the head TF (and carina), but it is just evident that the class wasn't well thought out. I think the professor really wanted to make the class work but at some point it was just out of his hands because all the material was so bad. Very poorly organized, from the OH schedule to the content of the lectures. Very incoherent within itself. It was just a lost cause from the beginning because nothing really made sense, and there was SO MUCH content that was irrelevant. I think over 60% of the material in lecture was completly irrelevant. The only reason I understood the last unit of the class was because I took Chem30 and had already learned the reactions but I don't know how else you would figure it out. TFs sometimes were confused because also half of the class was whatever the professor said the answer was even if it was incoherent with things we had said before. THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART: Ted is no longer teaching this class next year so idk if all of that is information is actually relevant to you. Another professor (like Mason who will be teaching it in 2025) might be completely different because the truth is just that chem40 is not a class that is actually planned out well like other classes in the chem department (like chem20 and 30) that area actually very well organized and supported. If you are reading this for a future year when Ted is teaching it again I hope things are better planned out. I know this comment probably seems really bad but I wouldn't be afraid of the class if it is a requriement for you. Ted actually cares a lot when you get to know him, he can be very blunt and sarcastic and cynical but we could tell he cared, the class was just a mess, poorly planned and supported and he couldn't fix that by himself as the semester went by (even with the help of Jun, the head TF, which was great as well). Worse comes to worse you can actually just pass without learning that much from the class if you just go to office hours to figure things out for the psets. Just expect to put in the work in terms of time.",-0.9404,,0.0

Never before have I seen a course staff (Especially Heidi) who care so much about students. This semester we worked on molecular glue synthesis. I learned organic lab techniques (Biotage, HPLC, inert atmosphere, etc), but my bigger takeaways were with how synthesis research is done. We gave group meeting presentations, annotated spectra, and wrote supporting information for our compounds (like for a paper). The poster presentation at the end seemed daunting but each step was broken down and honestly was not too stressful because of the support the staff gave. You also have a Lab Partner to split most assignments with!!The science advocacy component of this class was cool and definitely do the DC trip if you sign up! Talking to staffers and congressmen/senators was a cool experience.I loved the community the class produces. The 10 students this semester really forged strong friendships in this class and this was a powerful experience.Advice: do as much of the work/assignments in class so you can ask any questions if you are unsure or get stuck. You can leave the lab early and go home, but I usually stayed till the end to finish the assignments and basically not have research work outside of class. Workload is very fair for this class.Side Note: Chem 135 (experimental synthetic organic chemistry) is taught alongside Chem 100r. Chem 135 is a smaller and faster–paced course with more advanced labs, but does not have the science advocacy component (this may change) and also at least in this iteration of the course was less project–based. Students in Chem 135 tend to have more organic research experience, though it is not necessary by any means and the TFs will help you if you don't in either class!",0.9941,,0.0,,0.0

We spent a lot of time on derivations which I guess is nice if you're super interested into the why and how of certain formulas that we learn, but I wasn't. That wasn't on the exams though so I appreciated that but some psets used info from the derivations so we definitely didn't learn them for nothing so if you're interested in derivations there's that. The TFs were great at letting us know what the key concepts were to review while studying for exams which was useful because we cover a lot. There's no final in this course which was much appreciated, just two exams (a midterm and a 'final' that was only on the 2nd half of the course on the last day of class). The practice tests were so so so useful in preparing and the grading, at least for this past year, was generous which was nice given the difficulty of the exams. The problem sets were sometimes very difficult but having a good pset group and going to office hours should put you in a good place to do well. I personally wasn't super interested in statistical thermodynamics (and this course didn't change that) but it taught me what I'm supposed to know and I didn't suffer that much which is all I was really hoping for. There are actually a lot of chemical applications which was helpful to contextualize all of the math and stats. Overall this was actually one of the better classes of my semester and I'd definitely recommend it if you need to fulfill the physical chemistry requirement. Prof Zhuang was a great professor (and actually being IN the lecture hall for lecture will do you a world of good in terms of understanding the material, forming a pset group, and just generally increasing good faith between yourself and the teaching staff/Prof Zhuang) and Carl and Vaibhav were great TFs. I didn't have a strong math background (only took 21a/equivalent my freshman fall and took this course my junior spring) so I got frustrated at times but the TFs were really nice in explaining some math concepts at office hours and otherwise I was fine so don't be too worried if you don't have a stats/math background.",0.999,,0.0,,0.0

As a whole, CHEM 166 was definitely an interesting introduction to various aspects of quantum chemistry and physics, especially as it relates to topics like superconductors, topological insulators, magnets, and more. Professor Xu is a very talented instructor that has a clear passion for the field, and is also generous enough to provide Papa John’s pizza once/week for students! (a clear highlight throughout the semester)Within the CHEM department, CHEM 166 is definitely a relatively gemmy course when it comes to workload and time commitment. Outside of the twice/week lectures and once/week section (which only starts after spring break), there are no Problem Sets or Exams. Instead, the class is structured around a group project where groups of 3–4 present on primary literature related one of the topics taught about in class, and subsequently turn in a two–page paper reflecting on said topic. Following this, instead of a Final Exam, the class has instead opted for a Final Project, which is a simple one–page paper using DFT to calculate the band structure of a material. Overall, it is obvious that the focus of the class lies in learning about the content and truly enjoying the material. In my opinion, the only downside is that the concepts can occasionally be harder to digest for students without as strong of a background in chemistry and/or physics, as a lot of lectures relate back to deriving formulas and theories. Overall, the only downside to this course relates back to the fact that no grades are provided for the group presentation, and that the group paper and final project are not due until the end of exam period. As a result, it is hard to gauge where you stand in the class, especially when it comes to deciding final letter grades since there are no assigned cutoffs. However, CHEM 166 remains an outstanding course overall.As a whole, CHEM 166 is definitely a great class and is one worth time and consideration for any aspiring CHEM concentrators!",0.985,,0.0,,0.0

The  class seems easy with only 2 psets and 2 take–home exams. The problem sets were okay, but the take–home exams took up basically the entire 24 hours we were allotted for them which is unacceptable. The TFs also graded the exams and problem sets VERY harshly. Problem sets and exams weren't even related to material we learned in lecture. There's no final which again, seems nice. But there was a group project in which our group members were assigned to us. People's experiences of course will vary, but everyone I talked to in the class had negative experiences with group members either not wanting to work on the project at all or changing up the entire focus of the project the morning of the presentation without speaking to anyone about it. I don't understand why we couldn't just choose our own groups or have a final project that could be completed individually or in a group with the group option being more work in total since there are multiple people. Lecture was incredibly boring. Professor Woo isn't a great lecturer and the TF who lectured when she was out, Hannah, was even worse. Again, the questions on the problem sets and exams weren't things we learned in lecture, which was mostly poorly explained theory, and instead were really practical applications and experimental design. I don't understand how this kind of a class can even happen in the chem department, every other class I've taken has been significantly better than this (not saying they've all been amazing, but even mediocre classes are more manageable than this). Section was useless. We attempted to go over the assigned scientific papers for the week but never finished. Everyone was checked out and I felt like it was just a waste of my time. The TF also wasn't super engaging in section. I'd rather we just reviewed lecture concepts (or actually learned something that would be on the test) as opposed to analyze figures in papers that I would forget the moment I stepped out of the room. Every other chemistry class uses section time to go over course material I don't get why this class should be any different. I often felt, during lecture especially, that this course is NOT for undergrads and should be taken by 2nd year graduate students who've worked in a lab for years. There's a weird amount of basic BASIC stuff that's explained to you that I felt was unnecessary, but then other really complicated stuff that was just assumed knowledge and never gone over. I got the same sense when I went to Professor Woo's tenure talk. I figured that was just because she was lecturing to such a wide variety of people and that she'd be a better lecturer when she's teaching, but after taking the class I realize I was wrong. Maybe Professor Woo should look at how other chemistry classes, like 160 and 161, are taught. I was baffled by the fact that I could be more successful in courses on quantum mechanics and statistical thermodynamics no problem but have a negative experience in a chemical biology course. But really, what makes the most impact on a student's learning and their success in a class is the structure of the course. Having easily accessible office hours, having consistent, MANAGEABLE problem sets, exams that don't suck the life out of you and consume your every waking minute for 24 hours, engaging lecturers, useful sections. These are all things that chem 170 did not have but that I really wish it did. Kinda sad that this course sucked, I had higher hopes but here's hoping it gets better.",-0.9455,,0.0

If you fall into the category of those who find Classics often feels overly dry and stymied, this class will definitely shatter those illusions. In the final third of the semester, the course turns to a more reception–based angle, looking at modern writers whose work chimes with Lucian's in some way (politically, stylistically, etc.) and thinking about how those writers might be used theoretically to read Lucian. All in, if you want to read around in a lesser–known but really interesting Greek writer, and to sharpen your approach to classical and postclassical literature more broadly, then this will be an excellent course to take.",0.9808,,0.0,,0.0

Prof. Dourou went above and beyond, often bringing in her children's toys to make it possible for us to learn the language in the most memorable, fun ways possible. Amongst the fun lesson plans, there were also lesson plans that were effective and actually felt like they helped build a community in the class. When we read stories from the Greek textbook, we actually got very invested in the characters of the story, and some students would often be the reader/speaker for the same characters. We watched a lot of Greek ads, and the ads were very memorable often having a storyline as well. To make the ads an even better lesson plan, we would have competitions on who can spot out the relevant words in the ad first. Absolutely amazing class.

I took 124 as a freshman with the following preparation, and I was able to do pretty well in the course with a cracked pset group, begging for answers at office hours, regular section attendance, and a lot of grinding:High school math up to multi and linear but they were not rigorous at allSome small coding projects in high schoolMath 22a with Cliff TaubesCS50Self–studied discrete math over winter break based on the CS121 websiteNO competition math or competitive programming in high schoolNO CS120 or Stat110I don't think the amount of preparation you have coming into the class is super important as long as you are comfortable with math proofs, know discrete math (more or less), and know how to code. The biggest challenge in this course is how quickly you can process new information and how much time you can spend on the course –– it is very fast–paced, so you will have a lot of very difficult information thrown at you in a very short period of time. If you are able to either learn quickly or put in the effort to understand each of the topics, not taking Stat110 or CS120 will not cause you to fail this course.My advice for future students taking this class:KEEP UP WITH SECTION EVERY WEEK! This is super super important. Sections help you understand the algorithms conceptually, understand what the process of running them looks like, and learn relevant information for the week's pset. There have been countless times when I was completely lost after a lecture and then everything clicked when I went to section. The 124 TFs are really good teachers. Take advantage of that. Find a section that works well with your learning style and stick with it. If you absolutely have to miss a week, make sure you watch the section recording.GO TO OFFICE HOURS. Office hours are invaluable in this course. Make sure you go to them to ask questions about the pset and inevitably to beg for the answers.MAKE SURE YOU THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND YOUR PSET ANSWERS. In my opinion, it's okay to work with a super cracked pset group and leech off of them/office hours for some pset answers. But it is SUPER important that you understand the solution and why it works. The psets are designed the way they are for a reason. They teach important conceptual topics/problem–solving strategies. The intuition behind them is very helpful for a general understanding of topics, and variations of pset problems may come up in exams. (One of the finals questions this year was pretty much just a reduction to an algorithm we had to give in a previous pset).MAKE SURE YOU DON'T FALL BEHIND. It is very easy to fall behind in this course, and it's very hard to catch back up when you do. If you are confused about a topic after that week's section, make sure to ask questions about it or figure it out as you work through the corresponding pset problem. I think understanding an algorithm conceptually is the most important thing, because once that makes sense, everything else will (more or less) fall into place after a lot more thinking. This will also help with problem solving on exam problems.CHECK AND USE ED. Ed is the platform we use to ask questions about lectures and psets. If you have a question, don't be afraid to use Ed. Either someone else already asked that same question or a TF or Prof will give you a very good answer. Also check what people ask about pset problems it can give you hints lol.Also we had a very good late–day policy this semester, so make sure you're utilizing those to keep yourself sane but also budgeting them so you still have enough by the end of the semester when all of your classes are hella busy.You will likely be pulling all–nighters to finish psets and you will likely feel a lot of imposter syndrome. I felt the same, but I feel like taking this class was 100% worth it. It's a grind, but the concepts you learn are so cool and important, and you will look back and realize how much more knowledge you've gained through just one class. You belong in this class. Good luck!",0.9988,"CS 124 was the bane of my existence this semester. Are you, like me, expecting to learn advanced data structures/algorithms and come out of this course being able to rip apart any technical interview with ease? Well, buckle up for a massive disappointment as instead of all that, you’ll be just doing an endless stream of tedious and mind–numbing theoretical proofs with the usefulness of a screen door on a submarine. The average pset is maybe 8 pages of yapping and proofs and 2 lines of code. The value–to–time spent ratio in this class sucked. It ensured that I would never see daylight or touch grass over the weekend, being confined to my dorm or various libraries to grind out the psets, for very little in return. Most importantly however, it forced me to sacrifice my physical health for a decent grade. Speaking of which…This course DOES NOT provide accommodations for documented illnesses. I emailed course staff in February because I got knocked out by a severe stomach bug for a few days and I was told “too bad, that’s why you get 12 late days.” Even though I had to go to the emergency room and my proctor had to watch me slowly hobble to CVS to load up on meds, I still had to work through a 102–degree fever for the next 3 days to furiously try to make up for the work I lost while writhing in agony just so I could submit no more than two days late. Those days consisted of repetitions of napping, popping Tylenol, working on the pset, and eating just enough to maintain what little energy I had. Why only two days late? Because course policy says that if you submit > 2 days late with illness, you’ll have the pset excused but “we will increase the weight of your exams to make up for the pset” which might sound good but the average exam mark is below 50% – it is NEVER WORTH IT unless you are too ill to even finish half the pset. I got sick later this semester with another 102 degree fever and I was already a bit behind even without illness so I just had to suck it up and work through my fever again with the highest productivity I have ever had while feverish, instead of focusing on recovery. I ended up spending an extra WEEK recovering.One of my friends was not so lucky. They had a more severe documented illness that prevented them from handing in a pset on time even with two late days. Course staff’s response? You get a zero.It may have helped if the psets were reasonable in this course, but sadly, that is not the case. They will generally be at least twice as hard as anything discussed in lecture and will take well over 10 hours. There is no hope in doing them yourself – you either go to OH religiously or have a good pset group. There is also a pset due on Housing Day eve that will screw you over if you don’t finish it early. Don’t procrastinate like I did, because then you’ll have to miss all the Housing Day festivities to work on Sitan’s new creations. Also, despite the difficulty, the median is around 90% because everyone goes to OH (so you need nearly perfect for a good “relative” score).The grading is also kind of sloppy sometimes, the rubric that they provide isn’t always clear (and the deductions are very harsh – some mistakes can net you 0%), and I’ve had to submit more regrade requests for this one class than I have in all my other classes combined. Don’t submit pseudocode unless asked – they don’t read or grade it at all. Also, beware of labeling pages on Gradescope: sometimes you will have to label problems 4a and 4c (not 4b), and if you make a mistake labeling, you lose 5 points per question (even on a 5 or 10 point question). I know someone who lost more points due to labeling than actual mistakes.As for exams, they are even worse. The instructors believe that only half the class should get an exam mark above 50%. You will probably be able to solve most of the exam questions, just not in 75 minutes. (EDIT: the final was a lot more reasonable and very Leetcode–y.) But at least the class is curved, right? Well CS124 has one of the worst curves in Harvard CS, with only 20% getting an A and 20% getting an A–.The lectures are okay (sometimes too handwavey), but sections are good. The pacing is really fast though, so you don’t explore algorithms in depth – for the DP unit, we really only talked about 0–1 knapsack and string problems before being thrown into the next unit.This course could have been good if they made the pset cadence longer (every ~2 weeks), added a major coding component to each one, and split the course into two semesters (with more depth and breadth). Or alternatively, it would have been nice if a CS 124 alternative that focused more on coding existed, but unfortunately, no such class exists at Harvard. I do not recommend this course and I do not recommend getting sick during this course, but sometimes we don’t have a choice in life.",-0.9866,,0.0

Don’t procrastinate like I did, because then you’ll have to miss all the Housing Day festivities to work on Sitan’s new creations. Also, despite the difficulty, the median is around 90% because everyone goes to OH (so you need nearly perfect for a good “relative” score).The grading is also kind of sloppy sometimes, the rubric that they provide isn’t always clear (and the deductions are very harsh – some mistakes can net you 0%), and I’ve had to submit more regrade requests for this one class than I have in all my other classes combined. Don’t submit pseudocode unless asked – they don’t read or grade it at all. Also, beware of labeling pages on Gradescope: sometimes you will have to label problems 4a and 4c (not 4b), and if you make a mistake labeling, you lose 5 points per question (even on a 5 or 10 point question). I know someone who lost more points due to labeling than actual mistakes.As for exams, they are even worse. The instructors believe that only half the class should get an exam mark above 50%. You will probably be able to solve most of the exam questions, just not in 75 minutes. (EDIT: the final was a lot more reasonable and very Leetcode–y.) But at least the class is curved, right? Well CS124 has one of the worst curves in Harvard CS, with only 20% getting an A and 20% getting an A–.The lectures are okay (sometimes too handwavey), but sections are good. The pacing is really fast though, so you don’t explore algorithms in depth – for the DP unit, we really only talked about 0–1 knapsack and string problems before being thrown into the next unit.This course could have been good if they made the pset cadence longer (every ~2 weeks), added a major coding component to each one, and split the course into two semesters (with more depth and breadth). Or alternatively, it would have been nice if a CS 124 alternative that focused more on coding existed, but unfortunately, no such class exists at Harvard. I do not recommend this course and I do not recommend getting sick during this course, but sometimes we don’t have a choice in life.",-0.9866,,0.0

The problem sets are all fairly short and very manageable. The team labs will take up the majority of your time in this class. The main advice I have: like in life, find a good partner, and get carried. These labs expect some familiarity with virtual environments and Git; they use a finicky coding language called SystemVerilog to implement hardware in a coding environment. Students are also given FPGA boards to program and test, which is quite neat. The labs are typically completed over multiple weeks, and especially at the start, involve a lot of setup and troubleshooting without extensive instruction.

I found the projects to be pretty fun overall.

It’s a pretty reasonable time commitment, and the value out for work in is excellent. This was my favorite class this semester.",0.9907,"I have very mixed feelings about this course. TL,DR;  just self–teach the course if you can, or at least take it with someone you know.On one hand, there is nothing wrong with the actual content. It's everything you would learn in a computer networking course. Also, the Professor is extremely insightful, if you know to ask the right questions.On the other hand, this is far and away the most disorganized course I've ever taken at Harvard. Several reasons:1.) This is mostly the fault of the problem sets. After a quick search online, you can see that most of them are straight–up copy–pasted from the Internet. This raises a red flag for me immediately: professors should design their own problem sets. Period — or at least modify them in a noticeable way. Not only this, but the programming assignments (psets) themselves are so janky, especially the ones with P4. Until at least static code checking is supported for P4, it is such a garbage language to focus on, even if it's the only open–source language that the majority of switches are programmed in. The whole point of the coding assignments, apart from the final project, should be to demonstrate that you understand the concepts. Every single one of the psets that relies on P4 (2/5, at least) misses this point entirely, and is focusing entirely on code semantics for a language with little–to–no online resources (apart, of course, from examples on Github ... oh wait, that's where the Pset comes from! You can just copy–paste them! But then what's the point of the pset???). 2.) I can get past P4, but what's absolutely bonkers to me is that these problem sets have not been updated in half a DECADE. Yes, you have to compile and write all of the problem sets in a Ubuntu Linux VM simply because the libraries are only supported by a Linux OS, and they are all deprecated ones, because they're compiled with Python 2!!!! I had to literally un–install python just to downgrade it.3.) There is no Ed presence whatsoever. The vast majority of questions asked by students either go unanswered (or answered by other students) far before the questions are every answered by a TF/the Prof. To my knowledge, office hours are also only held 1–2 times a week, during CS nights + some other day (idk, wasn't pubbed basically ever). I have nothing personal against the teaching staff, but that just seemed silly.4.) For whatever reason, this course is especially popular amongst international students and/or Harvard extension school students. I have no qualms with this whatsoever. However, it's annoying because the lectures are all recorded. This basically incentivizes no one to ever come to the lectures, because college students can also just watch them online. This leads to a complete void of course ""culture"", so unless you know somebody beforehand or exchange contact info within the first week, you're on your own.5.) Grading was at least a month late at all times. It is the last day of finals period, and one of our problem sets still is not graded (the penultimate was only graded a few days ago, after the final project's deadline). Expect to receive no helpful feedback, either. No code comments, none of that. The problem sets are more like an all–or–nothing type thing when it comes to points.6.) You can teach yourself literally all of the course content! Computer networks is one of the most self–teachable concepts in undergrad computer science, and all of the problem sets are straight from the Internet anyway. I thought that by taking this course, I could take advantage of the classroom setting to teach myself more than I already knew (which is somewhat substantial), but since the problem sets are all online anyway, literally what was the point of it all?",-0.9573,,0.0

A great follow–on after ES 152 and CS 141 (builds on knowledge of MOSFETs, RC, PN junctions, basic MOSFET amplifiers, combinational/sequential logic circuits). Course is based largely on Cadence Virtuoso simulations. Professor: Gage is an inspiring lecturer and is great at helping you build your circuit design intuition and general enthusiasm for circuits. I hope you enjoy more hundred–slide lecture note slides like 152. Textbooks: Not really used in the course but can be a good reference. Not too necessary to obtain on one’s own.Neil Weste & David Harris, CMOS VLSI Design: A Circuits and Systems Perspective (4th Edition)Topics covered: Lectures: Review of 152 (MOSFETs, mostly); Static CMOS logic gates, Dennard scaling; VLSI fabrication (substrate, deposit/etch/implant/growth/masks) and layout in Virtuoso (P/N wells, gate oxides, contacts, metal layers); wire RC, Elmore delay, parasitics; clocking, D Flip Flop schematic and layout, clock trees; 6T cells, SRAM memory (wordlines, bitlines, write driver, pre charge, sense amplifiers); I/O, pad ring, wire bonds, ESD protection, human body model; picture elements (pixels), PN junction review, photodiode IV curve, 4T pixel, possibly other lectures by course staff such as chip packaging, PCBs, and sustainable computing. Design Lab topics (subject to change year–to–year): MOSFET circuits, RC–timing, combinational circuits, power analysis, and human vs. machine comparison; MOSFET parameters/tradeoffs and Virtuoso maestro analysis; layout–level inverter/nand/nor/half–adder/full–adder design and simulation, layout vs. schematic (LVS), design rule check (DRC); testbenches, Cadence Genus/Innovus, automatically–generated circuits, place and route (PnR), simulated timing analysis; SRAM layout/schematic/maestro, wordline/bitline/write driver/precharge/sense amp, control signal waveforms, tiling; pixels, photodiodes, 4T pixel, control signal waveforms, tiling. Course structure notes: Design labs each week, mostly around Cadence Virtuoso. Design project for camera chip (248 students expected to do more). EE Mega–OH Wednesday nights (free dinner!). The workload is quite bursty, weeks varies between challenging grinding and catch–up. The course has amazing potential but the pacing definitely needs more adjustment; we got 6 design labs in and did not get to the final camera chip project, though I believe last year they got 4 design labs in.

I guess I should caveat that I took 165 the previous semester, and my experience there I think probably saved me a perhaps 1–3 hours on average per PSET, just from having some familiarity with GDB and instantly writing a good logging system (something I did way too late into 165, here it was the first thing I wrote and that was certainly a good decision).Eddie as always is a wonderful professor; he generally makes you think he has some boundless knowledge vault locked away in his head regarding everything related to systems. And we don't even need to talk about anything that follows `emacs –nw`. Anyone who writes such fabled characters in 2024 should probably either be worshipped or feared.Getting to build a reasonable sized portion of an operating system is awesome, the PSETs are obviously time consuming but honestly not even close to as overwhelming as I was expecting. I took this partly to build some familiarity with C++, and I definitely felt like I gained some of that, along with some good practice in GDB if either of those appeal to you.Overall, very much enjoyed, maybe a bit burnt out taking this and some other moderately time–consuming stuff in senior spring, but I'm not sure there's a better final assignment to hand in as a CS concentrator as your operating system final project (even if mine was pretty meh) and be able to call yourself done with Harvard :)",0.9967,"If you don't procrastinate, this may just be the best CS course at Harvard.

Although I had taken all the prereqs (and was taking stat 111 simultaneously), I started the class being very very confused. The class has notation that does not correspond to the notation used in stat 110/111 in very important cases. For example, they write N(x; mu, sigma2) to mean the pdf of the normal. The multivariate normal distribution (among other vector valued distributions) are just used without really an explanation of how they work. Note that none of the prerequisities teach multivariate distribution PDF  (stat 110 covers it with relation to its property that any linear combo of the entries will be normally distributed, not its actual pdf). You are just supposed to figure out the notation for the PDFs of these distributions. Have you ever had to write out the multivariate normal pdf? I certainly hadn’t, let alone understand the covariance matrix multiplication done in the pdf. You should be VERY familiar with Likelihood functions and likelihood maximization as a concept. This class is all about expressing the state/model/action we want in terms of some some loss/reward and then minimizing/maximizing it with respect to the variables we want to optimize. You WILL have to write likelihoods that involve many many sums and products over variables. Get used to it by practicing to write the likelihood functions for various distributions, joint distributions etc. You should be very familiar with converting your likelihood function to a log likelihood one. Familiarize yourself with the use of indicators in likelihoods to write likelihoods neatly instead of writing in terms of cases.  I HEAVILY recommend looking into derivative identities as it relates to matrices. How do you take the derivative w.r.t to a vectors or a matrix? how do you take derivatives of complex looking matrix multiplications such as v^{T}Av with respect to scalars, vectors etc. LOOK UP THE MATRIX COOKBOOK. memorize/understand how those derivatives work, at least have it saved in an easily accessible location. Put these in your cheatsheet too if possible. Finale and David are both fine lecturers, though I liked Finale better. Their lectures were not the worst (like hesterberg) but not the best (like Mickens). Not the most engaging for me. Its was the classic let’s just jump into it mentality where the teacher speaks for 60 minutes and attempts to transmit info to students. However, one must realize that an occasional joke or deliberately done diversion would go a long way towards keeping the lectures engaging. Please see James Mickens and ask for his wisdom in teaching.  One big feedback I want to give David is to preferably never say “After some SIMPLE computation, we get …” or its many variants. It’s one of the most demoralizing things to hear from lecturers. If the computation is elided for some x reason (such as too time consuming), say so. Say that it is in the book, so you won’t cover it here. However, saying that the topic is easy or simple doesn’t help anyone. Also, they should spend more time rehearsing their lectures and stop with the many erms, and umms. I find it extremely paternalistic to make attendance in lecture required. I do understand that the teacher teaching the lecture would feel that lectures are important. But why not let the students decide? Surely we are adults and we can make decisions according to our own situations. (Note that for Harvard students, the grade they get is pretty important, so they will usually do anything they feel is necessary to do well in a class).  For example, I lived in the quad and am not a good sleeper. Making it to my 9.45 am class is excruciating since I need more sleep than the average undergraduate here. Even in ideal conditions, i need to have at least 10 hours to function properly. Note that many assignments for classes are due at 11:59pm and so I can usually only sleep after that (among other reasons). Moreover, I am extremely skilled at listening to audio and watching stuff in high speeds (i.e 2.5–3.5x speeds) so it is mentally torturous for me to listen to people in real life speeds. Moreover, its impossible for me to take notes during lectures because the moment I focus on the notes, I miss the words said by the lecturers. Please please reconsider your attendance policy and have it be optional with perhaps a grade boost for attendance. I personally will literally forgo some attendance points to not attend lecture. I feel that strongly about my abilities as a student and in my conviction about lectures being bad. The two lectuers are not that good anyways, so why make lectures mandatory? What does attendance achieve that 2.5x panopto with me frequently stopping the video and taking notes doesn't achieve.  There will be conceptual understanding questions in the end of every lecture which are a great way to make sure you understand what was covered. A highlight of the class with very thought–provoking questions. If you end up watching the lectures, please acknowledge their value and actually do the conceptual questions before watching ahaid .   The psets are good. Each one makes you derive some results similarto those done in lecture and section. The coding portion of psets are VERY enjoyable, though that might be because I love coding myself :D You should familiarize yourself with numpy immediately and learn as many vectorized operations as possible. In the psets, you’ll have to write code that runs  for many iterations, so vectorizing is very important for getting reasonable runtimes. Sections were pretty meh. I tried a couple sections and it felt like the TFs were improvising rather having prepared for them. You know, these peers of mine are supposed to be the biggest advocates for the class and bring some energy into their section! Moreover, the sections felt extremely rushed since there were many topics to cover and the TFs were supposed to cover so much in so little time. Since it was impossible for the TFs to cover everything in the notes, perhaps more instructions on what was important would have been nice. For the rest of the material, perhaps they could have been shared separately. 181 is sort of a prestige class as in the class covers a topic that is very popular these days and thus gets a lot of students to take it. It is also hard enough to warrant consideration of what else you’re taking (See time spent above and estimate something similar for yourself). Again, comparison is the thief of joy and similar to my 124 review, there will be MANY people who are better than you. So come prepared for annoying student asking annoying questions. Also, for those of you who already know the stuff, you should know better than to be a smug p.o.s. Also, I went into the class expecting a lot of neural networks, but the class is more focused on different methods rather than exploring a given method/model well. So, come expecting that. Midterm 1 was extremely hard with the median being somewhere around 40. The second midterm was generally easier for everyone. Don’t be like me and definitely study more for the midterms, especially for the first. A score that is significantly above the median might make the class an almost guaranteed A range. The class doesn’t have many practice questions for midterms which makes the prep work for the midterms way harder. reading the textbook/ watching lectures is not an alternative to actual practice questions. I call upon the lecturers to create more if possible. The class does not release the exams afterwards and according to a TF, this is because “there is a limited number of questions that can be asked”. This is garbage. For two renowned professors, creating a new exam with similar material should be a piece of cake! Are the professors just planning, for example, to recycle a likelihood calculation question directly and replace the distribution to something else? I expected better. Meanwhile Stat 111 provides 5 years of finals and midterms. Stat 110 gives you almost 10 exams. The textbook, is a really good resource and I think should take precedence over the lectures for your studies. Some graduating senior wrote a better resource than the professors lol. The textbook has so much more detail and better explanations than the lectures. Make use of the textbook if at all possible. Use Speechify if you find reading hard like me. Overall, the class is probably a class with the most potential to be awesome but falls short. I am sad that I don’t go to MIT/ can’t take those classes for concentration credit. You know why they don’t allow concentration credit from MIT? Because I think they know that no one in their right mind would do the harvard version with inferior resources, inferior lecturers, and inferior department. The AI/ML faculty here really needs to step up their game. Make 181 better and revive 182 better than it once was. Know that the current situation is NOT preparing us for the upcoming future well. Also, trying to cover both supervised and unsupervised learning in one class leaves both topics shallowly taught. Consider a year–long course. You know what, I'm just going to say perhaps consider taking the MIT version of the class (especially if not a concentrator). Maybe its a grass is always greener on the other side situation, but this side certainly isn't a vibrant green. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",0.9995,"The worst class I have taken at Harvard. The lectures have terribly inconsistent notation, meaningless letters suddenly appear out of nowhere without explanation or is swapped with another, a superscript becomes a subscript later on, etc. etc. that makes the lectures very difficult to follow.

I'm not sure the problem sets or the lecture notes are double–checked beforehand – so many of these mistakes seem easily catchable if the course staff actually worked through/read through them first. For example, for a problem, there was a part asking us to add code to their handout code, when that handout code didn't exist. In another instance, the problem asked us to look back to a problem that also didn't exist, which became a confusing which–question–did–they–mean–to–write here game.

Some problems take 1 minute to earn 10 points, while another 10 point problem would take 45 minutes of bashing. So the exam instead becomes a min–max algorithm where you must find the easy problems and solve them first rather than a test to see if we understand the course material. And mistakes appear on the exam too – during the midterm, there was a typo on the very first sentence of the exam, which just shows how little the course material is proofread before it is released.Unless you must, do not take this course.

Unfortunately, CS 191 is my least favorite class. The course staff, particularly the more senior members, were slightly condescending throughout the course. I appreciate their wisdom and perspective from seeing CS from the true early days until now, but they consistently would make myself and my peers feels as if our points had no true bearing due to us “not being around back then.” There were many instances in which classmates’ ideas would be outright shut down or glossed over because they did not, in the course staff’s view, strictly adhere about discussion about the contents of the paper we were discussing. For something like one of the fundamental papers on AI, talking about ChatGPT, LLMs, or any more contemporary developments in the field (very arguably inspired by the paper in question) were considered “off–topic.” The conversation would then transition to members of the course staff speaking 90% of the time about how “it used to be.” To be clear, staff members lecturing about how things used to be is not bad in isolation (in fact, it’s actually pretty interesting!). The problem is that this comes at the expense of good discussion from students trying to do their best to contribute something based on their own perspectives (which I believe the course claims is a central part). Furthermore, most cases involve students being interrupted on the spot. Perhaps a takeaway here is that you only need to know the first five words of your discussion contribution when a staff member is at your table, as you will almost certainly get cut off at word #3.You have to submit reading responses for all the papers assigned. The final grade at the end is determined by a single creative video assignment. If you can imagine, the grading is extremely subjective and falls onto how “convinced” the teaching staff (the same staff aforementioned) feel about your argument. Generally, they will award an A, A–, or B+. However, it is up to you whether or not you want to play that game.There are some positives about CS 191. Professor Lewis is a legend in the field and it was wonderful hearing his insights. It was cool to see a broad history of CS through the papers and my discussion groups were great student–wise, so discussions were generally enjoyable. However, this is not enough in my opinion to recommend people take CS 191, especially since there are so many more interesting courses (both in CS and beyond!) available. For something more technical, look at another CS courses. For something more on the humanities side, consult any department other than CS!",0.9975,Your experience in this class will really depend on who’s in the discussion group.

The guest lecturers are Turing award winning geniuses, and Harry's mini–lectures at the start of class are great; you should close your laptop and pay attention because they do such an amazing job at concisely summarizing the importance of that week's papers.",0.9856

I don't usually write long reviews but I have to give KB and Brian their flowers. They are the absolute BEST teaching team and this class was the best I have ever taken at Harvard. They create a delightful classroom environment (warm, engaging, creative, relaxed, fun) and their focus on learning as a journey rather than a destination with set checkpoints allows you the space and freedom to fully explore your interests as you work on your semester–long project. The work load is super manageable as class only meets once a week and depending on your personal project, you choose how much time you put in. And you end up putting in the time because the work is so fun! The weekly design cases are so interesting to read and the collaborative classroom culture allows you to participate in other people's projects and be inspired by their work as well. There are no tests or exams, just the semester long project, but the course has plenty of built in check–ins and scaffolding to keep you on track. This class single–handedly made me excited to be a CS concentrator again (burnout is so real) and introduced me to the Education Studies department which I will now be taking more classes in.

Before this class, I always hesitated to get into the weeds with the various fairness definitions, but now after this class I feel comfortable with the workings behind many of the popular fairness frameworks and how they are motivated/work. You get exposed to lots of material, covering everything from individual and group fairness, learning complexity, regularity, multicalibration, outcome indistinguishability, omniprediction, better worlds, and simulations for real–world ideas, etc. In both the lectures and psets, you get very hands–on to the theory. The course gave me more confidence in understanding the roots of algorithmic fairness, and made me appreciate the overall hardness of the field. The course certainly builds your mathematical skills to understand various complex definitions and theorems. While the content is intimidating, the instructor does her best to make you feel welcome in discussion, and is intent on helping you understand.",0.9863,"This course is a pretty awfully executed course, among the worst I've taken at Harvard. While other bad classes can be due to tardy feedback, just the entire structure, content, and delivery of CS 226R was extremely poor. First of all, the readings were probably connected somewhat to the lectures, but the lectures were in no way connected to anything else in the course. It didn't really feel like any of the lectures were necessary for any other part of the course and oftentimes the lectures were very theoretical with limited application or practical reasoning. Sure, probably some were, but they were later in the course at which point almost everyone disengaged from the course. The course generally felt somewhat oriented toward causing suffering among students. This may be in part due to the professor feeling that students did not do the readings because she asked once a question and no one responded after which she never really recovered after that lecture. It almost was a course in which people could pass by not learning from the lectures and not doing the readings, because the only thing substantive in the course really was psets. I guess this means that this is a course where we learn as much as we put in, though at the point that the psets take so long, it is impossible to really even put in much more and learn anything. The psets were all rather insufferable because they had almost no practical or even theoretical significance, and not only that but they also were excessively long, often taking 20–30 hours per pset; they appeared way more to just be exercises in mathematical manipulation of inequalities that does not even lead to any deeper theoretical understanding. It was also another of those CS courses that kind of just needed answers from the TFs during office hours and pset groups are very important to being able to ever finish. The psets also just took so long and clashed with times like week before spring break where many midterms were; though at least there were late days. She did seem like a nice person during the one discussion we had, but otherwise, it felt like the course was meaning to be burdensome to students. For example, with 3 weeks left in the course, she implemented a sign–in sheet for students, even though nowhere on the syllabus was there any indication of why she would do such a thing, and it is unclear whether it will affect the grade — if it was for psychological purposes I would not consider that ethical and if it were for a grade, I would also not consider that ethical given that no changes to the syllabus were made and no changes to grading policy were announced in class. The class also did not have many interesting lectures but rather felt like no one was engaging except a handful of people, because of the abstract nature of the content covered. While Prof Dwork is certainly very knowledgeable, she doesn't really convey the knowledge very well and even at times appears to get lost in her tracks when doing mathematical steps during lecture, leaving the room in silence for around a minute. The only part of the course that was remotely enjoyable was the final project because of the freedom it allowed in exploring different topics with at least some practical significance, so I had some interesting results from that. Really the only people who would enjoy this course would be people who really are interested in theoretical CS at the level of not really ever touching the ground. I think also the large class size, which necessarily leads to less committed and more disengaged members, was part of the cause of the poorly run nature of the class, which also discouraged the professor and may have contributed to a structure that I think almost everyone disliked. But maybe the bad ratings here will lead to a smaller class, which may be more enjoyable for some.",-0.9801,,0.0

A great follow–on after ES 152 and CS 141 (builds on knowledge of MOSFETs, RC, PN junctions, basic MOSFET amplifiers, combinational/sequential logic circuits). Course is based largely on Cadence Virtuoso simulations. Professor: Gage is an inspiring lecturer and is great at helping you build your circuit design intuition and general enthusiasm for circuits. I hope you enjoy more hundred–slide lecture note slides like 152. Textbooks: Not really used in the course but can be a good reference. Not too necessary to obtain on one’s own.Neil Weste & David Harris, CMOS VLSI Design: A Circuits and Systems Perspective (4th Edition)Topics covered: Lectures: Review of 152 (MOSFETs, mostly); Static CMOS logic gates, Dennard scaling; VLSI fabrication (substrate, deposit/etch/implant/growth/masks) and layout in Virtuoso (P/N wells, gate oxides, contacts, metal layers); wire RC, Elmore delay, parasitics; clocking, D Flip Flop schematic and layout, clock trees; 6T cells, SRAM memory (wordlines, bitlines, write driver, pre charge, sense amplifiers); I/O, pad ring, wire bonds, ESD protection, human body model; picture elements (pixels), PN junction review, photodiode IV curve, 4T pixel, possibly other lectures by course staff such as chip packaging, PCBs, and sustainable computing. Design Lab topics (subject to change year–to–year): MOSFET circuits, RC–timing, combinational circuits, power analysis, and human vs. machine comparison; MOSFET parameters/tradeoffs and Virtuoso maestro analysis; layout–level inverter/nand/nor/half–adder/full–adder design and simulation, layout vs. schematic (LVS), design rule check (DRC); testbenches, Cadence Genus/Innovus, automatically–generated circuits, place and route (PnR), simulated timing analysis; SRAM layout/schematic/maestro, wordline/bitline/write driver/precharge/sense amp, control signal waveforms, tiling; pixels, photodiodes, 4T pixel, control signal waveforms, tiling. Course structure notes: Design labs each week, mostly around Cadence Virtuoso. Design project for camera chip (248 students expected to do more). EE Mega–OH Wednesday nights (free dinner!). The workload is quite bursty, weeks varies between challenging grinding and catch–up. The course has amazing potential but the pacing definitely needs more adjustment; we got 6 design labs in and did not get to the final camera chip project, though I believe last year they got 4 design labs in.

Time Statistics:I kept strict track of time spent on everything productive I did over the semester.

Because of the schedule I had, I had so little time to actually dive deep into the topics in this class. This summer, I am definitely going back and doing a deeper dive. Every time I did the readings in the last hour, I knew that it was literally the only time I had, but also felt so much guilt since the lectures were made so much more clearer once I had read the paper. Professor Mickens, I am so sorry. The week to week of this class is not very time consuming as seen by the time data. Most weeks, there is only lecture and readings. The main time consumers for the class are the projects, both the pset ones and the final project. In order, the psets project topics are Buffer Overflows, Reverse Engineering, and Sandboxing. Since I knew that there were three projects, I recorded their time seperately. You can easily tell which weeks the psets were due above. The projects take some hefty time, so do not start on the last day like mine. The penalty is 10 percentage points per 16 hours of lateness for the first project and per 8 hours of lateness for the remaining psets. Look into ghidra for the reverse engineering pset. Look into VSCode ssh'ing into your AWS EC2 instance for project 1. The terminal, even with TMUX is not what I prefer. I had 4 VSCODE tabs/sections in one window each with a different terminal open. Have all the terminals you need open side by side so you can rapidly switch. I heavily recommend creating a custom gdb layout and making that the layout that gdb uses using .gdbinit. For project 3, look into the ptrace hint and read it fully before attempting the project. This is definitely a ""you get what you put in"" kind of class. The per–class paper responses are fairly easy to complete, especially if you have a fast reading speed or use a text–to–speech software like me. You should expect to spend about 30 minutes on the readings for the barest of minimums of understanding. 1–2 hours is better and you'll finish the papers and most likely understand a lot of the content within (perhaps a nice Goldilocks zone here). You should about 3–4 hours (over possibly 2–3 sessions) each week to really digest the material and have some followup prepared for Prof Mickens. He is EXTREMELY knowledgable about all parts of the course material.Prof Mickens' Office hours just after class are an amazing resource. You can ask him anything you'd like (not just about the course topics) and spend some amazing time learning the material. He received tenure fairly recently, but I am sure that he is/will become a legend of the field. He is certainly a legendary lecturer. I do not say this lightly. He is the BENCHMARK for any other class I take now and no one comes even close. In a way, he has ruined every single other CS class at harvard through his raising the bar so high. The course feedback is extremely late by even other class standards. I think we got the first pset back when 80% of the semester was done. I got my second and third pset grade about 3–4 days ago end of semester. Since each pset is so unrelated to the rest of the readings, lectures, and projects, it actually doesn't affect you if you do get a good or bad grade, but still, perhaps the course can improve the time to feedback. This is a grad class, and so office hour support is comparatively low. There were just two TFs and a total of 4 office hours. They were also held middle of the day, so prepare to not be able to make 1–2 of them. Unfortunately, I think the two TFs had the same time for one of their office hours which makes one unattendable by design. I forget if that time arrangement continued for the second and third psets. During the weeks with no projects, there are only office hours by Prof Mickens. The Ed Board is fairly active and you can expect to get an answer in about 1–2 days. Don't expect fast responses from the staff and plan accordingly. Perhaps form a mini study group for discussions. I didn't have one for the first two projects and it severely affected me (though they were hard projects to begin with).  Overall a solid S tier class. If you liked CS61, this is a natural class to take. If you only have CS61, you can still take the class. Your coding experience will be enough. However, I think you should have more experience with gdb as my gdb experience from CS61 was not enough I think. To that end, the gdb guide that Prof Mickens posted is really helpful.",0.9955,,0.0,,0.0

They randomly decided to add an assignment that wasn’t on the syllabus halfway through the semester, constantly loosened/tightened requirements and deadlines, and were too vague about assignments. An example: at 3pm on the day of the final project deadline, they sent an email clarifying that an 8–page paper meant “maximum 8 pages” and insisting that we cut our papers to that length if they were longer. Seriously?– The assignments can be poorly thought through — insensible page counts, back–to–back deadlines, paper responses that prompt zero originality or discussion (these ended up being 300–word summaries where everyone says the same thing and nobody cares to read what anyone else wrote).",0.9831,"Don't take this class.

Dave always stops to ask if we don't understand anything and is really big on the whole there is a no dumb question thing. I really appreciate it as someone who doesn't have the best background for this kind of thing. I wished we had powerpoints and slides that can help with understanding because sometimes the lecture material seems to be sprouting from Dave's mind, and Dave is going to get it because he has a PhD but that leaves in a wild loop. The psets were different from the material taught in class because we are asked to deal with real data sets, which is really cool, but also really jarring considering that class only goes over the fundamental concepts. You would need to go to office hours to really understand what to do for the questions that require special equations. If I were to be totally honest, I think I can only apply those equations to the problems that I saw on the psets and it would not be applicable anywhere else, but still very cool regardless. Haley is very cool with grading and helps my understanding a lot with her comments. Haley will not be TFing this class anymore though because SHE GOT HER PHD and is too cool for school now.

Noh 선생님, Lindsay 선생님, and You 선생님 were all fantastic teachers. They all teach well, are approachable, and are understanding. I hope for the future 120B classes they reduce the amount of homework. We already meet every day. But in a typical Korean 120B week we had multiple vocabulary quizzes, an essay, a recording project with a partner, a one on one speaking practice zoom call, workbook homework (like 4–5 pages per), and of course every few weeks a lesson test. I only complain because I feel like a lot of the work was unnecessary and unhelpful towards progressing my language skills. Mostly everything about lecture and section was super positive. Section is super fun and more fun than lecture becuase its a smaller class size and so you have more opportunity to talk with your peers, etc. But that's kind of the point of section vs. lecture. Lecture they want to drill into your head like 2–3 grammar concepts and then section they want you to practice those grammar concepts with others.The vocabulary quizzes became pretty hard from 120A to 120B. They essentially became grammar quizzes and we all know grammar is harder than vocabulary to ""study"" for. 120B they introduced full sentence completion and more nuanced, ""trap"" grammar questions. 120A vocabulary quizzes were straightforward to study for and easy to bag 10/10s on but I found that in 120B they became complicated to prep for and I was getting 7/10s even though I put in the same studying effort as 120A. Overall I kinda had to take this class as I had already taken 120A in the Fall and planned to do 120B in back to back semesters. But if someone had told me in advance that the jump from 120A to 120B in terms of attention to detail and workload was a thing, I would've been appreciative.",0.9954,"Definitely worth taking to continue on with the language – Professor Noh and the TFs are amazing!!

OH is appointment only and rare lunches are lotteried. The structure makes little sense. Is this course about coding or understanding the studies and social issues in America? As someone wrote on last year’s Q, this course tries to do both and ends up doing neither.The psets do zero and are just everyone scrambling to copy and get answers from one another or teaching staff. There’s just little explicit connection between what we do in lecture and the work itself, which is tedious and teaches little.Oh, and the exams are torturous: asking about minute details in the study that were barely discussed, all about memorization, they sum up the fundamental issue with Ec50: it’s all about busy work.Be ready to torture yourself with infuriating projects and copying rows and rows of code, watching boring videos from Gregory bruich, and writing an infuriatingly long paper while preparing for what will probably be another exam all about whether you remember the shape of a random graph from 3 months ago.",-0.8927,"I would totally recommend this course.

I took the course concurrently with two other hard classes and it was doable, but again, don't count on it being a complete gem.

But the flaws?Where to begin?First of all, this isn’t Ec10. Chetty is not at all available in the way Furman and Laibson are, who offer regular office hours and lunches. OH is appointment only and rare lunches are lotteried. The structure makes little sense. Is this course about coding or understanding the studies and social issues in America? As someone wrote on last year’s Q, this course tries to do both and ends up doing neither.The psets do zero and are just everyone scrambling to copy and get answers from one another or teaching staff. There’s just little explicit connection between what we do in lecture and the work itself, which is tedious and teaches little.Oh, and the exams are torturous: asking about minute details in the study that were barely discussed, all about memorization, they sum up the fundamental issue with Ec50: it’s all about busy work.Be ready to torture yourself with infuriating projects and copying rows and rows of code, watching boring videos from Gregory bruich, and writing an infuriatingly long paper while preparing for what will probably be another exam all about whether you remember the shape of a random graph from 3 months ago.",-0.8927,"I would totally recommend this course. I took it as my econ writing elective, but I'm telling my friends who aren't ec concentrators that they should take it now too! I admit I thought the title ""Big Data"" sounded pretty boring, and even in the first couple lectures I thought it might be dull, but I encourage you to stick it out! The content is SO interesting and pretty much all of it connects back to Harvard and the students here. I will admit that it wasn't a total gem because you need to study for the midterm and final and write an empirical paper, but there are so many support resources in this course that studying for the exams was super doable, and writing the paper wasn't bad because you get to choose a topic that is of personal interest to you.  I took the course concurrently with two other hard classes and it was doable, but again, don't count on it being a complete gem. I fell into the trap of not going to lecture for the first half of the semester, so I ended up watching like 12 lectures over spring break, so just try to be more diligent than I was! There's a weekly lab if you get a chill TF they'll give you time to complete the lab assignments during lab. Overall, this was a great combo of having a relatively light course and also feeling like I learned really important stuff.",0.9951

Instead of standard ABCD options, you'll get ABCDE and options D and E are things like A and B are true or B and C are true.

We gave her statistics proving the contrary and she still had reservations. –  Prof. Gaab gave us feedback that our group slides were not visually accessible to the blind, but we literally had a blind person in our group (not that one person represents everyone in a group but you know that feels a little weird)– My classmate that proudly identifies as Autistic was frequently targeted and antagonized in group discussions not only by the teaching staff asking fairly combative questions, but also by other people in the class who seemed to have a lot of expertise but simply disagreed with their research.",-0.7318,,0.0

The school visit assignment, in my perspective, was one of the best educational experiences I've had at Harvard or prior.

Prof. Pia's enthusiasm for the material is infectious, and she and head TF Alex were so great to work with and knowledgeable about the material. The small class size means that it was really easy to get familiar with everyone, and Pia really encouraged open discussions and exploration. Class is 2x a week, no additional lab or discussion sections. The workload was practically nonexistent outside of class other than a few short readings, a short midterm project, and the final project (which is when you might really have to invest time into the class / come to the lab during non–class hours, based on what question you want to study). I ended up doing a solo project while most people worked in groups, which Pia and Alex were super supportive of, and helped me with planning the components and making sure that they were feasible to complete within the allotted timeframe. They absolutely encouraged students to dig into what interested them. The classes were also filled with lots of delicious fermentation experiments, many of which are very reproducible at home! but maybe not in a student dorm lol. The field trips to breweries, labs, etc. were also super interesting! I was also thesising during the semester, and this was an absolutely great class to balance with that workload and other more time–consuming stem classes.

Instead, I found a such a bureaucratic class that focused so much on procedure and busy work at the expense of actually being a worthy learning experience for a Harvard class slot. Most people who review this course will probably feel neutral to positive about it if, but from what I saw, your experience is largely a function of what team you’re on and who your PL’s are. I enjoyed my PL’s as people, but when it came to what I think they could have done, I feel like there was a lot of missed opportunity. Regarding course structure, I really do think that it was not very effective nor well thought out. My experience was full of going back and forth between stakeholders and not having the freedom nor given the resources to effectively take ownership. There is more of a focus on timeliness and sinking effort into making things look good rather than actually learning useful material.  And right now, there are also questions regarding how much some of the communities we serve actually need us, something that is quite troubling and demotivating when the whole purpose of the course is teaching by creating impact.It’s a fine course, I just feel that it could have been so much more academically/work wise. I think there’s an excellent community in EWB facilitated by the one and only BELLA (as well as Aiden and the others who make the class less boring)!! and I really enjoyed the times I was able to tap into it. Lombardo is chill and I think a cool guy overall, definitely talk to him and get to know him. EWB is a great concept and pretty awesome when looking over the long term, I just think its implementation on the day–to–day needs some work, and I am giving this feedback because I want to see the class improve and anyone coming it to know what my perspective on it was on. It is just one of a variety of experiences, you will likely have a much different one depending on what project/team/PL you have :)",0.9964,"There is a great mission behind the work, but it can be hard to keep sight of that because the work doesn't always feel like it is propelling the mission.

Even more, there are no practice exams for any of the midterms or exams.

The class had a policy where if an assignment is expected to take 120 minutes, then you were expected to not go over that limit too much. You could turn in your potentially partially finished assignment and get full credit. The main thing was to put in effort. I personally felt way better about this class because of that and it made me work to understand the material better than to chase homework completion since completion wasn't the target, honest hard work was. The class is HEAVILY group based, so you must either join the class with a group of friends or make friends in the class to group up with. So, be prepared for that. You group can make or break your midterm and final projects. Most likely, you won't be able to change your project group after the midterm project since the class is so small and the other groups will be pretty calcified by then. So expect to do both projects with the same people. Learn each others' strengths, weaknesses, and schedules for the best cooperation. I had absolutely no time to prepare for the final project presentation, BUT my teammates pulled through hard. Then, when they had their exams, I was the one who had nothing to do and I tried to carry the team then. Play to your strengths and schedules! The pre–session assignments and readings are CRITICAL for being able to implement the midterm and final projects, so you should be VERY FAMILIAR with those and don't half ass it. This is where the leniancy of the class comes back to bite you. I still don't know Backprojection and 3D point mapping well and that meant that in the final project, I was useless for part of it. This should not be you. Learn it well. This class is extremely applied in terms of linear algebra. Know transposition, inversion and its properties, Singular value decomposition, matrix equations as linear system of equations etc. Beyond that, I would argue you should have an INTUITIVE understanding of what effect a matrix has in terms of its effect on a vector. Perhaps the 3Blue1Brown Linear algebra series will help. Consider reading up on projective geometry for extra prep. Get familiar with openCV and numpy and you'll thank yourself. Since I had experience with them, the class was made significantly easier. Learn to use chatGPT well since it is allowed and even encouraged in class. Overall, not much to say about the class. It was an easier class compared to Stat 111, CS181, 263. It wasn't a gem per se, but it was certainly not a hard class. It had its moments of being the hardest things on my plate and it had weeks where I just didn't do much for it. All by design of the class I think. A very doable class and a very gentle but firm introduction to computer vision, the less talked about cousin of AI/ML applications. Best of Luck!",0.9979,,0.0,,0.0

This was my third creative fiction course:I'm in my last semester as an undergrad –– this course has been the greatest I've taken in my four years at Harvard, no sensationalism. Claire did an amazing job leading/facilitating discussion. Unlike other creative writing courses I've been in, she generally stepped back and allowed the students to direct conversation on pieces as we saw fit.As a facet of this being an advanced writing class (meaning you must have taken a fiction writing course previously), there was a high level of engagement from the entire class. Discussion flowed naturally without any disingenuous desire to say something just to check off the box of speaking. Everyone was encouraged to submit whatever they saw fit, even if it pushed the boundaries of what we call fiction. Reading everyone else's works pushed me to be a more thoughtful writer. I felt encouraged to try my hardest in whatever I wrote. This class felt like a privilege and experience much more than a class.The deep level of engagement –– both as a writer and in the comments given to me –– will surely stick with me for years. It's very difficult to summarize how amazing this course was. If writing is something you want to keep in your life, take this course. The amount of effort you put in compounds into what you get out. I cannot recommend this course more, even compared to other creative writing courses here. The only way you could take this course and feel dissatisfied is if you decline to put time or effort into what you submit.Claire was very forward looking in her approach to teaching this course. Takeaways weren't just with regard to the specific work, but also more general in ideas to how we write as a whole. She also subtly encouraged us to become friends with one another. I've taken writing courses where I left without feeling like I really knew anyone else in the class, but the way this class was structured I feel close to everyone. She created a community of writers out of thin air. If you love fiction writing, this course is out of a dream. Truly, I'm glad I took it so late in college so that I didn't compare everything else to it –– every other course pales in comparison.",0.9931,,0.0,,0.0

Discussion posts in other classes can feel like a slog, but trust me –– Professor Wilson's are thought–provoking, accessible, and quite nice to do. The other assignments were also very creatively designed. The final project was a joy to do –– something I'd be excited to go home and work on –– and it was by far my favorite final this semester. ALSO, for your copy of the tales, GET THE E–BOOK.Being able to search in the text was a lifesaver. Highlighting and annotation were a part of the deal, so there were no disadvantage to not having the paper copy. And I paid $20 less than I would have for the paper copy. Highly recommend.

I had not previously taken any courses in the English department and had little to no prior knowledge of visionaries, though I consider myself an avid bookworm.This course was incredibly educational –– Professor Watson is immensely knowledgeable about the topics this course covers; I often felt as though I was given access to a treasure trove by being able to listen to him lecture. As much as students wanted to talk, he would let them talk, but it also seemed as though he had endless insightful comments to add to whatever conversation we were having. Much of the information he lectured to us at the beginning of class before discussion was very difficult to find online, meaning I was able to get so much more out of reading the works in his class than I would have reading them on my own.With that being said, I did sometimes have to put in a lot of extra effort to keep up with the discussion in class, primarily due to most of the class being significantly more familiar with the materials (either having read their works before, or having vast knowledge of the contexts around visionary writings). This wasn't a bad thing –– particularly if you do have prior knowledge since the conversation was very engaged and occurred at a relatively high level –– but, if you're someone like me who had little prior knowledge of the materials before enrolling, I would find time to talk to Professor Watson beforehand –– he is very down–to–earth and helpful, which made the readings and gap in understanding between myself and some of my peers much more manageable. Past just the course material, he helped me strengthen my writing in general and cared about his students at an individual level.

At a time when Taylor Swift is a HUGE topic of conversation (and Harvard is always considered to be pretty newsworthy), there is so much more that could have been done. Honestly, I think a lot of people only stayed in the class with the hope that Taylor would one day show up, but we didn't even get so much as Jack Antonoff. Sometimes we did get incredibly interesting guest speakers (one of my favorites was the costume designer that came during the last month or so), but these speakers were often only left with a rushed 15 minutes or so at the end of class. I think the general class consensus would have been that we would rather these speakers get most or all of the time when they came rather than the regular lectures that we sat through all the time. Sometimes the lecture topics were quite interesting, but most of the time, they were a lot to sit through. I think this class would have been better as less of the typical time spent listening to the professor lecturing and with far more time spent listening to experts from various backgrounds. The little bit of time we did get to spend listening to experts (like guest speakers and some of the very talented TFs) was definitely the most impactful use of our time, so I would have loved to see more of that. A Harvard course on Taylor Swift could have made so much more of a wide–scale statement on the impact of powerful women and the genius of Taylor Swift, but I think the professor's insistence on sticking directly within a certain ""comfort zone"" or running the course like a typical English course limited this opportunity significantly.",0.9956,"Lectures are HORRIBLE.

I personally am a joint CS and Math concentrator (but am doing an English secondary), so I feel that I can “see both sides of the veil,” if that makes sense. I have a few diffuse thoughts. First, the reading list in this class is absolutely excellent. You read a good dose of the “classics” (like Woolf, Orwell, and Montaigne), a good dose of “modern picks” (like Jia Tolentino, Zadie Smith, and some of Prof Wood’s friends that happen to be able to visit class), as well as one book that has rocketed into my all–time favorites (The Periodic Table by Primo Levi). Second, Prof Wood is really quite an amazing lecturer. He has built a career doing “literary deconstructionism,” and so it’s a treat listening to him break open a piece. I do think the lectures near the end of term fall off, however; he has less to say about some of the packets of modern essays. Finally, a word on this class’s difficulty. It really isn’t a huge time sink, and you can skate by if you want to without doing much reading. However, the beauty of English 185 is that the readings are actually manageable—so you will get so much more intellectual richness out of this class IF YOU READ! Also, the workload outside of reading is fairly light; it’s just 2 essays. However, these are supposed to be good pieces (by the standards of an English concentrator, not by the standards of your gen–ed TF)—and that is a nontrivial task.",0.992,,0.0,,0.0

This is not the style of William through whom weekly assignments are submitted. Professor Gates expressed grace and flexibility in class regarding the occasional delay in weekly responses, yet this was not shared by William who had a seemingly unprovoked outburst one week disproportionate to the offense when an outside commitment meant I was a day late in a response submission. Having never received a prior warning from him before (or any email response from him for that matter) I was taken aback by the tone in which he felt comfortable to speak to a student. It was the sort of exchange that would make me want to drop out of a class had I not been so far along in it, which is sad as prior to the interaction it was my most enjoyable course. Having been a TF myself, I was extremely concerned that any student be spoken to in this manner (as was the director of student support who I showed the email to in order to get advice as to how to handle it, I am writing this at her recommendation). I would like to give the benefit of the doubt as we all have off–weeks, however a few other students and auditors shared similarly uncomfortable exchanges with him which made me want to convey this on the evaluation form in the hope that it might be remedied for future students. This is my only criticism for an otherwise fantastic course.",0.984,Be ready to challenge how you read! The intertextuality of the class means that no piece of literature stands alone.

I learned so much in a class setting where I felt comfortable with the professor, able to ask any questions I had, and with a support system to help me succeed. The HW's are doable with or without office hours (although they're definitely easier if you go to office hours), and follow lecture and section very closely. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the topic, but also just anyone wanting to engage with material focused on the causes of global warming.",0.9693,,0.0,,0.0

I felt connected to my whole class by the end of the semester and honestly miss it—we definitely had inside jokes, but also really good conversations. I think that Dr. B works to make sure everyone feels heard in the class, which can lead to some precocious people dominating the conversation unfortunately, but especially if you are on the quieter side, I encourage you to speak up as much as you can. I definitely don't think that this is an easy A Expos—Dr. B is very knowledgable, in a way that definitely makes her picky about argumentation and structure. Still, I really think I learned a lot from this class. The material is really interesting and our readings covered a range of fields (social science, medicine, psychology, etc) which was cool. I think students who were already good at writing definitely thrived in this class, while as someone with a relatively untraditional background, I struggled a bit, so I cannot recommend starting EARLY and going to Dr. B with questions enough. She is very supportive and helpful, but deadlines creep up fast. Still, assignment prompts are pretty flexible and I really felt like Dr. B cared about each of us developing as a writer.

First, keep in mind that discussions on this topic were very contemporary as protests were literally happening while we were taking the class. Setting that aside, I really really really struggled to find a heterogenous flow of thought in the discussions themselves. It often seemed like everybody was in this bubble where anything other than what they thought would be seen as awfully implausible. This contributed to an overall homogenous discussion (as literally everybody agreed with each other), but I feel like it took away from the educational purpose of the seminar itself. It is unfortunate, but of course it doesn’t take away from the learning aspect of the class. It very much felt like an history class where debates were not really an option, which did help me learn a lot about activism at Harvard and beyond, but didn’t help me develop a stream of thought on why I could change my view.

The content is really interesting if you're into feminism, and the course reviews a wide but also balanced variety of materials (short stories, theory, social media) that gives you a very holistic and well–informed view of feminism. The course probably improves your writing just like any other Expos class would, but I think what's especially nice about this class compared to other Expos classes (at least according to what I heard from my friends also taking Expos) is that Dr. Gold is really good at giving constructive feedback and advice that's very fitting to your questions. In that vein, she's also very accessible in terms of draft conferences and office hours. Her feedback allowed me to get past the early obstacles in my essay writing, which makes the essay writing process a lot easier overall – you can spend more time developing your arguments and mapping out your structure, rather than getting stuck on, say, formulating your thesis. Also, Dr. Gold is super lenient with deadlines – if something is due on Monday at 12am, it's actually due before she wakes up on Tuesday morning, so if you're a night owl, this is really helpful! That being said, I think you could also say that writing essays in this class is a little ""easier"" than in some other classes if you're interested in the topic. Theses are pretty easy to formulate since you're probably well–acquainted with a selection of feminism–related sources and pop culture, so essays can grow from your natural line of reasoning, whereas in more ""obscure"" Expos topics, it might be harder to do that, meaning you might spend more time on your essays. But also take this paragraph with a grain of salt, lol, just something I observed.",0.9953,,0.0,,0.0

Each class period was either spent watching half of a film that we were to be writing about (which could have been done outside of class) or dissecting students' work. Most classes were the latter: we would sit and listen as Ms. Strauss analyzed each student's topic sentences or body paragraphs, painfully slowly, in front of the rest of the students. It seemed like our time could have been much better spent on other things, like revising our work or even writing our drafts, but instead we sat and listened to feedback that didn't apply to us and would have been much better as a private suggestion or canvas comment. I wish that we could have spent more time actually learning, eg. going deeper into film techniques or the history and context of the films we were watching, or engaging with more material about the definition of persona and its relevance. Also, the essay prompts were at the same time very vague and very specific, eg. ""you’ll enter into a scholarly conversation about the issue of persona, debating whether living and building relationships via persona leads to the ultimate gain or loss of the self. Is the construct of persona completely deceitful or could there be elements of authenticity and/or integrity that can forge personal growth and true connections with others? Might artificial constructs serve the individual, and, by extension, our greater community in constructive ways?"" In the above prompt, we are constrained to write about persona and its positive/negative impacts on the self. Or maybe on persona's impact on relationships? Or personal growth? Or the community? It was unclear if we were supposed to pick one of these prompts or somehow respond to all of the above questions (and it was implied in–class that we were meant to respond to all of the questions in the thesis alone). Finally, Ms. Strauss's grading often hinged on very strict formatting issues. Our thesis had to be the last sentence of our introduction, our introduction ought only to be one paragraph, etc. I understand that an expository writing course should introduce students to the structure of an analytical essay, but the concern about formatting constrained creativity and I feel that my writing is now more rigid and less tied together than when I began the course.It is HARD to get an A in this class. Ms. Strauss does not grade leniently, and the only assignments are the 3 essays (plus an annotated bibliography and participation points). There are no opportunities to raise your grade outside of the essays and Ms. Strauss will not allow additional help or conferences outside the single 15 minute conference for Essays 1 and 3 (to keep things fair among the students, because she doesn't have time to help everyone–––understandable, but it also aids to general stress around the large assignments). I personally feel that Expository Writing ought to be a safe space to raise your writing skills to college level, not a GPA stressor. And the fact that each class period was sharing your draft with the whole class and having Ms. Strauss critique it publicly led to a vibe of maybe not outright competition but certainly isolation. The class materials (especially the films provided) were very interesting, and I was grateful to watch famous and influential movies that I wouldn't have otherwise seen. But that's the only thing that I felt I got from this class.TLDR; we watch good movies but they are not worth the strict grading policy, BORING class periods, and isolating nature of the curriculum.",0.9894,,0.0,,0.0

The theme of 20 is 'The Successful Life.' For context, I am a student–veteran who did not attend a private school, nor am I a brilliant writer. FGLI and minority status would be used to describe myself. With that said, I am aware that my background has brought me to ideas of what success should look like or what would be nice, but are those ideas what you came to Harvard for? Or did you come to Harvard to train your mind to create change that not only benefits yourself but the greater community as a whole? I got closer to the answers of the above questions. They may never be solved, but the closer you get to solving them, the closer you will get to ""the good life"" (if you take the course, you'll see where that's from).In Unit 1, you will be exposed to various sources to think critically about while furthering your writing skills and vocabulary. This unit was beneficial. In my free time, I would think about how the sources could relate to my path and what I could learn from them to make the most of my time at Harvard. Throughout Unit 2, you will see another type of writing: research. You will bring several ideas from Unit 1 and add to this arsenal with more sources that connected with me and other students from similar backgrounds. It was a humbling experience to realize that many other students have experienced and are going through exactly what you may be. You will have a library session (this also occurs in regular 20) to learn how to conduct academic research, which was super helpful (shout out to Susan (Sue) Gilroy, librarian – she is the best and sweetest!). I did not realize how complex finding sources can be. You have a heavy dose of freedom to choose what you want to research with a few restrictions. You can then use many of the skills you've been training to sort through evidence and ideas to come to a conclusion that informs and educates your audience. I found this very helpful and relevant to what you may be exposed to here at Harvard. Take this course if you want to think deeply about your future and what you care about most. Professor Taleen Mardirossian has made a math concentrator love writing and sees value in what it offers to the world. She takes the time to work with you and your ideas while bringing many of her experiences and knowledge. She goes above and beyond to ensure her students' success and does this in a manner that is indicative of what a Harvard professor should be. Taleen created a safe environment for ideas and thoughts while being courteous to others. Often, I would even find myself laughing while learning. She makes this course what it is, and the writing department should hold onto her. I greatly respect Professor Mardirossian and would like to endorse her in all of her future endeavors at Harvard and beyond. Please take this course to learn from a legend! She should be the head of the writing department.",0.9986,,0.0,,0.0

Also, if you're taking Physics 143A, the second half of 143 is basically covered in the first 4 lectures of the seminar, which is pretty helpful.",0.9855,,0.0,,0.0

Even if you are not a Folk&Myth concentrator (like me), this can be a wonderful way to get out of your comfort zone and try something new (or to fulfill your Divisional Distribution requirement).Pros:– Interesting content from which you learn a lot. I was interested in folklore before taking the class, but to me, this just meant folk songs and dances. This class delves much deeper into the field of ethnography and you get a totally new understanding of folklore through this prism. I feel I really learned a lot about the world in this class– Engaging class discussions. Be sure to do the readings so that you can meaningfully engage in the discussions (or at least understand what is being talked about). This class is rather discussion–based (not really a lecture style) so you really need to do the readings to learn and have a fun experience– Assignments are very fun to do and make you get out of your comfort zone. I had so much fun taking field notes and engaging with different places in Cambridge, events, and folk groups. I had a lot of fun attending a performance and engaging with my chosen folk group. I am really glad this class pushed me to have all those experiences – Deadlines are flexible. This saved me on many occasions. Sarah is very understanding and really tries to make the class as low–stress as possible– SARAH IS WONDERFUL!!! She put a lot of effort into the class and made it very interesting and engaging. She also has a lot of experience and is very knowledgeable on the subject. I was so interested whenever she entered a more lecture–like mode and shared her experiences and thoughts!Cons:– The has a heavy workload. There is a lot of reading and an assignment to do each week. These are all fun and interesting, but still, it takes a significant amount of time (perhaps especially if you are more of a STEM than a humanities person). However, I felt that all the work was insightful and needed. This is just a warning if anyone is looking for an easy elective.

It will be a waste of your time because the material is not novel or cutting–edge any longer. The material clearly has not been updated in a decade (despite the professor's assertion of its groundbreaking nature) and the course's central thesis (which she repeats every lecture) is totally surface–level and elementary. The only thing that kept me there were the two requirements that it filled (GenEd and concentration). There was an instance in lecture in which a student asked a question and Professor Lewis said that she would provide an ""undergraduate answer"" to the question, implying that we wouldn't be able to grasp the complexities of the fuller answer. There was another instance in which a student began commenting on more recent events as they pertained to that day's lecture material, and the professor cut her off, saying that she would ""get there next week"" and did not want her to continue so as to ""spoil"" the lecture. You cannot ""spoil"" of American history and culture. She provides no flexibility or opportunity for true commentary and dissent; calling on the same students who affirm your viewpoints does not create a fruitful learning environment. I am not a student with a marginalized political viewpoint in the slightest at Harvard, but the homogeneity of perspective and professorial reverence that happened in this classroom was nauseating and completely unprecedented. The fact that she is going to transform this into a seminar course is terrifying; section was this course's saving grace, and with that removed, all of the problems with the course's current iteration will be amplified.

I have no religious affiliation at all, and I found the course instruction to be incredibly even–handed, fair, and interesting to learn. Not only were the history lessons themselves actually cool and fascinating, Holland also does an incredible job in including and fleshing out overlooked histories of religion in American life, such as the Nation of Islam, queer hermeneutics, and many other niche topics you'd likely miss out on in a generic American history of religion course taught elsewhere. Also, Prof. Holland is a master of the English language; it's crazy how he answers student questions with such beautiful yet concise responses. He speaks exactly how a great author writes, and it blows my mind how he can come up with that language on the spot.

It uses the study of mythology to explore disturbing themes such as parricide, cannibalism, incest, misogyny, and adultery, as well as to understand the cultures and connections in the Mediterranean world in the centuries before and after the Common Era. The mythographic tools used in this course are tied to a variety of fields including history, psychology, philosophy, etymology, and anthropology. You will also learn to identify Classical gods and myths in pottery and sculptures!Professor: Rachel is an enthusiastic and engaging professor. She discusses touchy themes in a light–hearted yet considerate manner. She is great at breaking down myths in more modern gen z/millennial vocabulary while still retaining depth and formality.

Overall, the TF teaching staff and content in the class exceeded my expectations, but I am still disappointed by Professor Patterson's approach to the class. Aside from the days where we have guest speakers, the lectures often feel disengaging and I get the sense that this course is somewhat of a historical artifact at Harvard, where you are ""talked at"" in lectures and hit with outdated ideas. The terms and language used by Professor Patterson (eg. ""backwards countries"" to describe North Korea and India, along with his claim that Japanese internment did not constitute the definition of ""forced labor"") is, at best, a dismissive claim that makes me feel less confident about his teachings, and at worst, an offensive microaggression that made me feel unsafe and angry with the course. I actually stopped going to lectures after the third class when that happened, and did not return until Professor Patterson mandated attendance, because I just did not feel welcome in such a lecture environment. Perhaps I had an inflated expectation of Professor Patterson too –– for someone who has coined influential terms about slavery as ""social death"", I did not expect him to be careless in his language and application of terminology in what feels like a racialized way (primarily dismissing Asian examples of forced labor, such as the Chinese coolie trade and Japanese internment, as ""less bad"" in definitional terms). I think this course has (or had) a lot of potential, but it is due for an overhaul and updating to be accountable to more critical views of racism, colonialism, and structural violence.",-0.9927,"This is definitely a gem.

First of all, they expect you to buy like 10 books (and they have a strong preference for hard copy, not digital) that you read like a few chapters from and then never touch again. So be ready to spend a few hundred dollars if you want to be in the teaching staff's good graces.Lectures could often be hard to pay attention to/frustrating because he was literally reading off of a script. The workload for this class is completely insane for a gened. They expect you to do over a hundred (often hundreds) of pages of reading per week, with notes that you have to submit to your tf every week answering questions about the source. I often had just as much, if not more reading in this class than either my gov class or history class that I took this semester, which should absolutely not be the case FOR A GENED. The worst part, though, was how unnecessarily strict the grading was. I truly have no idea why the TFs felt the need to be so tough, but it was completely ridiculous. Apparently I am able to write 10+ page history and government essays that can get high A's, but that ability for some mysterious reason vanishes when I cross into the hellscape that is the gened program. Also, the feedback they give you is not particularly helpful. For example, on the essay portion of the midterm I received a few inline comments with a ""Great work!"" at the end, followed by a 17/20. Like what? Either give me areas where I screwed up on (and thus did not produce ""great work"") or give me a grade that reflects ""great work."" This class is literally Exhibit A of why Harvard NEEDS to abolish the gened program.

On the one hand, the course staff is incredible. Professor Harris is thoughtful, in–touch with student experiences, and entertaining in lecture. My TF was also very on–top of things, responsive, and helpful in section. The material is absolutely fascinating. You cover readings from literally centuries ago up to the present, yet everything you read feels relevant and personal. The discussions in section with students were eye–opening and inspiring.At the same time, although this was my first GenEd, I still don't think it is anything like other GenEd classes. This class has only been a GenEd for a few years, so I think the difficulty is a remnant of when it was a small, department class, not a GenEd with over a hundred students. The course design was very thoroughly thought–out, which I appreciated, yet I found the design incredibly frustrating. If you want to fully participate in the course, it requires hours of reading (often ~100 pages per class) and at least half an hour of video lectures before ever stepping into the classroom. The in–person lectures were primarily answering student questions. I personally struggled with the flipped–classroom style––I'm way more likely to learn something when I'm sitting in a class than when I'm trying to watch a video in my free time. Many students hardly ever showed up to the in–person lectures. Additionally, the essays (which are the main assignments in the course) were anonymously graded––fair in theory, but it meant I got minimal feedback and wasn't able to talk to the person who had actually read my essay.A few things I wish I could tell my past self: –   Take the class pass–fail. You will be able to enjoy the content without stressing over B's on the essays. I understand that a B is a respectable grade, but I gave real effort on my writing and just didn't have the bandwidth to spend more time on this course. I gave these essays more energy than I ever did for an expos essay, for example, and still got worse grades than I have in any other course. I'm frustrated that this GenEd will likely bring down my GPA. I know that's not what's important here, but I still care about it and I'm guessing you do too. –   This course is better if you have prior philosophy experience. There is very little guidance or support if you are new to reading philosophy––and believe me, it is hard to do for the first time. Similarly, there is very little support for actually crafting an argument for your essays (the course staff basically refused to give examples of what a thesis might sound like or how a student might construct a philosophical argument). My TF and Professor Harris were happy to give feedback on my drafts (and very kind to do so), but I felt alone in figuring out where to begin. The essays also require you to think in a way that isn't really addressed in the course itself. The lectures, videos, and sections are focused on understanding the views of one philosopher at a time, and almost no time is spend discussing critiques or shortcomings of a philosopher. Then, the essays ask you to find flaws and compare different philosophers, which I found very challenging and new.  –   Be honest with yourself about the impact of this material on you personally. I think a lot of students are interested in this course because they are themselves religious or because they have left religion and want to think deeply about it. I know this sounds kind of silly, but I came into this course hoping it would be valuable during a very unstable spiritual period of my life, and it put me through the wringer emotionally. I left more existential than I came in, and although I thought I wanted that, it was so overwhelming and debilitating at times. I don't think this course would help someone figure out what they do or don't believe. On the last day of class, Professor Harris' send–off was simply ""I hope you leave feeling confused."" So. Take that as you will.I know I've been pretty harsh here, and I'm sorry for the essay. I think this course has so much potential, and for many of the philosophy–minded students, I'm sure it was a very positive experience. Professor Harris has so much wisdom to share, it's a great way to read a lot of philosophy if you've been looking for an excuse, and you'll meet a lot of awesome students with really interesting perspectives on religion and morally. You'll have fascinating discussions in sections and learn a lot of different, valid ways of approaching similar moral challenges. That said, I cried SO MUCH over this course and I'm not sure the perspective I gained was worth having my GenEd be the most energetically–demanding class in my semester.",0.9988,"Please do not take this class just because you want a ""rigorous gened from which you will actually learn something."" Only take it if you're sure that you're interested in theism – not religious history, theology, philosophy, or anything else. It must be theism. Take science of cooking or some other gened that'll teach you useful information.I strongly regret not taking this class pass/fail. This class has given me the most amount of stress this semester, and my semester q–guide median total was over 50 hours. I take hard schedules, and this was the class that sent me over the edge a few times.If you have the time to dedicate several hours to reading and chewing on the material, this would be a good class. To be honest, you're better of doing the readings on your own. Sections were fun because my TF was nice, but they were mostly dead. The lectures were a waste of time. Professor Harris spent most of the first few lectures discussing the morality of incest. ""If we ignore genetic issues, why is incest bad? If we ignore family–structure–in–society issues, why is it bad? If we <remove every good argument for incest that is sufficient for all who are not weebs>, why is it bad? Why do you feel disgruntled? Huzzah! Morals are not objective."" ""Ignoring sanitary issues, why is eating feces bad?"" He also grossly simplifies/generalizes to the point of being really wrong about some details. I stopped going to lectures after the fourth week, and that was the best decision I've made regarding this class. The only better decisions I could've made would be to not to go to any lecture or BETTER YET to not take this class.Do the moral thing by practicing self–love (Hume). Don't take this class. This class has made me doubt if there's a God because of how frustrating this class was. I felt worse than Job because he at least was rewarded for suffering through all his troubles. I on the other hand? I got nothing coming out of this besides a strong dislike of theism, philosophers, and ""but... but what if?"" type of questions. If there is no God, then all is indeed permitted because this class was allowed to be unleashed on us poor undergrads.I'm being a bit extreme, but in all seriousness, unless you really really like the content, and you have come to that conclusion by going through many of the course readings, don't take this class. Do yourself a favor. I'll buy you a cookie if you don't take this class (and if you figure out who I am somehow??).",-0.9622,,0.0

It will certainly challenges your preconceptions about schooling, and as long as you are willing to come in with an open mind, you can take a lot away while engaging in friendly debate. The teaching team and assignments were certainly the highlight of this course for me. The TFs were incredibly passionate about their work and receptive to student feedback, which made my time in the course so much more enjoyable. Pennie in particular was absolutely phenomenal, and someone who made learning an absolute blast. Her emphasis on each student's well–being was truly unmatched. I also don't think this course could have picked a better array of assignments––a reflective essay on our K–12 journeys, a teacher interview, and a final project on a topic of choice––which gave me a lot of agency. The class is quite large at around 100 students, and while that leaves a lot of room to learn from your peers, it also makes for whole–group discussions that sometimes feel unproductive. Note that this is a nearly three–hour course, but it meets once a week, and––for better or worse––the time is not made up entirely of lectures.

This class in many ways reminded me of being in 2nd grade again. Every email starts with ~Dear Wonderers~. The homeworks were basically fill in the blanks, they were fully completion–based, and there were only 5 of them. Besides that, there's only a final project worth like 10%. And, on top of this, there's extra credit available too! The once a week lectures were an interesting walk through many disparate topics in science. This class would have ran wonderfully if people actually cared about the material and paid attention. But, it's a gened after all, and if people aren't held accountable for knowing the material for homeworks or exams, no one pays attention. This is my critique of the whole gened system (that no one ever cares about actually learning in them, just doing the minimal amount of work). I think this class has so much potential, if taught to an enthusiastic set of students, to be a place for so much creativity and learning.

I thought the content was interesting, the lectures were engaging, and the section component was great. I definitely think about IR in a different light now. Here's a list of pros and cons for the course.PROS:Chaudoin is extremely engaging as a lecturer and super passionate about the material.The material straight up is not difficult. There's an entire section of a lesson dedicated to reading a regression table and determining whether the result was statistically significant. Other lessons are about basic game theory (stag hunt, PD), the bargaining model of war, etc. The tests were not super difficult. The averages were always around 90. Each test question / assignment is graded by the same TF, so grades are usually pretty fair. Katie is awesome. So friendly, responsive, and passionate about the material. Seriously made this class 100x better. CONS:The assignments did seem to be graded kind of harshly (but feedback was pretty good). Chaudoin sort of has a high school teacher mentality sometimes where he calls people out for not paying attention in lecture or not doing the readings. While I understand this must be frustrating as a professor, this is college and I sort of assume that lecture time is my choice to do with as I want (as long as I don't disrupt others). I then suffer the consequences of not paying attention. Chaudoin would often call people out and embarrass them for not paying attention to lecture, which I thought was unnecessary and uncomfortable. For reference, I never was one of the students who were put on the hot seat for this. The cutoff for an A this year was quite harsh at 95% (although nobody got below a B–, and most got either A's or A–'s). The Pick a War Assignment. You'd think group projects would be better at Harvard. Nope.Overall, great teaching staff, great content, great class. I'd definitely take it if you're a Gov concentrator.",0.9953,The course examines some interesting events and topics through the lens of different models. It's really about applying economic and other models to international relations events. It isn't really about learning about international relations as much as applying these models.

I learned a lot about quantitative methods to apply to social science questions, and the difficult material was made very digestible. Don't get me wrong, the material was challenging and complex, but I found the class super interesting. This class actually made me reconsider what I wanted to study because I loved the topics/possibilities in this area. Naijia, Jeremiah, and the course assistants were beyond helpful and dedicated to making sure you have the tools to understanding the concepts and succeed. The course staff definitely made the class great. The problem sets were difficult for me, but I was able to complete them by going to office hours and collaborating with peers. One thing to note is that the distribution of work is not very consistent: some weeks I would do 0 work and other weeks (like when we had a problem set, exam, or project) I would do many hours of work. However, the work is very manageable *especially if you go to office hours*. I also found the final project very interesting, though it was a bit difficult to apply what we learned. Although I don't feel like I have a super strong grasp of R, exposure to coding in R will surely be beneficial if I ever need to use statistical coding again (which I likely will because this class helped me realize that I want to pursue more quantitative social science or related field).

This course forced me to regularly think about my thesis and also helped me understand how to apply for grant funding and obtain IRB approval. That said, this course was one of the worst I have taken at Harvard. The assignments were poorly organized, essentially busywork, and graded on such a massive delay as to be essentially unhelpful in their feedback most of the time. For example, the reading response assignments were about application readings that were almost all about eastern europe (not even close to my area of gov) so it felt difficult and unhelpful for me to write all of the critiques about these papers. The first paper I wrote during one of the first weeks of the class still hadn't been graded as of reading period, so I wasn't able to implement feedback from it in order to improve later papers. Regarding the project papers, the guidelines were so incredibly vague that the assignments became extremely frustrating. And the fact that they weren't graded cummulatively meant that myself and many of my classmates were constantly instructed to repeat ourselves in these papers and a lot of the feedback I got was asking for information that I had included in previous papers but had not had the word count to repeat in the following papers. It was unclear what the TFs and professors would be looking for in these papers and I was often given conflicting information from TFs and professors as to what they wanted me to prioritize. At some points they even disagreed quite vehemently about the feedback I was eventually given. The actual class time was also pretty unhelpful. It felt like we just repeatedly did the same TF–led activities week after week (building research plans for topics or questions) but at least myself and my table group entered the class at the beginning of the semester already having a strong grasp of how to do this so I don't feel that we gained much from it and we had more and more trouble buying into the activities as the semester went on. It just felt like a weekly waste of time. The most helpful moments of the class were when we would get into discussions that were essentially just Q&A sessions for advice on how to best implement a specific method, but these discussions were often cut off by the professor in order to ""get us back on track"" to the activities the TFs had planned that were not particularly helpful. In general, the whole class just felt very disorganized and like it had too many useless assignments. I'm not sure exactly what the solution is, but the class needs to be restructured somehow. Perhaps moving the lecture back to be during the actual class period would be a start, as it did not seem like ""flipping"" the class was worth it for the activities we did during the class period. It would have been much nicer to have the chance to ask advice style questions about each method and the ability to ask questions during the lecture.",0.9695,Gov 62 is a must if you’re planning to write a thesis in government.

As a result, lectures had to accommodate a wide range of experience levels, which often meant that no one learned anything at all.In the end, I have a slightly better understanding of webcrawling/webscraping than I did when I entered the course, but I believe that I could have learned much of this content online.

The first weeks are spent learning theory about how and why organizations function. Specifically, students examine Weberian theories of bureaucracy, theories of organizations which stress bounded rationality (i.e. behavioral), among others. The next weeks of the course are spent on the military. This is an administrative history of the army since the early 1900s, so if you're interested in learning about the laws which have constructed the modern military, this will be fruitful for you. The class is heavily weighted toward this module, and is full of ROTC kids and students interested in the military. Prof. Carpenter also invites several guest lecturers who are informative and engaging. The next weeks of the course focus on the FDA, using Carpenter's 700 page book as its reading and starting point for discussion. Like the army, this is an administrative history—so, while dry—it's interesting to see how the actual sausage gets made in terms of regulations and rulemaking. The course concludes with a survey of the Federal Reserve and financial regulation. My one qualm was with the section component of the class. Angelo, the TF, is clearly really smart, but does not manage section time well, and often rushes to cram half the content into the last three minutes of section. Moreover, the prompts were terribly designed (unclear if this is an Angelo or a Prof. Carpenter problem), and the expectations for essays felt terribly communicated. To quote one senior: ""the essays in this class were more complicated than my thesis."" Despite my qualms about the papers, this course is interesting not only for the administrative history and organizational theory, but also for the tidbits of history you learn along the way; lectures sometimes digress into discussions of the finer points of the 2008 financial crisis or Operation Desert Storm. Prof. Carpenter is a wonderful lecturer and I feel like I left this course with a great amount of information not only about bureaucracy but also about how the world in general works. I would recommend for those who care about figuring out how the government actually works.",0.9653,"Although I loved the lecture portion of this course, the section was entirely unhelpful and the assignments made no sense. Not only were the paper prompts unclear and confusing, but the TF's grading system made absolutely no sense and left a lot to be desired.

I learned from the readings, but I struggled to learn in lecture. We did class activities almost every lecture (which was about 80 people). During these activities the directions were usually pretty unclear and we would waste about 20 minutes of lecture trying to do the activity. The lectures were never really coherent and did not always connect to the rest of course material, in my opinion. As for the section component, it was not bad but none of the TF's were on the same page. I don't think that was the TF's fault, but people in other sections were learning material that was very different from what was covered in my section. Lastly, the assignments were a bit arbitrary. There are three big ones throughout the semester, and students were either given very concrete and direct instructions to follow, or very flimsy guidelines. For example, our final project (worth 25% of our grade) was a paper with no page minimum or maximum, and extremely vague guidelines of what information should be included. Overall, I was unsatisfied with the class that had so much potential to be really interesting and engaging.",-0.6626,"You can basically choose how much you want to engage with this course. However, if you want to get a good grade in the class, you need to TRY on the written assignments! Do not take the policy memo/other assignments lightly – they're graded pretty harshly year to year! As someone who did very well on all 3, I'd heavily recommend asking your TF PLENTY of questions on what they're specifically looking for (Ansolabehere definitely doesn't make it clear – you need to dig for soft requirements). Other than that, Ansolabehere is a gem and the class simulations are super fun. Just be wary and don't take the class too lightly.",0.9694

She's very passionate about sharing everything she knows. The TAs were all very kind, patient, and helpful as well. The level of detailed feedback we would get on our papers from our assigned TA was ridiculous, I think nearly every sentence had feedback and this is even if you got a solid grade on the paper.

I was able to produce primary sources that will help in my future research, and I am so inspired by the power of oral history to fill the scholarly gaps which exist in history and many other humanities disciplines. By centering working–class, Indigenous, and marginalized communities, I have learned so much about how to be a good oral historian and how to be critical and reflective of my own work. This course was abundant and is the start of a long journey. All thanks to Professor Holmes who is one of the best historians I have ever met.

The theme: unclear, unfair, and changing expectations. I am a STEM concentrator who took this course as an elective and had the following issues with it: the expectations were unclear, the teaching style was all lecture, it was not an intro level course in some respects but too much in others, and the assignments were both too much and unclear in expectation. I love art and Italian culture, but this course lost all of the wonder. Yes, you can work hard and probably do well. But in the last few days of the course (during reading period) they told us it would be curved down and that only a few As would be given out. Had I know this, I would NOT have taken this course. I know it is not good to only want an A, but as a STEM concentrator I wanted exposure to new topics while having the ability to do well. I know only the HAA concentrators will be able to get As due to this. There were issues like this at every step of the course that must be addressed in order to make it better. Here are the issues:The exams were not clearly laid out until right before they occurred. The final format was only told to us five days before the exam (during reading period!), which was not helpful for preparation or stress levels. The essays also had unclear goals except at the end for the last essay when a rubric was finally provided. Examples of how to write a formal analysis would be great, as the reading was helpful but as someone who studies STEM and had never interacted with any content like this at all was incredibly confusing with expectations. The slide tests were unpredictable in timing and led to a lot more stress and time spent on this course than I think was needed. Setting dates for them would be helpful for learning and reducing stress. The slide tests were said to be given at the start of class but never were. This led to everyone being stressed throughout the class until the last fifteen minutes. This is incredibly unconducive to learning and attention and needs to be addressed. There were many assignments in this course that it felt like too much for an intro class (three essays, two exams, 4 slide tests, many readings that had to be done)The reliance on blank lecture slides and writing down everything said by the professor did not seem like the best way to engage with the works, even though there is a lot of information I wish this class was taught in a small non lecture or less lecture format with use of newer and more effective learning strategies. The TFs provided short comments on the essays that were helpful but I would have loved more feedback as someone who has not written an essay in college in a long time. The feedback on what counts as a ""fact"" on a slide test was also constantly changing and unclear, which was not in line with learning and preparing well for them or the class. This was advertised as an intro course but it did not feel that way. I am a STEM concentrator with little introduction to classical literature and art, important art historians, or religious background. None of these were well explained for a person without the knowledge. Especially with the religious stories, we were expected to know and understand the saints and other things that I did not, making it hard to see the symbols in the works. I think more focus on teaching to a student who has no background would be great, or removing the word intro in the title and making it for HAA concentrators!This course taught me the things I memorized while studying for exams, but I lost a lot of the wonder for the art and the process along the way as a function of the layout of the course.The sunlight is the TFs. They were so nice and tried to make the best of it, but still the course was not great overall.",0.9933,,0.0,,0.0

While obviously this is understandable, Professor Croft offered no grace at all to students! Her disorganization was so ironic considering the harshness of her grading to students' work. Now reflecting on this  course it was extremely poor. For example:  – Readings would go up like 3–4 hours before class with the expectation that students should be well versed in the material. Canvas pages and modules were constantly locked and she would insist that they were not. She would cite that resources were on canvas when they were not. For example, she constantly referred students to a glossary that did not exist on the canvas page until just a few days before final papers were due (this was after she was reminded by a student). – Navigating the canvas page was a hellish maze until a student had suggested Professor Croft organize a bit– Harsh and picky grading, extremely defensive to student feedback– Professor Croft refused to explain what she wanted to see in assignments. She just graded arbitrarily without clearly explaining why she choose to grade the way she did and what exactly her expectations were.– Even though this was not an English course she would take off significantly for minor grammar errors. – She would sent SO many emails that I became overwhelmed (it was more emails that all my other courses for the semester combined) and yet none of these emails actually communicated important aspects of the class material or grading expectations– She would make up her citation system (and extension of Chicago) and asked students to submit an annotated bibliography but said it was not annotated (confusing, right!)– She was not open to office hours and only had a few times to meet. The week of the final paper she didn't hold office hours for the five days leading to the submission deadline.– She pushed off all research questions to the Fine Arts Librarians, who were ALSO confused by her unclear rubric and quantity of emails.– Lectures were wayyy to long.

That was certainly not the case: each week, a professor (one who was literally leading their subfield/region in art history) would come and give us an off–the–record take on their selected objects/concepts, which meant that sometimes we were listening to work they hadn't published yet, and other times we got to hear their reflections on their previous scholarship –– things they agreed with, things they would change. It was super refreshing to step out of my art history comfortzones, if only for a week at a time, and to read across all mediums, time periods, and regions. So take this course for a solid introduction to art history, one that exposes you to the perspectives of the fields from the people who started/advanced/defined them.The only complaint I have about this class is that the level of academic engagement with this opportunity and the materials was highly variable. Out of the 15 students in the class, maybe 4 would be actively engaged in each discussion, and because of this sometimes it felt hard to be part of a larger class community. Of course, this vibe will change with each cohort, so take this comment as you will.Moreover, if (part of) the role of the art historian is to write art in a way that expands how you view it, then Kirsten has done an immaculate job of showing us how to do so. Each week Kirsten would offer us some of the most eloquent, beautiful, and well–connected thoughts on the art concepts we had been introduced to in discussoin. And, I kid you not, I would actively refresh the course Canvas page each weekend for her comments on my response papers to appear, because I knew she would always say something that would make me rethink my takes on a particular art historical concept or extend my visual analysis more incisively into the materiality, historical significance, or tradition of a medium/era. On a personal note, she also sent me extra readings she thought I would find helpful or interesting, and was wholly encouraging of me going into art history in the future. Her accessibility, kindhearted support, and geniality has truly helped me find my footing within this field, and I felt so lucky to have been welcomed into art history through taking this course with her.",0.9917,,0.0,,0.0

Professor Lajer–Burcharth really contributes to the ""buy–in"" of this course, because it is clear that she is fascinated by the topics we were discussing and is genuinely interested in our ideas and perspective of the material. Our weekly discussions were rewarding and fruitful, especially given that we paired our discussions with an in–situ viewing of art from the Museums' collection.

Narrowing down at least a topic of study before the semester will allow you to use class to your full benefit and will, in general, make your experience more chill. Second, be aware that the course is quite chill at the beginning of the semester (think 1–3 hrs per week) and that towards the end of the semester, once you start drafting, the work spikes a lot (think 8ish hours per week once you start drafting, with potentially many more during reading period.

While I think that the discussion–leading is good in theory, I wish that Jasanoff was more involved in asking questions. Often times, the discussion questions were very niche and we didn't make it to discussing all of the readings. For how fascinating they are, I wish the discussions were more grounded in the readings. It might be helpful for the TFs and Jasanoff to lead a discussion in the first or second class for a model of how it should be done and what kinds of questions should be asked. But, often, the discussions felt quite divorced from the readings and it didn't feel productive. Additionally, the feedback in this course is very unclear. All semester, we were getting grades on the basis of a check, check plus, or check minus, which is hard to translate into grades.

I would not take this along with other hard classes and def not as a freshman, I think I really pushed myself too much there and kinda paid the price. Overall, the class is very good and the exams are either you know it or you don’t, no getting around it. You do have to study everyday and continuously memorize or else this classes causes you so much stress pre–exam that you won’t be able to memorize 200+ flashcards before the exams. The professors are incredibly understanding but the lectures are pretty monotonous (even though Jo is extremely energetic) and lots of people just stop going to them because the course really just depends on you memorizing information. I don’t really think there’s any other more engaging way of teaching this because it really just is that. For me, the evolutionary aspect didn’t add anything interesting to the course, I’d look into LS2 before this class because the few physiology parts of this course were more fun than the evolutionary ones. There’s basically no other work outside of class (prob 30min max outside work) so you really should be studying everyday and I didn’t have that discipline so totally on me. Labs were super lowkey and no pressure like LS1a, LS1b or LPSA. Overall, I’d recommend this class if you’ve already taken anatomy (I hadn’t) and I’d actually recommend it over LS1b too for premeds, just because of the more mature environment, more interesting content, better grading, and the greater insight it will give you over LS1b. Drag one of your friends into it and you’ll be fine. Visits to HMS were also super fun and a good experience.",0.9956,I would not recommend taking this course simply because it is very difficult to do well.

The content seems like it would be especially useful in language documentation work, and generally helps with developing a deeper understanding of how language is produced in terms of sounds.

The assignments’ rate of decline is practically exponential – they get significantly harder by the end of the semester, and you’ll find yourself in office hours every single week just to get by. The readings are wordy and full of confusing technical jargon, and you will procrastinate them every single week. The lectures are also full of jargon and largely difficult to follow. The midterm and final are sort of okay as long as you really study for them, but again, if you’re not a Ling concentrator, you’re still probably going to really struggle.

Lecture attendance is mandatory, yet I never really felt like I got anything out of them and always had to re–learn the concepts outside of class. We also often had to learn things for exams that we either didn’t learn in enough depth (for example, we got tested on the chain rule before even officially learning it) or weren’t even relevant to intro–level calculus at all. Grading on exams is very harsh; for example, even if you get the correct answer, you will lose credit for the entire problem if you don’t include a specific step or piece of information that he wanted you to include but didn’t specify. Despite how hard it is to get decent scores overall in this class, Oliver does not offer any opportunities to improve your grade. I did like the CAs as they were really chill people, but most of the grading and obviously the teaching isn’t done by them. My final grade in this class ended up lowering my GPA pretty significantly, and I’m extremely frustrated as this really isn’t the type of class that should be negatively affecting your GPA this much. Unfortunately, for this class and instructor specifically, the results I got did not even closely match up to the amount of effort I put in.

He designs the course with the intention of teaching us the concepts in a digestible manner without making the course stressful or overwhelming. I made the move to 1b after taking Math Ma in the fall, and it was probably the best decision I made for myself. While taking this course,  you still need to put in the time to study for the exams and complete all of the psets, but there are plenty of resources available to do just that. I recommend going to the MQC to meet other and do your psets together, or finding a person that you can go to to work on psets together. The exams can be a bit challenging, but if you prepare thoroughly, then you can definitely pass them. As for the psets themselves, depending on how you grasped the topic, how long they take can vary. For me, the worksheets done in class readily prepare you to complete the pset so they can take between 1–3 hours to complete (but the time goes by faster than you realize). I do recommend starting them right away though so that you don't have to worry about them since there are 3 psets a week, but even if you don't do it right away, you will be fine. But yeah, I can't emphasize this enough, take this whenever Amadeus is teaching because he's literally one of the best math teachers here .",0.9857,"Do not be scared to ask stupid questions! There are no stupid questions, as long as they advance your understanding.  Most people probably have taken zero or few college math courses before this so everyone tends to be a bit nervous. You also don't need to be a ""math person"" to succeed in this course. Just attend office hours for psets if you're struggling and you should be able to get through them quite quickly. I would also recommend forming a study group with 1–3 people in the course so you can check your final problem set answers. MQC is honestly not very useful to me so I didn't end up using it at all.

I think that having a strong AP Calculus AB background is all that is needed to take the course. This was my first official math course at Harvard, so having an AB and BC AP foundation was useful.

I think every Harvard student should take both multivariable calculus and linear algebra because of how useful it is, so definitely either take the Math 21 series or the Math 22 series. I would say that I learned a lot in the class, but there are certainly downsides to the course as it is structured. I'll list the 3 biggest Pros and Cons as compared to Math 22A (according to my friends who took that class) so you can decide what's best for you:PROS:– The class is structured in small–group setting, so you don't have to deal with large lectures if those aren't your thing (this was the main reason why I took Math 21 over 22)– The support network is very good (CAs and MQC were super helpful!)– Very many people take the class and there are several section times so you can schedule it for whenever you like pretty muchCONS– 3 Problem sets a week. This is the biggest issue with the course . It means you have to constantly be doing math homework throughout the week– Your experience in the course is very dependent on how good your TF is, so if your section isn't good, you'll probably need to switch to learn most effectively– There is usually no curve / a very minimal curve to the classIf this course ever gets changed to be just 1 pset a week and not 3, then definitely take it over Math 22, but until then, use your best judgement.",0.9952,"It's very difficult and easy to fall behind in.

So. If you enjoyed 21a and liked its structure, I recommend you take this class. Yes, the tests can be hard sometimes. Yes, the psets can take up a bunch of time. Yes, at some times the course can be a little disorganized. BUT if you're willing to put in the work and live with some of the inconveniences, you will learn some pretty fascinating concepts in this course. In my opinion, a ton of material in this course can be extremely applicable to other disciplines, and overall getting to truly understand the concepts and their implications can open your mind to a new way of thinking about math and modeling situations using math. If you find the right section with a section leader you enjoy and find the right group of people to study with, you will find that the material isn't too bad and that the social atmosphere of this course can be actually good at some times. Yes, it's a course that's definitely not for everyone, but if you enjoy the math and the people, you'll find a way through it.",0.993,"The way the course material is taught along with the structure of the course makes it very difficult to learn the topics. We are assigned a new topic every homework and then the topic is taught to us in the following class, as if we’re expected to teach the topic to ourselves. It seems that all math intro courses are set up this way, and in my opinion is a TERRIBLE way of “teaching” math material. Unfortunately, this is a concentration requirement for myself and many others and I would not recommend 22 if one is struggling with math 21. Instead, I would try to be proactive with giving extra time for readings, going to extra help hours, etc. Unfortunately that means learning the material for this class will take much longer than it needs to (than if they taught the material to you in class FIRST before assigning homework)",-0.8144,Matt is honestly a gem and I recommend the course purely from how wonderful he made the layout and the effort he puts into the class. The course itself will take a substantial amount of time (3 psets a week and mandatory lecture attendance 3 times) and require you to think a lot more theoretically for how to problem solve. I would recommend this class if you’re willing to put more effort into your mathematical career. Very enjoyable if you’ve taken a linear algebra and differential equations class in the past.

Sadly, Chris is leaving Harvard this year so look at who the instructor is teaching this class before making your ultimate decision.With that said, this class changed how I thought. Coming in with little proof–based experience (taking 22a the prior semester), this class fundamentally altered how I thought about mathematics and logic. Math 25a takes your intuition from calculus, rips it apart, and puts it back together, all while leaving you with a greater understanding than a computational–based class could ever provide. The first third of the class––dealing with point–set topology––will seem a little dry, and at times very abstract and difficult to think about, but it will be worth it once you reach the second third of the class: sequences, series, differentiation, and integration. From there, the last part of the class feels a little less interesting––moving into sequences of functions and ultimately multivariable calculus (of which you will pick up notions from differential geometry along the way).However, because of how much this class augments your proof–writing skills and builds mathematical intuition, I cannot recommend this class enough. This class will be hard––some weeks, you will spend 20+ hours on a PSET and it will be mentally exhausting. However, it will all be worth it. I strongly urge anyone on the fence between 22b and 25b to take the latter––it will change your brain!!!",-0.2645,,0.0

Professor Siu was an unreasonable lecturer, leaving  every single student confused and lost in every lecture, while showing little to no empathy. The lights in our classroom (which are motion sensored), would often turn off multiple times in class, because no one was paying attention. Prof. Siu didn’t care that his students were lost – he only cared about getting through the material. Our TFs were also equally lost, and openly admitted that they did not know what was going on in 113. Our TFs also shared that we learned everything taught in Math 213, the graduate level version of this course. It felt unfair at many times throughout the course when our TFs were unable to explain concepts learned in class, or answer questions in office hours. That being said, the material learned in 113 with Prof. Siu was absolutely beautiful. Complex analysis is such an elegant area of mathematics, and you really feel proud of yourself after completing each problem set, which were all extremely difficult. While it bothers me that this course was not taught at an appropriate pace, this is still probably my favorite course taken at Harvard. The material really is so beautiful, and I am actually thankful that Prof. Siu truly pushed everyone to their limits. Because of this, my mathematics skills flourished exponentially. For that, I will be forever grateful.",0.948,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH SIU. I REPEAT, DO NOT TAKE THE CLASS WITH SIU. I cannot stress enough how horrible this experience was. I will try my best to write something coherent, but the TLDR is to run and never take a class under Yum–Tong Siu. He has lost all touch with reality.I took Math 113 to satisfy my analysis requirement for the math joint. I was advised to skip 112 and go into 113 because that is what cool people do I guess. Regardless of whether this is true or not (I can maybe see why it doesn't matter too much to know 112 content, but it would definitely help), that means I was already at a disadvantage. Little did I know that Yum–Tong Siu was completely out of his mind. It's all still too raw to write anything coherent, but I can say a few things:First, except for the first homework which was so easy it was hard to believe it was a higher–level math class, not a single homework took me less than 13 hours. Again, keep in mind I am a dumb math joint so this is probably not the same for others. But what I can say is, at some point during the semester, the CAs who were really really knowledgeable and smart and had taken 213 (grad level complex analysis), could still not solve all the problems. What's more, every time during office hours I would learn that the problems in our 113 homework were problems from previous years' 213 homework. How is this reasonable? I have no idea...The pace is incredibly fast. I have friends who took this class last year, and even they complained about it being hard. But we were all surprised when we realized we had already covered EVERYTHING they covered in previous years by week 5. How? I could not tell you. I have no idea at what point it got this bad this fast, but anything past week 6 was already grad–level complex analysis. And I want to stress how real this is, I promise it is not just me being dumb and complaining about it. The description of the class on the class website reads: ""Analytic functions of one complex variable: power series expansions, contour integrals, Cauchy's theorem, Laurent series and the residue theorem. Some applications to real analysis, including the evaluation of indefinite integrals. An introduction to some special functions."" If you look at the class website, you'll see how we were done with all this by the end of February, and still had two months to go... was it useful? No. Did I learn anything? No.Now, for the true problem: THE EXAMS. We had a closed–book take–home midterm and final. I want to emphasize the CLOSED–BOOK part of them. You were not allowed to use any resources while taking them. Even before the midterm, we tried to convince him to let us have a cheat sheet or something, but he said that we shouldn't worry about it, that it shouldn't be too hard and it was just meant to test a general understanding of the content. LIESSSSS. The midterm was basically another pset: 6 pset–level questions to be solved in 4 hours (which is a problem if on average they take more than 10...). And the final were 12 pset level questions in 8 hours.I am honestly too traumatized to keep writing about this, so I'll stop. If this is completely incoherent, I'm sorry. It is all just too raw. I hated this class. Do not take anything Siu teaches (although I feel obligated to say he is a really nice guy to talk to, just completely detached from reality.)",-0.9183,,0.0

In terms of getting a strong grade, if you have a solid background in math then you can for sure get an A if you obviously take the necessary time on the PSETs. Wes also wants to encourage rigorous mathematics, as people who have only taken the Math 21 series can take this class. You have to get 20 Group 2 points throughout the semester (so averaging roughly 2 a PSET), and you can get extra credit from going over 20 (maxing out at 28). The class also has 2 midterms and a final. They vary in difficulty, but they are certainly fair.  They are all open–note, take–home & unlimited time for a week. They are structured almost like a PSET. The final was definitely more challenging than the two midterms. The course heads also took latex notes, which was very helpful (and so attending class was not a necessity). Wes also wrote the textbook we used in this class.

By the end of the course I was able to look back on it and say that I'm glad I did it and that a lot of the theorems learnt were very interesting and beautiful, but somehow while I was taking the course this definitely did not seem like the case.For a little background, I came in to the course initially due to my curiosity with how seemingly completely innocuous questions (Fermat's Last Theorem looking at you) could drive humanity to develop such an incredibly rich subject, and while I did sort of find a bit of closure on that question (through doing my presentation which was one of favourite parts of the course), I was (very surprised) to find that during my experience of actually taking the course, I was really struggling to understand the motivation behind a lot of the material. Long story short, a combination of the p sets being bashy (I say this as someone who is also interested in physics btw – some of the most horrendous matrix manipulation you will ever see is on Math 129 p sets) and very disconnected from lecture, lecture being very bizarrely structured (Prof Mazur did in fact introduce a lot of great things to keep in mind – you just never understood why they are important the first time they are brought up), and the book being exceedingly annoying to navigate (a running joke amongst people who have taken this course is the fact that every single time you are doing work for Math 129, you need at least 5 tabs of Marcus open at the same time just to do one part of one p set problem), somehow made the material feel like a massive slog during the course, which is a great shame because I definitely did not expect things to feel this way.  (P. S. the exams are both hard and sit down, so if you're anything like me who has the memory of a guinea pig expect to have to do a crap ton of memorisation of definitions and proofs to practice for the exams – didn't really give it my best effort tbph and I TANKED; will leave it up to you to decide whether that's your cup of tea, especially in a subject that in my opinion is one of the harder ones to gain good intuition for)Other than everything I just mentioned though, I thought the course was really good – Prof Mazur (as I said earlier) is a legendary figure in the subject and being in his presence was very humbling. He says a lot of good things and is very to the point with his students, which I think is something that is unfortunately missing in this day and age; the TF team was fantastic, but special mention to Eric Shen who did a fantastic job preparing review materials for the course, answering my questions and helping me understand things in a way that I was able to better appreciate both the small details and the broader view of where the material fit in, all while being his usual humble and caring self. With regards to grading, I must say initially found TF Eliot Hodges' grading rubric about ""writing"" very annoying, but tbh by the end of the course I actually appreciated it – it was nice to get someone with more experience to keep me accountable and help me understand what was and what was not accepted as formal mathematical exposition. The material itself is beautiful – its got a different feel to it than some of the more theory–oriented maths courses here like algebra/topology/analysis. Initially I was frustrated because it just seemed like we were being handed a bag of tools for random bashing – but I would say that by the end the theory started to come together and the role, significance and true nature of each tool became much more apparent. It is, however, for me, hard to grasp, as a lot of the mathematics itself was really quite involved – multiple–lecture–long proofs were common (with like 3 asides and 4 presentations sandwiched between them just so to make it even harder to figure out what was going on, obviously), as were definitions and theorems that had so many pieces to them that it is almost comical trying to describe them verbally to someone else (just to give you an idea of what I'm talking about, one of the statements of the theorems starts with ""Let K, L, R, S, P, Q, G, D, E, r, e, and f be defined as above"") – but all in all I thought it useful personally to recognise that confronting a subject with a lot of fine detail and ""little pieces"" so to speak was where my weakness lay and I will for sure spend a decent chunk of the summer trying my best to fix that. So yh, on a purely academic standpoint I'm glad I did it.So, a decent class with some ups and downs – don't romanticise it too much in your head but also don't find this review disheartening especially if you know that the subject is something you have a lot of intrinsic interest for, I'm sure that there will be very many others who felt differently to me. If I were to take this course again I definitely would have read up more on background and motivation (also making sure not to schedule another class during Prof Mazur's office hours would probably have been a good start lmao) and also would have tried to be more present in the course community (had a strange delusion that soloing this course was the way to go; please don't). Definitely did enjoy it overall though and would recommend.",0.9984,"The material is quite dry, and the text (Marcus) was unbearable. Mazur is a semi–effective lecturer.

Highlights included the geometric proofs of Noether's theorems and of course the derivations of the Einstein equations. Puskar did a great job of motivating concepts and proofs with geometric intuition that made abstract concepts pretty intuitive. I did not take 136 and got by fine, but would definitely recommend taking it before if possible. This class is like a substantially lighter version of 230b.",0.9914,,0.0,,0.0

This translates to very interesting and instructive homework problems, which I had a lot of fun doing.Overall, I'd recommend this course, especially if you're an alg–geo / alg–top pilled math concentrator that doesn't want to do any actual analysis (the material of Riemann surfaces gets very geometric in a lot of places, though be warned that analysis is sometimes involved too!).",0.9566,,0.0,,0.0

All aspects of the course were rewarding – Prof Hana Kong's lecturing (I know, it was at 9am but it) was superb, office hours were helpful, p sets were very challenging but were also interesting to think about – just really really good stuff.I feel like in 231A we developed a lot of interesting raw machinery that was cool to learn about in isolation but we didn't really do all that much with it, and it was only in 231BR that we really got to apply it – the general theme of 231BR revolved around studying fibre bundles, we did this in good depth and learnt a lot of interesting facts about how to make sense of their geometrical information using the theory we have developed. I think the switch of textbook from May last term to Miller this term (though of course with a few minor hiccups, for instance we were kinda expected to intuit what Postnikov/Whitehead towers were and the Brown Representability theorem was swept under the rug one or two times, but definitely not anything major) was very smart – it was a cool choice for sure having 231A be slightly more category theory heavy than necessary (with correspondingly otherwise conceptually more simple material and have easier p sets) and 231BR be more concrete with genuinely harder material to grasp and more difficult assignments, as I felt that I was sufficiently–well–armed in with fluency in the language and the terminology to start thinking about the more finicky concepts. Definitely would say that the material this term got a lot heavier on the detail and the machinery, and correspondingly the algebraic and geometric sides of the subject had a much more dynamic relationship than in 231A. Regardless, Professor Kong did an outstanding job in lecture and in office hours explaining the material in its most natural form, and I felt like good intuition was conveyed throughout the course for what was going on. Don’t think I will ever see better teaching of spectral sequences.Do establish a good p set group going into this course though, as I feel like 231BR (even more so than 231A) was a course where trying and checking many ideas is an important part of the learning process and it is genuinely way more fun and rewarding to do this together with someone else.Overall, a great class that I recommend to everyone who enjoyed Math 231A and would like to take a first step into understanding how the tools developed there are used in the modern mathematical scene.",0.999,,0.0,,0.0

The labs were sometimes tedious, but overall not bad. – My tf hosted office hours directly after section/lab time and I found it helpful to do as much of the psets as I could earlier in the week and then stay after lab for office hours to ask any questions I had. I also found SSN a helpful resource. – In terms of PIEs I found it helpful to make my reference sheet by scrolling through the lecture notes and taking notes mostly on bolded words (definitely make sure you know the bolded words) and important concepts, and then taking the practice PIEs and adding to my notes based on anything I found confusing/got wrong.

It's really satisfying seeing how the material from the spring builds upon material from the fall – all the science you learn really *integrates* together. For example, linear algebra is the *basis* for Markov chains which *feeds forward* into neural networks and then suddenly dynamical systems is back to provide a *stable* foundation for models of action potentials. There is so much interesting material in the spring – I especially enjoyed Markov chains, protein structures, and computational sequence analysis. My one note is that the linear algebra crash course is very fast so it might be helpful to prepare for that. You really won't find another class like this. Not to sound dramatic, but LS 50 has the power to change the way you think and approach problems, and an important part of this comes from having the experience of the entire year. Sure, in LS 50A Bayes' Theorem might just sound like a fancy name for two way probability tables and what even is a prior, but when you actually put it into words and apply it to hypothesis testing in the context of sequence analysis, it suddenly becomes concrete and relevant. who knows, this might become some arrival–esque thing where you start to think of your life in terms of ls50 material – there's enough of it to go around.LS 50B is a chiller course than LS 50A – easier psets and exams (and no stat mech) – and by the spring you'll already have had a whole semester to get accustomed with the idiosyncrasies of LS 50, so that altogether makes for a more relaxing experience.

Make sure you know the equations inside and out, Ince they hardly asked you to solve for stuff you have never solved for before :)I consider this class to be a semi–grad class.

The class has improved my scientific literacy through the weekly journal article assignments. The workload is manageable and light compared to other neuro classes with psets. However, make sure to study in advance for exams because the course covers a lot of material in a short amount of time and the exams can get pretty specific.

As a whole, MCB 197 is likely one of the best classes I have taken thus far at Harvard, especially as it relates to my interests as an MCB concentrator. Given how it was the first year that the course was being taught, I was extremely impressed by how organized the class was, and how receptive Professor Whipple was to feedback.In terms of changes, the main area where MCB 197 can be improved would be the Problem Sets. As opposed to having quizzes/exams, the class incorporates 3 Problem Sets which constitute 30% of your total grade within the class (10%/PSET). At the start of the term, it was made very clear that no collaboration was allowed on the PSETs. However, while this would normally not be an issue as long as students attend Office Hours, MCB 197 was set up in a way where the TF’s were unwilling and unable to provide concrete support when it came to questions on the PSETs. It got to the point where we were individually warned to not ask anything specifically related to a Problem Set question, and to instead focus on more broad and large–scale topics. This resulted in Office Hours seemingly like a complete waste of time and a continuous search for answers and help that never came.Next, the course also introduced something called “Breakout Sessions” which were short assignments done within the last 15 minutes of class, both as a way of applying our newly learned knowledge and as a way of tracking attendance. However, the setup of these assignments were very inconsistent and they went from being included in almost every class to suddenly being completely gone once we got deeper into the course. Additionally, while we were initially told that Breakout Sessions were solely meant to be a form of practice (meaning that we just had to submit what we had by the end of class), they randomly changed them to be completion–based and required students to finish the sections we couldn’t do in class as homework. During weeks where we had PSETs, this timing made the Breakout Sessions very inconvenient and stressful.Lastly, at the end of the course, students are provided the opportunity to choose a disease and engineer a “cure” using a therapeutic we discussed in class. While this is a very interesting concept, the actual application of the project came relatively rough. At the start, students are asked to turn in a Project Proposal and receive feedback. Less than a week later, students are expected to provide a Revised Proposal, where they narrow down their topic choice and provide a slightly more detailed plan. Then, a week and a half after the Revised Proposals, students are expected to turn in their Capstone Poster, which outlines their full project, disease, and cure. In reality, this timeline ended up being extremely inconvenient, as feedback for the proposals (especially the revised one) were not received until the weekend before the entire project was due. Additionally, there is an exponential increase in the content included in the Revised Proposals versus what is required from the Capstone Poster. Going forward, it is absolutely necessary for this timeline to be revisited and revised, as it makes it nearly impossible to complete the project in a timely and high–quality manner.Overall, despite these minor issues, MCB 197 remained an outstanding course. Most of these are smaller issues that will improve with time, and can be linked back to it being the first year that the course is being offered. However, the willingness of Professor Whipple to accept (AND APPLY) feedback truly gives the class the extra boost, showing how the teaching staff truly care about the student experience.

Generally, Music 1 is a fun class to engage with music through time and allows you to reevaluate the role music plays in our everyday lives. The listening responses can be quite difficult if you have no music background (and even if you do have music background), especially in the first half of the semester when you need to differentiate between different classical works. However, the class is weighted such that most of the weight is on the assignments you complete outside of class, rather than in–class listening quizzes or midterms.

Clara is an amazing TF, very engaged, kind, and always willing to help outside of class. Fed is a wonderful lecturer and his passion for and understanding of music are truly unparalleled. I whole–heartedly agreed with every single comment he made on the performance or interpretation of the pieces we discussed; it was truly a privilege to  learn about this music from him.If you're interested in music at all (which I assume you are if you're reading this ;)), you absolutely must take a class with Fed!

Class discussions were both great and not great. Not much (traditional) philosophical work was done.Great introductory class to moral philosophy concerning sex, love, and friendship. In this first iteration of the class, a significant emphasis  was placed on whole–class discussions. This was great in some ways, and not so great in others. The discussions were often interesting, funny, and perspective–bringing. Additionally, students' commentary gave Professor Schouten material to work with and helped guide her lectures. However, the amount of time we spent doing class discussions came at the cost of Prof. Schouten actually lecturing. As such, I left many classes wishing that she had lectured more and communicated more of her thoughts on the philosophers' arguments. This brings me to my greatest criticism of the course. Despite the content being engaging, Professor Schouten being amazing, the class discussions being fun, and the readings being relevant and carefully chosen, this course wasn't exactly a philosophy course. I understand it's an introductory course. Even so, we spent remarkably little time actually doing philosophy. Most lectures, we would spend at most five or ten minutes trying to understand the philosophers' arguments (instead, we spent more time understanding their claims and we thought about their claims). As a result, most of the philosophy work happened while writing the two papers. That being said, it's clear that Prof. Schouten has a different perspective on what counts as philosophy, so we definitely did a lot of philosophical–ish discussion.",0.9937,,0.0,,0.0

I cannot overstate the profound impact it had on my understanding, especially in an era where misinformation and distrust proliferate across digital platforms, this course equipped me to critically question the foundations of authority—who is deemed credible and why—and how these determinations contribute to significant health inequities, violence against women, and other detrimental societal outcomes, all stemming from a predominantly male–informed hegemony.In this class, I've learned to scrutinize the production and dissemination of knowledge, recognizing that even the scientific practices used in the labs for my thesis are embedded with biases that influence how research is approached, interpreted, and understood. Science isn't just about cellular structures but also involves the behaviors and minds behind them, which are open to interpretation. This course provided me with a vocabulary to articulate and challenge the systemic inequities embedded within institutions like Harvard, highlighting the need for a more inclusive and critically aware academic environment.This course revealed the paradox within ""elite"" academic institutions like Harvard, which, despite their progressive facade, often remain entrenched in traditional, white male–dominated paradigms that perpetuate epistemic injustices. This resistance to diverse perspectives and ideas undercuts their mission to foster genuine academic discourse and truth–seeking.Harvard and similar institutions urgently need more courses like this, which challenge us to critically examine our biases and the broader epistemic harms inflicted across all demographics, including white men. Understanding these dynamics is critical for everyone, as it prompts a more inclusive exploration of truth, moving beyond a single, universally accepted narrative to embrace a multiplicity of truths.One of the first readings for this class by Linda Zagzebski emphasizes the significance of epistemology by linking the value of truth and knowledge to what we care about in life. She argues that caring about truth is crucial if we care about anything at all. The reason why we should care about knowledge stems from its inherent value and its instrumental role in enabling us to live well by aligning our beliefs with reality.Zagzebski elaborates on the notion that truth and knowledge are not merely desirable for their own sake but because they enhance our engagement with and understanding of the world.Moreover, epistemology is important because knowledge is often linked to the good life. Knowing true things about the world can help us make better decisions, avoid harm, and pursue our goals more effectively. We should care about knowledge because it enriches our lives by helping us to engage more meaningfully with the things we value.Zagzebski's point is that epistemology isn't just about trivial debates.  It's about understanding how to achieve the kind of life most of us would value – a life informed by truth, understanding, and intellectual growth.In taking this class, I believe I have moved closer to uncovering the truth by peeling back the layers of bias and resistance that have historically marginalized diverse voices.If you're interested in understanding how the concept of a ""universal truth"" can be weaponized to oppress marginalized groups, I highly recommend taking this course.",0.9984,,0.0,,0.0

As much as the instructors are absolutely great people, they are NOT doing their jobs when it comes to delivering lectures accessible to students who are taking E&M for the first time.This has got to be the worst class I’ve ever taken at Harvard, both in terms of its organization and the lack of support available. —While it may seem as though support is plentiful via the office hours, that is actually untrue. Most of the OH’s are led by undergrads themselves who tend to cancel last minute or change locations or dates, making it quite impossible to schedule ahead of time. I do not sit around waiting for just your office hours. I am busy and have commitments, and would seriously have appreciated the consistency that this class is absurdly missing. This happened at least once EVERY SINGLE week.—At one point in the semester, in–person sections were also changed to “pset review sessions”. When you would enter the Zoom call pset review session, often, no one would be there and you would sit in the Zoom waiting room for the hour, with no one letting you in. This class is a blatant lie when it comes to the support.—Labs were straight up useless and I didn’t learn much besides how to connect random stuff, with no real explanation on what was going on. Some of the labs were scheduled in such a way that by the end of the semester, we were covering lab concepts that hadn’t been covered in lecture yet. Nevertheless, they graded us based on the same rubric as students who had seen material before.—My advice is DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Avoid at all means possible– even consider 15 or AP50 series if you’re really desperate. If u still decide to take this class, my advice is : Lectures are useless. Do not go or waste your precious 9am sleep time to attend. It is 10000X MORE EFFECTIVE to just study on your own. I survived by reading the textbook by midterm 2.—Most lectures are just “solve this problem” no context. How the problems even remotely relate back to the actual concepts you have to know for exam was not explained. If it was explained, it definitely was not clear enough and felt convoluted.—In fact, many of the lecture were so disorganized and timed wrong such that we wouldn’t actually get to certain concepts in class. Some time later, there would be a video posted– no announcement– nothing.

If you put in the work, study regularly, go to lectures, and do the homework and practice problems, then you will succeed in the course. The course staff is really great, and they always want you to succeed. The course staff are very supportive, and there are also many opportunities to get extra credit in the course. The grading is very fair and generous. The material is also very interesting, and there will be different demos and experiments each class that help you understand the topic better! Overall, I would highly highly recommend the class whether it is a concentration requirement, or as a way to fulfill a pre–med requisite!!! TAKE PS3!!",0.9911,"Not only are the lecture inefficient, but the class is organized in a way that is not conducive to student learning. As much as the instructors are absolutely great people, they are NOT doing their jobs when it comes to delivering lectures accessible to students who are taking E&M for the first time.This has got to be the worst class I’ve ever taken at Harvard, both in terms of its organization and the lack of support available. —While it may seem as though support is plentiful via the office hours, that is actually untrue. Most of the OH’s are led by undergrads themselves who tend to cancel last minute or change locations or dates, making it quite impossible to schedule ahead of time. I do not sit around waiting for just your office hours. I am busy and have commitments, and would seriously have appreciated the consistency that this class is absurdly missing. This happened at least once EVERY SINGLE week.—At one point in the semester, in–person sections were also changed to “pset review sessions”. When you would enter the Zoom call pset review session, often, no one would be there and you would sit in the Zoom waiting room for the hour, with no one letting you in. This class is a blatant lie when it comes to the support.—Labs were straight up useless and I didn’t learn much besides how to connect random stuff, with no real explanation on what was going on. Some of the labs were scheduled in such a way that by the end of the semester, we were covering lab concepts that hadn’t been covered in lecture yet. Nevertheless, they graded us based on the same rubric as students who had seen material before.—My advice is DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Avoid at all means possible– even consider 15 or AP50 series if you’re really desperate. If u still decide to take this class, my advice is : Lectures are useless. Do not go or waste your precious 9am sleep time to attend. It is 10000X MORE EFFECTIVE to just study on your own. I survived by reading the textbook by midterm 2.—Most lectures are just “solve this problem” no context. How the problems even remotely relate back to the actual concepts you have to know for exam was not explained. If it was explained, it definitely was not clear enough and felt convoluted.—In fact, many of the lecture were so disorganized and timed wrong such that we wouldn’t actually get to certain concepts in class. Some time later, there would be a video posted– no announcement– nothing. Yet, these concepts are important and magically happen to show up on the exams.—PSets are nothing like exams and contain unnecessary details that weren’t explained in lecture.

Long story short, the course really has the potential to be the best undergraduate course in the department, but there are many shortcomings to it that I think are impossible to overlook.	Let me start optimistic. 	I am in strong belief that Physics 175 has some of the most if not the most interesting material out of any undergraduate physics course in the department. Studying both classical and quantum approaches to optics, with their various degrees of formality, all give tremendous insight with regards to both theoretical (seeing how the various levels of model simplification in classical optics make themselves amenable to the description of key phenomena of light) and experimental (studying the immense scope of applications of the simple principle of interference) considerations, as well as physical (thinking about the behaviour of Gaussian cavities, geometrically interpreting time evolution of superpositions of spherical harmonics) and mathematical (the multitude of natural and beautiful applications of harmonic analysis, most notably the duality between convolution and multiplication of functions) intuition. 175 is also one of the main undergraduate courses where one sees both classical and quantum theory in action, which both makes it an important history lesson, both in terms of the theory itself (seeing how one would go abouts forming true quantum analogues for our beloved classical objects such as the theory of coherent state solutions of the quantum harmonic oscillator) and in terms of the experimental tools that quantum optics has gifted to us (notably laser theory, which is a wonderful playground for a lot of interesting ideas in the experimental side of physics). It has all the ingredients to be an absolutely beautiful segway into modern AMO that I am certain many students would find both fun and useful to take. 	Secondly, the problem sets in this course are absolutely the star of the show here. None of them are particularly long or overly bashy, and so are definitely not a huge huge time commitment, yet I feel like they are some of the most well–constructed problem sets I have seen from any course I have taken at this school. Unlike certain other aspects of the course, they are written to appeal to a wide range of interests, and often are able to give tremendous amounts of important physical and mathematical intuition and to serve as an excellent way to make sure you actually understand what is going on in lecture. (The interference problem set deserves a special mention for contributing 100% of the intuition I now have for what Fourier theory actually tells us, despite the existence of several other courses in maths and physics that I have taken which have made absolutely pathetic attempts in comparison to do the same; doing the problem sets for the quantum optics unit of the course genuinely helped me stop panicking about the class and about whether I actually understood what was going on). The problem sets are relatively light compared to some other courses in the department but definitely not completely trivial – it can be pretty hard to figure out what to do when you're stuck – but they definitely make the course feel like a good bang for your buck. 	Thirdly,  TF Lev Kendrick did an absolutely incredible job and has been a shining beacon for helping me clear up all misunderstandings I have had in the course. He is fantastic at gauging his students' backgrounds and re–explaining the material in the course in a way that would maximally benefit them. I will recommend any course that he TFs.	 Onto the bad news.	Unfortunately, I have not really been a big fan of Prof. Greiner's lecturing this term. He clearly is an incredible physicist with an absolute fortress worth of wealth in terms of physical intuition, but two main aspects of his teaching have kept me a bit apprehensive about the course. 	Overall, I felt as though the presentation of the material, although done in an order that makes a lot of sense, was rather disorganised. Prof Greiner's poor blackboard management makes lecture incredibly difficult to take good lecture notes from. If one's attention slips even for a short while, one can and often will find themselves completely and utterly lost about what is going on. The real highlights of Prof Greiner's teaching are the excellent snippets of intuition that he gives verbally during lecture, which would be perfect in an ideal world where everyone had perfect focus and was able to jot down exactly what he was saying in real time, but of course this is not possible. It also happens that Prof Greiner goes through all calculations incredibly slowly on the blackboard (this is especially notable during the second unit when long QM calculations seem to be a ubiquitous culprit with regards to ensuring that the student will lose track of what is going on conceptually), which thus makes it especially hard to catch the real takeaways every time he goes through a computation. Not only that, but if one attempts to look at the lecture notes he posts on Canvas to try and understand what happened, one is usually left disappointed as these are incredibly terse to the point where it's often difficult to even decipher what exactly he is trying to illustrate. All of this resulted in me spending more time finding out what was going on than actually trying to understand what he was saying, which made for a somewhat frustrating course experience.	Prof Greiner's amazing physical intuition is extremely beautiful to watch, but often his attempts to convey this intuition result in correspondingly huge losses in mathematical rigour. I'm all for presenting us with a clear setup of a problem or example followed by a clear statement of the final result if the computations involved were sufficiently routine, but Prof Greiner's lack of rigour made it sometimes quite unclear what it even was that we were trying to bash in the first place, which is not ideal when you're learning the material for the first time. Lev again was instrumental in helping me deal with this, and even helped elaborate some more on some of the relevant underlying mathematics (if you ever wondered what taking complex analysis in physics was useful for, I have finally found it to be used a nontrivial amount in AMO), but it was sort of frustrating waiting for section or office hours to clear this up nonetheless. I feel kind of bad complaining about this to be honest, as I am really grateful for Prof Greiner's focus on intuitive explanations – these get harder and harder to come by as you get higher up the department and knowing exactly what some of the maths is telling you definitely gets difficult in 175, but I just wished that there was sufficient rigour to make it clear exactly what his intuitive approach was trying to justify. 	It really is a shame that Prof Greiner's genius was not conveyed to me as much as it should have been this term, but I think the issue might just be that currently the course is designed for people wanting to go into an AMO lab for summer/ term–time research, when the course could be adapted to accommodate a larger range of backgrounds and interests. Having spoken to a few upperclassmen doing undergraduate research in AMO, they seem to all have really appreciated how much perspective 175 gives them in their lab work, and I am completely not surprised – I just think it so happens the course has the potential to be an absolutely fantastic introduction to AMO that would be received better by a much wider range of physics concentrators had it just been a bit more clear and organised, and I guess I am just somewhat frustrated that the course is not attaining its massive potential.	As usual, none of my physics department Q guides would be complete without a discussion about prerequisites, so here we are. I personally think that to gain a meaningful understanding of the course content, Physics 153 (or equivalent) as well as a solid first exposure to quantum mechanics would be ideal. The first of which I would argue is important as Prof Greiner does not really go very far into the theory of electromagnetic optics in 175 (stuff like wave guides are left completely undiscussed, for example) and it is also assumed that one has knowledge of D, P, H and M fields for example to talk reasonably about birefringence. Of course, quantum principles are essential for understanding the theory of quantum optics – I specifically did not recommend Physics 143A as I believe that to be an insurmountably terrible course whose horrendousness is not often realised until long after its completion; if that is your quantum background coming in (as was mine), you will be alright but be prepared to be horrified in 175 by how absolutely insignificant your knowledge and intuition of quantum mechanics would be coming out of that (which to be honest is probably a good character–building moment, I just have a lot of residual resentment for it still a year and a half later). Haven't taken 15c so I can't really judge on how good that is as a means to prepare you. Essentially, if you have a decent working knowledge of QM, a knowledge of EM optics, and know a couple basic wave principles, you will be ok.	Again, a course that in my opinion has the potential to be the physics department catalogue's shining star, but currently with some very high highs and (in my opinion) some definite lows. Will still definitely recommend the course in its current form if you don't really mind the things I discussed, just so you could see for yourself how interesting AMO can be.",0.9994,"I personally didn't like this course all that much. While the quantum optics material was pretty interesting, Professor Greiner did not give good lectures in my opinion, and made the material a lot more confusing than it could have been.

My second–favourite course of all time, Physics 210 was a truly fantastic experience. I came in to the course with high hopes and little intuition, just purely interested in the course to learn about ""the most beautiful scientific theory of the 20th century"", and let's just say it did not disappoint. 	Let's start with the star of the show. Prof Jacob Barandes is an outstanding lecturer who clearly cares an incredible amount about his students and physics education as a whole. His endearing and respectful personality, excellent board–work and fantastically engaging presence just made lecture an absolute joy to be in. Combining this with how much he cares about presenting the historical development of the physics and his emphasis on instilling within us a genuine, intuitive conceptual understanding of the material has resulted in GR lecture actually giving me goosebumps and leaving me in awe of the material on very many occasions. Informal chats with Prof Barandes at the end of lecture were great opportunities to gather further perspective on the material, learn about his fascinating research and hear what follow–up questions other students have, leading to a wonderfully vibrant academic climate in the course that I will look back upon fondly. The course staff in general were excellent, but a well–earned special mention and thank you goes to TF Rui–Zhe Lee, for his great patience, knowledge, humility, kindness and approachability. 	The material itself really lives up to its legendary status in physics. I really enjoyed the discussion of relativistic field theories that leads up to the derivation of the linearised Einstein Field Equation in unit one, which I understand to be something that is uniquely covered in Jacob's course, as it really nailed home the similarities in construction between Maxwell's Electrodynamics and General Relativity. The third unit (on the physics of curved spacetime), was the heart of the course and possibly my favourite section of any class I have ever taken – the final two weeks, an incredible collage of the astrophysical phenomena that the theory allows us to describe, was genuinely instrumental in keeping up my excitement and curiosity for physics through what is normally an exceedingly stressful time of the year. Overall, there are one or two lectures that are in my opinion need a little rethought, and depending on one's level of mathematical maturity the middle section of the course might feel a bit out of place pace–wise, but otherwise I am in strong agreement with the course's current structure. In general, Physics 210 just does a brilliant job of acting as a very necessary confluence of all the little streams of knowledge flowing in a student of theoretical physics' mind (Courses on Analytical Mechanics? Electrodynamics? Quantum Mechanics? Pure Maths? Pop science exposure (desperately in need to be rephrased rigorously)? They all combine here to make one beautiful unanimous whole).	Physics 210 is in general known in the department as a course in which the coursework is famously ""bashy"". Whereas I will not attempt to dispute this, I will say that Professor Barandes does make the experience far less painful than it would otherwise be by making most of the quite involved computational problems be key steps in results that we establish in lecture, so that even when we are in agony bashing tensor calculus on a blackboard late at night in Jefferson, we are constantly reminded of the significance of what we are doing each time we review the course material. In addition, unlike in some pretty infamously glaring examples of physics courses on this campus, one does find that in Professor Barandes' problem sets that staying close to one's organic mathematical intuition when solving problems does give a clearer picture of what is going on – always is a great plus to see a course be built upon solid conceptual understanding in all its aspects. Just a heads up – please do have a TF around when you try getting off the ground for the first time with Einstein notation, I was fortunate to have it be carefully walked through the first time around which was very helpful as I got the chance to integrate it very naturally with my structural intuition of linear algebra quite well early on before things started becoming too involved.	As is typical in my Physics department Q guide reviews, I feel a need to give my take on the prerequisites of the course. I am of the opinion that one will benefit the most from Prof. Barandes' Physics 210 having previously done Physics 151 and 153, and have the mathematical preparation of Math 22 or equivalent. None of my recommended prerequisites are formal requirements of course (besides like basic mechanics including Newtonian gravitation, and of course Linear Algebra and Several Variable Calculus – just a heads up these are most definitely completely necessary), but I am of the view that 210's narrative will make the most sense for those with the background I have just described – the physics discussions of the course will assume familiarity with the language of classical field theory with Maxwell's Electrodynamics being frequently revisited as the de facto example, and the mathematical discussions of the course will assume familiarity with the notion of an abstract vector space, for example, and will present mathematical ideas at the aforementioned level of exposition. Minor detail, but I will however put a word against having done a differential geometry course beforehand, however, as one would put themselves at risk of not enjoying the middle unit of the course as much as they would otherwise – not saying that one would find it dull (I have heard that Prof. Barandes' GR teaches Math 136 better than Math 136 does, and I can imagine that this is true), just an ""I wish I learned things the other way around"" kind of feeling if you get what I mean. This is definitely specific to Prof. Barandes' 210 though – I have heard that other versions of the course tend to do a less thorough treatment of the mathematical side of the subject, in which case it would probably make more sense to disregard what I just said. Definitely speak to more alumni of the course to get their views on this however, as I feel like this is both a subtle and a subjective thing to discuss – I'm just presenting my view on the matter.	Overall, a phenomenal course that I would recommend to everyone interested. I strongly believe that every student of physics will be at a stage in their education where Prof Barandes' GR would be an excellent addition to their catalogue; if you capitalise on this and take the course at your ""proper time"" (no pun intended), Physics 210 truly has the potential to blow your mind every lecture and remind you of how exciting life can be as a student of our wonderful subject.",0.9993,,0.0,,0.0

The problem sets aren't easy, but for me most of the challenge was in recalling the right definitions and scouring the lecture notes; I didn't have a great picture of what was going on but still was able to do the PSets. And then halfway through the year, the problem sets just stop (and there are no tests, so really no one is checking that you learned a single thing after Spring break). If you don't take this class, you'll probably never see or do any cosmology, so I think it's worth taking. But actually try – no one will make you.

At the end, the course reminded me of thanksgiving dinner again, when everyone would start gathering and telling stories, but on occasion some of the older people would start randomly throwing shade at literally everyone on the dinner table. Final presentations were interesting to sit through because everyone presented on really interesting stuff, and it gave us a good idea of what doing research in high energy theory even begins to feel like. but during every single presentation, prof schwartz was quite critical of each presentation and really drilled us on our familiarity with our projects. its very intimidating at first considering that some of us might be very new to presenting, but in retrospect it really is good criticism, and its good to help us get accustomed to the kinds of questions that people will ask. what really stood out to me is that at the end of the drilling, prof. schwartz would still commend each group on their effort and reassured us that we did a great job despite the difficulty of our topics. this in my opinion is what made him such a great teacher, and what made this class bearable and enjoyable to look back on even though the concepts were not the easiest to understand.",0.9976,,0.0,,0.0

I really enjoyed taking this class with my fellow undergrads because subir was so memeable that this course became very fun even though the psets were not fun at all. the material was very important to know for condensed matter, but there is an implicit requiremnt that you already know quantum field theory before taking this class. Subir basically explained 3 weeks of a qft class in a 1hour lecture, and that left huge repurcussions in our understanding of the material afterwards. Serhii tried to fix that but I don't really know  whether that worked. moral of the story: DO NOT LET SUBIR LECTURE FROM SLIDES. my understanding of the course just rapidly dropped towards the tail end of the course because he jsut started speeding up exponentially, which wasnt great. but overall, i manage to keep coming back to his class because it is without a doubt that he is very entertaining to watchSerhii was good, he knows a lot of stuff, but he was sometimes incomprehensible. not sure whether its my fault or his. he also has a very strange sense of humour which i strangely appreciated. quite helpful sometimes for homework, but he likes to take off tons of points on the homework for very small things.",0.9886,,0.0,,0.0

Otherwise, Ashley was great and the class was pretty laid back!",0.983,"This is Dr. Leung's first class and I'm cautiously hopeful future versions of this class might be better—but I definitely wouldn't recommend the class without significant changes. Every aspect of the course had major issues, and it was not well–run or organized at all.  The lecture component of the course was not engaging and Dr. Leung did very little teaching. Instead, 2–3 students would present on the week's readings and introduce a new paper, and then those students would generate discussion questions and lead the discussion. Essentially, the students taught all of the lectures. This structure did not work well at all—the presentations were very long and discussions were not engaging. Most of the time, it felt like the sections would have been the same with or without Dr. Leung present. The class would be much more enjoyable and engaging if Dr. Leung presented the readings/the week's topic and led the discussions herself. Or perhaps, minimize the role of student lectures, so they only present for 10 minutes on a supplemental study and then Dr. Leung can take over. Because of these issues, class was an absolute waste of time. Grading was a huge issue in the course. On the last day of finals, we still only knew 5% of our grade (a research proposal assignment). It was incredibly frustrating—we had no idea how we were doing in the course at all. Grading was incredibly slow or did not happen at all. It would have been less stressful if she updated the grades throughout the semester, or even eliminated something to incorporate a short paper in the first half of the semester, just to distribute grade updates a bit more. We didn't have our grades from leading the discussion, and the two major assignments outside of that were presenting and writing a research paper. I didn't get the order wrong—she had us present our fake studies first and then turn in the paper later. Which brings me to my next point...The structure of the final presentation and paper made absolutely no sense. It would be far more sensible to write the paper first or at least submit a draft or outline or something (which might have also distributed the grading a bit more and give students some time to revise). Because the paper was due on the last day of finals, most people had not even begun writing. The presentations would have been much better if there was some sort of incentive to write the paper first. Or—switching the order might help. Change it so the paper is due first and the presentation is after that.Overall, the course was incredibly poorly run, unengaging, and overall, not a good experience. I'm hopeful future iterations might be better—but as it stands right now, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",-0.2202,,0.0

While the emphasis on personal and religious exchanges among students during class and section sessions initially seemed promising, the disconnect between these discussions and the essay assignments is glaringly problematic. Despite the engaging class dynamic, the essay prompts are excessively ambiguous, and the grading criteria provided bear little resemblance to the actual grading standards. Unbeknownst to students, the expectation seems to be to craft serious philosophical papers referencing academic sources that are never explored in class. This incongruity between the lighthearted nature of the class discussions and the rigorous demands of the essay assignments is deeply frustrating. For instance, in one section session, we found ourselves engaging in fortune–telling activities, further underscoring the disparity between the course's tone and its academic expectations. Overall, the lack of clarity in expectations, coupled with the harsh grading, renders this class profoundly unsatisfactory. I advise against taking this classs unless one is specifically seeking this unusual combination of elements. It certainly ranks as the most disappointing class I've taken at Harvard.",-0.8898,,0.0

The fact that you receive 8 credits for one course and satisfy the language requirement in one semester makes it a ""really good deal."" That offering for this course is completely merited though. You really do learn the full contents of French 10 and French 11 and leave the course as a shockingly decent French speaker. The course is well–structured, though there are times where it feels like you may learn a bit ahead of the pace of course as it takes time to get to tenses/grammatical phrases. The idea of having everyone create a character in a Parisian appartment building is unique and makes the course a bit more fun. All the work that's completed for the class genuinely does improve your French ability.You'll leave this course ideally at the B1 CEFR level which is pretty good. I actually feel like I can somewhat speak French now and that's pretty remarkable for just a semester of work. Showing up to a class 5 days a week isn't for everyone (and when they say 5 days a week, they really mean 5 days a week since the syllabus allows for very few missed classes). Fortunately, our class met at 12pm which isn't too early, though attendance may be more challenging if this course is offered at an earlier time in the future. I have few criticisms of this course. It did always feel weird that it was run by Dr. Mills technically even though it didn't seem people in the course interacted with her. Anselme, the actual teacher, was excellent and cared about our learning French and fully addressing all our questions. Another thing is that you'd expect a class with ~15 people meeting every weekday to cause people to forge some strong friendships, but, to me, it seemed like everyone in the class liked each other, but that nobody was particularly close. That's not even a strong criticism, just a counterintuitive observation.If you're interested in French, want to get your language requirement done, or like learning quickly: take this course! It's pretty well–run, you'll learn a lot of French, and the 8 credits is pretty nice. The grading always feels fair, and as long as you attend and submit things on time, you'll probably do very well. The one strong piece of advice I have is to do all of the homework exercises each week. They don't take very long, and while you could just look at the answer key, I don't think most people do because it's a very good learning tool. I always took my time on the exercises and then corrected them after because it always filled gaps in my knowledge in a pretty efficient amount of time and also prepared me well for the quizzes. I'm glad I took this course, and look forward to being able to speak more French. I originally dreaded dealing with my foreign language requirement, but after my positive experience in French 15, I may take more French classes at Harvard.",0.9985,,0.0,,0.0

Whether it is practicing your speaking, listening comprehension, or reviewing grammar structures, make sure you are getting the most out of the resources available to help you thrive in your French class.At first, I was pretty scared about taking the class just by the name and the fact that we needed to speak more often.

This class will require effort, but it is fun, and you will improve your speaking and writing skills immensely as long as you put in the work.Oh!

She actively prepares for every session – and we all could tell that she put in hours of preparation for every lecture. She was confident about the material she taught, and she was very knowledgeable in every aspect of the language and its technicalities. She engaged us and encouraged debate about the topics we discussed, fostering some of the most intellectually rigorous conversations we have had in our college careers thus far; with her guidance and pointers, we not only better understood the points we were making as well as the opposing perspectives, but we learned how to do it all in Spanish. Xiomara also took the time to meet with so many of us individually to ensure that we not only understood all the topics, movies, and grammar we discussed, but also understood how to apply it in our daily lives and how to use the words and grammar we learned in our everyday conversations. Xiomara spent hours beyond the scope of Office Hours and Class to meet and make sure we all understood the material being taught. That is only the tip of the iceberg as to what makes Xiomara an amazing teacher and mentor.Xiomara prioritized learning for learning's sake. She made class discussions fun; this was the class we all looked forward to. Not all language teachers allow for such an educational and fun atmosphere, one that every student wants to go to: Xiomara is unique in this respect. And it paid off: we all feel more fulfilled and more knowledgeable than ever before, as a result of Xiomara and her teaching. There are not many teachers who are as passionate and as caring as Xiomara is, yet are also as effective. We learned more in Xiomara class than we did in some other classes taught by well–seasoned Professors. And that is a testament to her genuine passion for her students and the material at hand.

I know that put me off at first, but you get so close to your classmates & the professor is so kind & supportive it ends up being so much fun.Make sure to pay close attention to the passages the professor highlights/focuses on in class & take notes on them because they will appear on your homework assignments/exams.Make sure to pay close attention to the hw assignments & what you click because although you get three tries for the homework, they take the average score and not the highest.Overall this is a very fun and manageable class!",0.9712,,0.0,,0.0

Lecture was once a week for two hours which was also great because Prof Weir lectures the first hour to provide background and context and then we discussed/looked at interesting passages for the second hour. Sometimes the readings were a lot for one week but I found them to be quite worthwhile and enjoyable. There's no other homework and the other assignments were two papers. I felt the grading was good, not inflating but also not super harsh. Feedback was given and I felt it was constructive but also recognized good writing too. Section was every other week which was great, we could talk and discuss in smaller groups but not weekly because some readings didn't need it/sometimes we'd spent two weeks on authors or books.

Each assignment/reading was extremely engaging and related directly to our class discussion.  This course had an appropriate balance between the amount of student input and lectures from Professor Gundorova. Unlike some other area studies courses where students are asked to provide far too much feedback instead of the professor, this class was very well balanced. Professor Gundorova came wholly prepared for each lesson to place each piece of literature in the historical and cultural context, providing me with quintessential cultural and historical knowledge about Ukraine and the larger Soviet literature scene. The reading material was also very diverse, spanning classics of the early twentieth century to controversial modern pieces from 2024. Through these materials, we explored topics essential for students hoping to become experts on the region (usage of the Russian language in Ukraine, Soviet Ukrainian Experience, post–Soviet Ukrainian experience, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine from a cultural & historical perspective).",0.9537,if you are still hesitating whether to take a class with Professor Gondurova – just do it.,-0.34,,0.0

After one year, I went from speaking no Ukrainian to speaking at the advanced level. So, how was I able to make progress so quickly? Professor Shpylova–Saeed is the reason. She masterfully incorporates all the required elements of language instruction to ensure that her students are not only making incredible progress but also staying enticed in the cultural and historical elements of Ukraine. The structure of the course includes one weekly course in addition to a one–on–one meeting with Professor Shpylova Saeed. During the course lecture, students dissect a reading or multi–media exercise that they read/watch beforehand to practice spontaneous speech for nearly an hour and a half. However, the most important element is the one–on–one class session with Professor Shpylova–Saeed, where the student decides on the topic, including something they are researching, reading, or an element of the language that they are having a difficult time with. These sessions were critical for me to make the jump from limited to advanced proficiency in Ukrainian. Professor Shpylova–Saeed shows an incredible mastery of Ukrainian, providing the answer to nearly every question, from grammar to language style. Additionally, she is unparalleled in her passion for promoting Ukrainian culture, keeping all the students informed of any opportunities to continue their study of the language and culture. The best example of this dedication is Professor Shpylova–Saeed’s monthly Ukrainian club meetings that she organizes. She invites students of all levels of proficiency in Ukrainian and interest in the culture to discuss current topics related to Ukraine with some of the incredible staff and faculty at Harvard, like Serhii Plokhy and Tamara Hundorova. Professor Shpylova–Saeed also organized a Ukrainian dinner night where students got together and cooked all kinds of Ukrainian dishes! This class is a fantastic opportunity for all those hoping to make incredible improvements in their language ability and learn much more about Ukrainian culture than is possible in almost any other course at Harvard University. Even for those who might be struggling with the complexities of Ukrainian, I guarantee that Professor Shpylova–Saeed will provide the necessary tools and instruction to overcome any difficulties while also providing a profound understanding of Ukrainian culture and history.",0.9914,,0.0,,0.0

Adaner has also been my favorite professor. The class was unlike any other. Lectures included a lot of discussions and questions from us students. By the third class (maybe even end of second) Adaner knew all of our names and it was always a very comfortable environment to ask questions / speak up in. The classroom was very small and centered around a large table; I got to know everyone in the class fairly well. This was all compounded by starting a few minutes late usually (so conversations beforehand always happened) and taking a 2–5 minute break in the middle of class, which was also awesome for other obvious reasons – I think almost all classes should have breaks. We would do a group stretch before breaking, too.The content was presented to us in such a logical way and really worked from ground zero up. Number–premise arguments are simply the best; Adaner uses them everywhere. The readings are really interesting, many are quite dense and tough but the general argument can be extracted without too much time and some skimming (which is what the weekly assignment is), and I didn’t always skim but sometimes I felt intellectually strained reading them and that they would require more time to get full value from, which I didn’t always have.The assignments were a ton of fun and really make you think, which should be the point – but they weren’t too time consuming. I do not think it is an understatement to say this class will have significantly altered the course of my life.  Take it! I'll end with this fact – not to flex, but to highlight how much I valued the course: for what I think is the first time, I did not miss a single class– I attended every single Tues/Thurs lecture, which took some luck but also just me wanting to come.",0.9811,,0.0,,0.0

Time Statistics:I kept strict track of time spent on everything productive I did over the semester.

Notice that the first couple weeks of the class were unbareably hard because of its long psets. I had an amazing schedule. I was waking up at 7, sleeping at 12, etc. I was on top of my game! I was doing all the readings for my classes. I was writing my reading responses with so much attention to detail. Then, the third and forth psets came in. They hit me like a truck! I pulled an all nighter for each of the psets even though I put in 50 hours a week for my classes overall. The ripples from those all–nighters made my whole semester miserable. Because I pulled an all–nigher, my other work had to be delayed. Then, the work after that got delayed. Stat 111 caused a domino effect that ruined my semester. I unequivically blame Stat 111. I have no extracurricular activities. The ones I was in, I gave up on ALL of them, just to be able to keep up with myy classes. How can a pset for a class take ~20 hours to finish? None of the CS124 psets took that long. I got an A in Stat 110 and in 111.  The concepts in both I love and I have covered somewhat before because of math olympiad. I got the psets done. Every week. I pulled back–to–back all–nighters because I am not a quitter. But the psets were simply too tedious for the first 4 weeks. Legend has it that one of those weeks, MORE THAN HALF of the class had not submitted the pset by the deadline and took the extension. I was determined to not take them since I knew that my second half of semester would be even worse (it was worse indeed). Because of this, apparently, Joe decided to give everyone an extra extension. IT DOES NOT HELP to make the course lighter after the fact. I couldn’t care less about the easier weeks afterwards because they are not the issue here.Make the time commitment an even 13, heck an even 16, but do not make it 27 hours one week and 7 some other week. I pulled a total of 7 all–nighters for this class. Having done all those all–nighters, I think my life was shortened measurably. I think I might have killed millions of neurons in pursuit of perfection in this class. I blame myself for creating my schedule first, but then I blame Stat 111 next. In total, I spent 169 hours on this class. With that, this class takes third place among all the classes I’ve taken with CS61 and CS124 coming in first and second with 196 hours and 180 hours total respectively. If the course continues like this next year, please use your extensions on the earlier, tedious psets. The later psets, as seen in the data, are relatively fine. Anyways, how to do well in the class? Know stat 110 well. Know your conjugacies, know your pdfs, know the properties of the distributions you’ll be working with. Memoryless property, chicken–egg etc. Read the stat 111 textbook (a new addition to the course this year). The textbook is amazing. It has too much info that is not all relevant to the class.  But the textbook is a superset of the class. Read the book and the lectures will become review. If you read the textbook, you’ll also see special derivation etc. that will give you new methods of problem solving for the psets. You better go into the class with a pset group. My god was it necessary. You should to be able to talk through problems and ideate. Going to OH for every question is hard. Collaboration within the confines of the collaboration policy is key. The TFs are nitpicky. The grading RUBRIC is nitpicky. The psets were graded out of 48 for most psets and each question has an excrutiating amoung of subparts. Each subpart is worth, say 1 point. YOU WILL LOSE 0.5 of that for the smallest of reasons. Note that your psets are worth 45% of your grade and so each pset is almost 5% of the grade. Be as perfectionist as possible. Double proofread just to make sure. The smallest things! Because of the denominator, each small loss adds up quickly and suddenly you might find yourself with whole percentage points lost on your final grade because of silly mistakes. A friend of mine experienced this. I repeat, BE PERFECTIONIST. There are exponentially diminishing marginal benefits to another round of checking your pset. But you do want to get an A, right? So buckle up and do it. I did not go to a single lecture for the class. Totally unnecessary. Watch them all online. I have a panopto extension that allows me to watch the lectures at arbitrary speeds. Watch it at a speed comfortable to you. I watched at 2.5–3.5x speed. Frequently stop the lecture and take notes. That way, it will come out to be about 1–1.5x speed still, but you will get a series of notes out of it. On that note, please take notes. It helps a lot with review and you better believe you will need that review material come midterm and final season. This class, similar to Stat 110, is extremely well staffed. The stat department is really good at this (at least for 110 and 111). There are office hours in convenient times and locations almost all days. Even as a quadling, I had access to 4 different office hours in 4 different nights. Thanks here to Jamie, Nick, Shea, and other TFs that I am currently unable to remember on the plane. Tips for R, LaTeX and submissions:For R:Learn how to vectorize everything! It significantly increases your productivity and reduces execution time. Functions such as replicate, sapply, lapply together with anonymous functions are VERY helpful for coding up stuff. Watch some tutorials and it will pay dividends as the semester goes along. There will be a lot of times where you will have to do some calculation/data generation and then repeat it for some B times. I recommend writing a function that does the procedure for one iteration of it and then using the replication/application functions mentioned above to process it for the total B times. Ends up being very clean and fast code. Learn to use the documentation. Use ChatGPT for your graphing needs. You have the data, let GPT handle the specific code needed to display it well.  R Studio:Its a piece of S**t. Compared to VSCode, it is garbage. But you are sort of stuck with it. I explored running R in VSCode, in NVim, etc. None are as good imo. LEARN THE KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS. Please! I cringe everytime someone manually goes to the beginning of a line to change that line to a comment. Use Ctrl+Shift+C instead. Learn how to copy and past whole lines and reorder them with just alt lol. If you have the time, change the shortcuts to those you are familiar with. This will noticably improve your quality of life. When you're close to the deadline, the last thing you want is for your progress to be halted by R Studio. How to put code in your pdfs? Here's my process. I hated R Studio, so I only used it to **write** my R code and test it. Once done, I used RTEX to compile my final doc. I use a VSCode extension called LaTeX Workshop to compile latex on my local computer (eliminates reliance on janky harvard wifi and Overleaf). This extension can be used to write rtex files as well. The workflow goes as follows: Download that week's pset. Optionally generate a pdf for my ipad with more spacing between questions to handwrite some answers. Copy the .tex file into a separate folder and name it with the .rtex extension instead. copy over csv files and resources that the .tex file needs to the same folder. Whenever I want to insert R code, I write the following incantation: <<cache=TRUE>>= [MANY LINES OF R CODE HERE]@.The extension neatly runs the code and plugs in both the result and the code into the pdf file. Super convenient. The cache=TRUE allows for computation to not be repeated for each LaTeX compilation round since simulations can take some time to finish.  It only reruns if you change the code withing the incantation. Writing latex itself is slow and so I try to write in the fastest medium. Questions about explaining intuition are done in RTeX. Questions about code get done in RStudio and then the code gets copy–pasted into Rtex as well. Having done the pset, the pdf generated in computer is sent to ipad for final assembly with handwritten answers. Never had an issue with using handwritten submissions for some questions/parts.Midterm stats: Direcly from Joe: mean = 67, SD = 22. (first quartile, median, third quartile) = (52, 70, 85)Final Stats not released. I feel stockholm syndrome from this class. It might have convinced me to do stat AB/AM instead of the CS AB/SM. See my other reviews for the many woes of the CS department. The concepts you learn here are invaluable. Together with Stat 110, this class has literally changed the way I think and my everyday language. Cs124 was tedious too, but also almost nothing from it stayed with me. Stat 111 though, has changed the way I have discussions with my friends. The concept of conditioning is really the soul of statistic and perhaps rational judgement itself. Not to get to philosophical here, but this class will change how you think, period. Do I recommend the class? You bet I do. Suffer through it and come out the other end a new person. Battle scarred, but a veteran. I wish you serenity for the many frustrations you will experience with the class and for the many all–nighters you might embark on. May you stand unshaken amidst a crashing world.",0.9986,"Unorganized in terms of class structure and support, highly theoretical in terms of content. I genuinely don't think my STAT 110 knowledge helped that much with this class, and I also don't think I'll retain 92% of what I learned by September. I only really started getting content and seeing the big picture 40 minutes into the FINAL, but by then, it was too late, of course. The psets were just bad representations of what was taught in class and what would be tested on exams; many of the problems were stuck on nitty–gritty algebraic and math concepts and tested little on the actual statistical concepts. They were also INSANELY long; on the surface, they'd have 3 problems, but each problem would have (a) through at least (e) or (f) parts (there was one ungodly pset that had several problems of (a)–(j) length), and they'd just be variations of the same question with different numbers. So, I did not consult any of my homework while making my cheat sheet nor when studying for the exams. Lectures too are highkey very unhelpful; I was simultaneously enrolled, so I would watch the lectures afterwards, but by the middle of the semester, I just stopped because I wasn't getting anything useful out of them. The textbook was similar and, in fact, was particularly theoretical. I literally asked my dad's friend (a stats professor at Indiana University) to help explain some concepts and shared the textbook with him, and he fully said that this is NOT content that they teach in a beginner stat class unless it's for grad students. The only really useful components of the class were section, section notes, and the 1 on 1 office hours that Skyler piloted (AMAZING program, PLEASE continue it); otherwise, we had to fend for ourselves.I was a little wary about this class going in because I had heard horror stories, but I had also talked to some people who said they enjoyed 111 more than 110 (and also that the class had some relevant concepts to AP Stats, which I enjoyed in high school lol) so I was slightly intrigued. I don't know what they were on, but 111 is objectively NOT more enjoyable than 110 unless you enjoy and want to pursue theoretical stat research and go to grad school and be a statistician like Joe, in which case, by all means take this class.  Honestly, this class has discouraged me from taking another stat class again, which is just disappointing.",-0.9119,,0.0

Whenever I want to insert R code, I write the following incantation: <<cache=TRUE>>= [MANY LINES OF R CODE HERE]@.The extension neatly runs the code and plugs in both the result and the code into the pdf file. Super convenient. The cache=TRUE allows for computation to not be repeated for each LaTeX compilation round since simulations can take some time to finish.  It only reruns if you change the code withing the incantation. Writing latex itself is slow and so I try to write in the fastest medium. Questions about explaining intuition are done in RTeX. Questions about code get done in RStudio and then the code gets copy–pasted into Rtex as well. Having done the pset, the pdf generated in computer is sent to ipad for final assembly with handwritten answers. Never had an issue with using handwritten submissions for some questions/parts.Midterm stats: Direcly from Joe: mean = 67, SD = 22. (first quartile, median, third quartile) = (52, 70, 85)Final Stats not released. I feel stockholm syndrome from this class. It might have convinced me to do stat AB/AM instead of the CS AB/SM. See my other reviews for the many woes of the CS department. The concepts you learn here are invaluable. Together with Stat 110, this class has literally changed the way I think and my everyday language. Cs124 was tedious too, but also almost nothing from it stayed with me. Stat 111 though, has changed the way I have discussions with my friends. The concept of conditioning is really the soul of statistic and perhaps rational judgement itself. Not to get to philosophical here, but this class will change how you think, period. Do I recommend the class? You bet I do. Suffer through it and come out the other end a new person. Battle scarred, but a veteran. I wish you serenity for the many frustrations you will experience with the class and for the many all–nighters you might embark on. May you stand unshaken amidst a crashing world.",0.9986,"Unorganized in terms of class structure and support, highly theoretical in terms of content. I genuinely don't think my STAT 110 knowledge helped that much with this class, and I also don't think I'll retain 92% of what I learned by September. I only really started getting content and seeing the big picture 40 minutes into the FINAL, but by then, it was too late, of course. The psets were just bad representations of what was taught in class and what would be tested on exams; many of the problems were stuck on nitty–gritty algebraic and math concepts and tested little on the actual statistical concepts. They were also INSANELY long; on the surface, they'd have 3 problems, but each problem would have (a) through at least (e) or (f) parts (there was one ungodly pset that had several problems of (a)–(j) length), and they'd just be variations of the same question with different numbers. So, I did not consult any of my homework while making my cheat sheet nor when studying for the exams. Lectures too are highkey very unhelpful; I was simultaneously enrolled, so I would watch the lectures afterwards, but by the middle of the semester, I just stopped because I wasn't getting anything useful out of them. The textbook was similar and, in fact, was particularly theoretical. I literally asked my dad's friend (a stats professor at Indiana University) to help explain some concepts and shared the textbook with him, and he fully said that this is NOT content that they teach in a beginner stat class unless it's for grad students. The only really useful components of the class were section, section notes, and the 1 on 1 office hours that Skyler piloted (AMAZING program, PLEASE continue it); otherwise, we had to fend for ourselves.I was a little wary about this class going in because I had heard horror stories, but I had also talked to some people who said they enjoyed 111 more than 110 (and also that the class had some relevant concepts to AP Stats, which I enjoyed in high school lol) so I was slightly intrigued. I don't know what they were on, but 111 is objectively NOT more enjoyable than 110 unless you enjoy and want to pursue theoretical stat research and go to grad school and be a statistician like Joe, in which case, by all means take this class.  Honestly, this class has discouraged me from taking another stat class again, which is just disappointing.",-0.9119,,0.0

The TFs are usually life–savers when it comes to doing the homeworks and the project so please use them as a resource!! You will learn a lot in this course about biostatistics and biomarker research. But! If you expect to come out of it an expert on the topic such that you could confidently and extensively analyze a biomarker dataset without any mistakes or questions, you likely will be mistaken. There are lots of times in class when things went over my head and my biggest qualm is that many important concepts were not mentioned in the notes but only brought up verbally or on the board in class so if you didn't listen/show up that day/take notes, you will not learn them. Or even if you did, you might not remember them later. Especially if you didn't super understand it at that very moment. The bad news is you will not be able to understand every little concept that is brought up on an intuitive level. Some things will go over your head. The good news is you can still do super well (A) in the course even if you don't understand every little concept extremely well.  This doesn't mean you won't learn a lot, you absolutely will, but I am just the kind of person that likes to learn 100% of every concept and never leave a class feeling like there was a concept that I don't intuitively understand. Also some kids will have taken other higher level stat courses like 181 and sometimes, even though they're not required, some concepts from these courses will be brough up and you'll be expected to know them. This is easily resolved with a google search but you should know it going in. Tbh, it's a great choice for people interested in bioinformatics/biostatistics who have taken 110,111, and 139.

Not only is the content fun, but 171 also is taught at a very reasonable pace, so I was never overly stressed out about this course. Subha is also a fantastic professor ––– probably one of the best lecturers I've had thus far at Harvard. Highly recommend this course for any stat concentrator or just anyone passionate about stats/problem solving.",0.9915,"This is a great course that provides a solid foundation in the fundamentals of stochastic processes. I would highly recommend taking this course. Background: The main background you need in this course is a solid understanding of STAT 110. Familiarity with linear algebra at the level of MATH 21B is sufficient. Multivariable calc isn't really that important, as the only thing you really use it for is taking partial derivatives, which you know how to take if you can do a regular derivative.  Lectures/Textbook: I found lectures easy to follow, as Professor Sen is a great lecturer. He follows the course textbook pretty closely, which is helpful. The textbook is the best resource to fully learn and understand the material in this class, and you should definitely read the textbook. Homeworks: The problem sets were pretty manageable. I would recommend solving the problem sets on your own before going to OH or checking with a peer. They also aren't too time–consuming, and I think a student on average probably spends maybe 4–6 hours per problem set to do well.Sections: Not really that helpful, as no one showed up (to the ones I went to at least, and the TFs would sometimes go really quickly over problems and concepts. Exams: I found exams to be fair and reasonable, but they should be taken seriously, and you should do a lot of practice problems to prepare for them. The exams being 75 percent of the grade can be a bit scary, but I don't think that should disincentivize you from taking the course; if you get anxious about exams, you can do well on them by doing a lot of practice. Almost everyone in the class did pretty well on the midterm (average was in mid 80s for both exams), so keep that in mind. Since I think there was intent to not make the midterms too difficult, the grade distribution on the midterms weren't really spread out and didn't really differentiate students based on gaps and understanding that much. For instance, on the second midterm the difference to getting the average and the third quartile could basically come down to getting one true/false question and perhaps a minor algebra error somewhere. But I think since the distribution of scores on the midterm is really narrow, I wouldn't worry too much about the midterms if you get around  or a little below average, as I think the final exam can have more impact on your final grade. I think there might be comments saying the final was really hard, and I expected the final to be quite difficult based on previous reviews of the course, but I think the final was quite reasonable, if you do sufficient practice with the material beforehand. This also might be due to the final testing stochastic calculus and Brownian motion, which can be the hardest topics in the course, but you can get really comfortable solving problems if you do lots of practice. Here's how I prepared for the exams:1) I would create a cheatsheet. This helped me review the specific formulation of definitions and theorems and their assumptions. This year, Professor Sen allowed us to bring one–page one–sided cheatsheet to midterm 1, a double–sided one page cheatsheet to midterm 2, and a three single–sided pages to the final. You can fit all the course content (definitions, theorems, main results) from the cheatsheet, and should still have some room left over to include other stuff. 2) I did the practice problems given to us. Professor Sen gave us about 6 practice problems for each of the midterm sand final. I did them under timed–conditions, but they're not really a practice exam, more of a collection of practice problems. I didn't feel as if the problems were all super relevant to exam problems, and some of them were a bit weird, but you should definitely do these problems. 3) I did section problems and textbook problems. The section problems also include problems from the textbook. You should be able to do all the section problems before the exam. I found the textbook problem actually really good practice for the exam, and I think doing a lot of them helped me do well especially on the second midterm and final exam. I think if you block off enough time before the exam, you can probably do a lot, if not all, of the non–R textbook problems in the chapters leading up to the exam. I actually found the textbook problems even more helpful then the midterm and final practice problems that were given to us.Overall, my main advice would just to make sure you do a lot of practice before exams, especially the final, as this class at times really does become an extension of STAT 110–style problem–solving. So overall great course, would highly recommend.",-0.9619,,0.0

I wouldn't really recommend it if you're seriously seeking to expand your ML knowledge. I don't think I really got anything out of the course. Here's a breakdown: Assignments: Most of the course grade is determined by homeworks. There's only 5 homeworks in total and you get a drop which is nice. In terms of workload, the class shouldn't be super stressful if you start the problem sets early (which I didn't always do). The problem sets, though, can be quite difficult, since they're don't involve problems that directly relate to what's covered in lecture. You'll have to rely on prior stat knowledge to complete them. I would recommend going to OH, but it's probably better to just have a pset buddy or two to do the problem sets with. In OH, they're aren't too helpful to be honest. You also have to make sure that your derivations and proofs are fairly rigorous to get full points. I didn't really do that and lost a good couple of points on each homework. The hardest problems on the psets are definitely the No Free Lunch problems, which honestly felt a bit tedious. I don't think I too much away from them. The other main assignments is the course project, which consists of 3 parts: 2 presentations on an ML paper (one applied and one theoretical). Then, you have a 3–page final paper where you propose an improvement to the applied paper. You also have an oral exam at the end where the course staff asks you questions about your final paper. The project is light, but it should be taken fairly seriously if you want to do well. I wrote my final paper in a day and was not prepared for the oral exam at all. Make sure you actually think seriously about it and prepare for the oral exam (which isn't particularly hard, but you actually need to know specific details about the methods you are proposing, you can't just BS it) Lectures: Lectures are also OK. If you're really interested in the theoretical basis behind ML, then you'll find it interesting, but I honestly didn't pay attention to any of the lectures past week 3 and I was doing fine on the problem sets. Overall: I came into this course thinking it would give me much more background on supervised learning in ML (specifically deep learning), but it didn't. I felt that most of the course was just tedious work and I didn't really learn anything from it. Other courses I was considering on taking in place of this one was STAT 171, and if you have the option, I would def choose 171 over this. If you want to take something ML related, then I would definitely just go to MIT. Harvard ML courses just miss the mark for some reason (even though our STAT department is really good, we just don't teach ML from enough of a practical perspective).",0.9932,"In its current state, I would not recommend taking this class. Just taking CS181 will give you most of the background you need in ML application, with Stat195 not adding much. The main benefit of the class is the chance to read and think about ML papers, and getting exposure to some concepts in modern ML theory, but you could probably self–study this. Generally, the psets were tedious and disjoint from what was covered in class. We also did not get sufficient guidance on the final project, inducing a lot of stress.",-0.4127,,0.0

It begins with some basic concepts from stat 210 with some more rigor (e.g., review of conditional expectation and convergence theorems); then, one discusses the Martingale Convergence theorem, uniform integrability, and convergence in L^p spaces. The classic 0–1 laws are discussed, with applications, e.g. in LLN or U–statistics; exchangeability is introduced. Some concentration inequalities (azuma, efron–stein) are proven. The first half of the course then ends with the martingale CLT, which is quite a cool result! The second half then begins with a discussion of Brownian Motion (intro, construction, uniqueness, properties), etc. One then moves to Stein's method. Finally, there is a final project, in which one reads a paper (typically somewhat recent research output), and gives a presentation. Overall, the material is quite fun, and there are a lot of cool theorems and proof methods!~ comments ~The course is organized in a very good manner, as to provide both fundamentals and a bit of an idea of the field. Most courses tend to do only one of the two (or neither). However, the basic material (first half and BM) are done fairly rigorously; occasionally measure theory is swept under the rug, but it can be justified with some (and not too great) effort. The book recommendations are very good: Durrett (PTE) is satisfactory for most of the rigor in measure theory (I spent a good amount of time reading details outside of course–time; it also covers some useful concepts not done in 212), Morters–Peres (Brownian Motion) is a good intro to BM and the later chapters (I read a few extras for fun) cover some surprising and cool facts, for instance geometric properties of BM and its relation to random walks); lastly 'Fundamentals on Stein's Method' (cf. arxiv) provides rigor for the Stein's method parts. I find that the very important fundamentals are done quite rigorously and well; some results are introduced to give a sense of what types of results have been proven, and this latter type is usually not justified, but rather intuition (which is good) is provided. The lecturing is fantastic. The usual way I like lectures to go is to either (1) explicate the material in a clear and engaging manner or (2) provide some intuition otherwise not found. These are both done; the first half of the course especially, Morgane encourages participation and engagement by asking questions about how to proceed; following closely in the course was helpful both in understanding the proofs better and being able to come up with and understand the main techniques of proof (e.g., 'definitions!'). Lecturing speed varies; I found that it started quite quickly and then in the end slowed down a bit. As noted in the last paragraph, I think intuition for the unproven results provided was very useful, whereas the basic facts were justified rigorously (and for these, the intuition often comes from going through the basic ideas and really thinking about the math over and over again). The assignments are fairly chill and fun. There are about 5 HW assignments, with one drop; there are a large number of additional problems and HWs which are very useful when studying the exam or for gaining more familiarity with the concepts (so one has enough problems to work with, but there is minimal stress). The final project was a fun way to see what sort of methods and ideas are being researched in probability (e.g., random matrix theory, Stein's method, etc.). Admittedly, it was pretty difficult to comprehend the presentations, but I enjoyed it because one gains a viewpoint of how the course can lead to later research. Now, a few miscellaneous comments — the exams are not easy, but contain many fun problems. Studying is certainly necessary but the review process is helpful in going through the main ideas of the course, and there are a number of problems and past finals which are enjoyable (there are a lot of 'cute' problems). I would advise one to read the reference materials, both for review purposes, and because they are good classics, which provide a lot of extras (concepts or 'measure theory' etc!) Lastly, Morgane is very approachable outside of class; I went to a few office hours to ask questions, in addition to our final project meeting. She provides helpful wisdom, both in respect to the main concepts of the course as well as life advice, e.g. experiences in grad school, which I appreciate. I came into this semester with a heavy math background and stat 210 deciding that I wanted a change from heavily abstract mathematics to learn more stats — this course has genuinely built my enjoyment and interest in probability and was important in helping me settle my focus in the field; in this way it has been a very important course for my personal path. It also has provided a satisfyingly large collection of resources for further exploration (e.g., there are the three course references mentioned; a collection of papers from final projects, resources for random matrix theory, etc.). If you are considering this course, definitely take it!",0.9994,,0.0,,0.0

The first two weeks are really easy. The basics of Bayes' method, prior/posterior, posterior predictive distribution, etc., and examples are covered (Beta–binomial, Gamma–Poisson). Do not be fooled! The class gets much more interesting (and difficult) thereafter. One–parameter methods (the aforementioned and Gaussian) are discussed, then multivariate models (in particular, the normal unknown–means, unknown–variance, unknown mean–variance problem in one and multiple dimensions); Bayesian linear regression, one lecture on decision theory. Prior choice is discussed, including the noninformative and Jeffreys priors, as well as some special priors (e.g., spike–and–slab, improper). The Dirichlet–multinomial model is discussed, then nonparametric methods and Dirichlet processes; then, mixture models and hierarchical models. The class concludes with discussing model choice (quite important), e.g. the AIC/BIC/DIC/WAIC amongst other methods, and variational approximation methods. Along the way, sampling and MCMC methods (importance, rejection, Metropolis–Hastings, Gibbs sampling) are introduced and used extensively. The content is interesting, and as one can see very thorough. Also, though there are a lot of concepts covered, they are covered each quite extensively, in that details and all the complicated derivations are done fully rigorously and correctly. ~ comments ~Jun is terrific. This course is not known for having the best q–guide reviews. Perhaps the reason for this is one part of Jun's philosophy, which carries over to the course: that the ugly stuff matters in the long run, that one has to do ugly math and ugly coding to get to the real stuff. This is true. And it is reflected in the course — the normal–inverse–chi–squared prior has a PDF which is an entire line long, many derivations run across the page, and the final project had many expressions which were *multiple* lines long and amounted to ~1000+ lines of code. I personally find this very valuable. In a sense, in a class which teaches both the theory and the application properly, the application has to be nontrivial. I think working through a lot of the expressions really improved my ability to do both arduous statistical calculation and especially linear algebra bashes (e.g., multivariate Gaussian and completing the square for quadratic forms became familiar), as well as understand this philosophical point. There are a lot of really clean priors which might be fun and not so applicable, and knowing the entire toolkit and being able to work something out which is accurate on the spot is very important. The experience of working through the calculations and the code really helped me gain a solid understanding of the material. Moreover, not all of the material is ugly — for instance, the first few lecture, the decision theory part, asymptotics and the information criteria, regression, EM, etc. are often the product of one or two clean and very nice ideas. The ideas throughout are nice, and the details are there out of necessity — in a certain sense, the course is all an application of Bayes' theorem (which is very simple)! I would also comment that philosophically, Bayesian statistics is quite attractive, because I personally find probability and statistics to serve the fundamental goal of modeling uncertainty, and Bayesian methods, by offering a posterior *distribution*, are able to do this effectively.The assignments are pretty good. I appreciated the ones that involved coding up samplers in particular, because they were very good practice for implementation.  There were also some problems which involved working in greater detail out things in the course — these problems were also good. Sometimes the BDA problems are a bit weird though, and confusing — I would suggest replacing some of these problems with problems of the aforementioned type. Also, sometimes the datasets which BDA work with are cool but it is hard to get intuition for them and/or they do not feel as important. I appreciate, however, working with these real datasets, which definitely taught me a lot (perhaps different ones can be used though). The course notes are really terrific. I basically now possess a 187 page document of summarial concepts in Bayesian statistics done with sufficient detail (in the places where detail is not provided, one can complete the proofs with what is given). They are genuinely one of the best sets I've seen, and while they occasionally have small typos (also the \ref{} and \cite{} do not always work), 99% of the time they are an excellent supplement. Also, they provide a LARGE number of references to papers. I did not have the time to read all of this, but now I just have a collection of things to read in my free time which are either relevant or foundational to Bayesian statistics (many important papers were referenced), or specific and interesting (including a good number of post 2010 results). The references are great! Jun's OH is fun. I went a few times, and he provides both helpful guidance to the material in the course as well as philosophical discussion of Bayesian methods. He is also very approachable after class to ask for clarification or intuition about the material. ~ the FINAL PROJECT ~ I cannot discuss the course without mentioning the final project which, well, is perhaps genuinely the most difficult short–term projects I have ever tried to do. I think I probably spent over 50 hours working on it, and produced over 20 pages of submission (including figures). Even so I omitted more details, and in a certain sense the project (if someone with more bio intuition were to do the statistics and then elaborate on the biological consequences) could be a miniature thesis. It would be an understatement to say that it was an effort. A serious one. It was worthwhile though — really working with a nontrivial dataset (30k x 268 size; even reducing the size means it is a real dataset) was an important experience. You learn the power of metropolis–hastings and gibbs, and you understand what real Bayesian statisticians do (at least, you get a glimpse of it), you find a lot of odd phenomena which you then realize, which are not immediately obvious from the theory, and you learn to not be afraid of working on any such project again. You realize, when working, how much there is to real experience in the field, and you realize that there is much you don't know, but when your sampler works, then it feels amazing. You feel a bit like a statistics monk (I can pretty easily count how many times I left my room). I remember feeling in–the–zone at some point, in a way I had not felt in a long time, feeling like high–school me being really focused, which provided a rather beautiful work highlight of the semester. From a practical standpoint it is also a bit of a stressful project, in that it took up essentially all of reading week. It was a worthwhile experience and genuinely a great learning effort, but also one should be good at balancing time (study for your other finals earlier, or just spend a bit less time, etc — I was basically in my room after that). Lastly, the grading on it was not terrible, as is the grading throughout the class — a good summary is that the tasks are difficult, but if you accomplish them, your grade will be totally fine. ~ advice ~Overall, this class has laid a good foundational understanding of Bayesian statistics, from the most basic of theorems, Bayes' theorem, and provide a comprehensive view towards a beautiful field — as well as implementation of these methods — and I would advise those considering to take it!",0.9993,Hard to follow and have to spend a lot of time working on the coursework and understanding materials.

It is genuinely everything that you can ask for from a Harvard class. First of all, Sergio is one of the best human beings I have ever met in my life. He is the kindest, most attentive, most fascinating, and most engaging teacher that I have had the honor of meeting. To put things into perspective, he wrote EVERY SINGLE STUDENT in a 70+ student class a personalized, handwritten note at the end of the semester and got us all SCRB 120 T–shirts. His final lecture about his personal moral philosophies and perspectives towards biotech ethics was truly one of the most heartwarming and emotional lectures that I've ever heard. He is enough reason for you to take this class. He is captivating, and you can't help but give your 100% attention to him when he speaks. Sergio cares so much about each and every one of his students and is genuinely one of the best that Harvard has to offer.Secondly, the course content is absolutely vital for anyone with an interest in pursuing a career in science, biotech, or medicine. Very rarely do we have the opportunity to engage so freely and openly about the ethical questions that govern biotech advancements, and as someone with a hard science background, thinking about philosophy and morality was a very new perspective that opened so many doors for me. It's an incredible opportunity to grow as a student in a holistic fashion, and you really begin to think carefully about what the future of biotech will entail and how you will be playing an active role in shaping that future. We talk about so many beyond fascinating topics, and I found myself immensely excited for every single lecture.If you're hesitating between taking this class or not, please take it! I promise you that you will not be disappointed. It's also very very light workload–wise, just a few short weekly readings and a discussion post. The case studies are also really chill — they're essentially just in–class conversations that are graded. It's a super low–stakes way to learn about such important topics with genuinely one of the best professors you'll have the honor of meeting.",0.9979,,0.0,,0.0

Prepare to have your mind–blown every second!!! I left every single lecture with a new appreciation for how amazing biology is and raved to my friends about what I was learning. I cannot recommend this course enough!!!Even things that seemed dull like HPG axis became super interesting. Professor McKinley has amazing slides and is super engaging, so you will come away with a great understanding of the material. We talked about how disease manifests in patients, scientific studies that were fundamental to our understanding of the biological process, as well as bit of epidemiology and ethics/history. I think about the HPG every day when I take my birth control. I wish someone had explained it earlier, but better late than never I guess. Come to class every day, pay attention, ask questions, it is worth waking up for :)PSETs really are doable on your own but start early. For the trickier questions, it’s good to sleep on it. There are a not a lot of assignments so put your best foot forward on these.   Professor McKinley has a zero–bullshit attitude that I really appreciated. It meant the course was rigorous (in terms of meaningful scientific thinking) without being too difficult.   Start thinking of ideas for the final project early!!!!! You will have to iterate a lot and it will be discouraging but once you find something that works you will write an incredible proposal and give a fire presentation and truly will feel so much pride for how far you have come. The course staff is super encouraging throughout so you will overcome initial bumps in the road…  I wish I had put more effort into preparing for fishbowl. Basically you get a list of words and you should know a definition for it to play “taboo” in class. It was easy to “get by” if you knew associated things without really knowing the meaning of the word itself, but it meant some words never really got learned. You get out what you put in. The guest speakers are AMAZING!!!! I learned about so much amazing cutting–edge research (shout out to Smita Gopinath and her lecture about the vaginal microbiome!!! Literally rocked my world). Professor McKinley is super well–connected in the reproductive biology world and brings world–class scientists, ethicists and physicians to speak with the class. Her own research had it’s own lecture dedicated to it, and literally my JAW DROPPED. It is so cool and will change lives one day.   The TFs are super supportive and knowledgeable. If you come in with less of a biology background (eg, not a SCRB concentrator) they are really open to helping you catch up. Be sure to pay attention to the first couple lectures about scientific methods and genetics since those are important to the PSET, do the practice PSETs and come to office hours to check your work on it to address areas of misunderstanding. An early investment here will pay off the rest of the course.  I literally would enroll in this class again if I could. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!! YOU WILL LOVE EVERY SECOND. Makes me feel lucky to get to go to Harvard and learn from such amazing faculty <3",0.999,"Definitely start your research proposal project early, and make sure to get as much feedback as possible throughout the whole process.

Every lecture he recaps what happened last time in case you missed or just spaced out or had a follow up question, which is very helpful. He will also work really hard to spin whatever you said into the correct answer, and isn't trying to quiz you or make your life harder.

Not the sort of challenge you get from psets or essays, but a challenge nonetheless. You'll have to tap into your creativity (which, if you're like me, you haven't done in a while). You'll have to create and memorize movements and lines and cues as part of performances. You'll have to share those performances with an audience of your peers. None of that is easy. But it is a different sort of challenge. One that will refresh you. One that will stretch your mind in a different sort of way, creating more room for the psets and essays and the like. You'll meet genuine people who are attracted to this sort of space; the sort where you can be comfortable. Comfortable being weird and silly. Comfortable stepping outside your comfort zone. A space where judgment is suspended for the sake of exploring, investigating, pursuing, striving for art. I'm glad I took this course. It was anxiety–inducing and nerve–wracking at times. Performance is always that way, at least at first. But I gained more confidence and new insights into how my body can move and communicate.

If you are passionate about Asian/Pacific/Asian American history and Asian/American women's history, this class will be very enjoyable and fruitful for you. It is a great way to gain exposure to more writers, learn about history/imperialism/misogyny/modernization, and build up your back pocket of works you are able to reference. Professor Choi is very knowledgable on the topic and has high expectations for you, even though she will adjust the course to help you succeed! Even though it is a chill and understanding class (as many WGS classes are), Prof. Choi still makes discussions very deep and you will have to read actively! There are not many assessments, which I really enjoyed, besides the big final project, which can be as inventive as you like. I don't think you'll regret taking this class, but it's also not a must–take! Very useful nonetheless to expose urself to more authors",0.9924,,0.0,"TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!! The work is manageable but thought–provoking, introspective, and truly unique. Professor Choi is a gem of a professor and she truly wishes you to succeed. This course gave me the vocabulary to talk about Asian and Asian American issues, as well as being exposed to materials/discussions that helped me to articulate feelings I've had as an Asian American immigrant but couldn't locate prior to taking this class. Even if you aren't of Asian American heritage or of immigrant backgrounds, there is something for everyone to take away from this class. This class touches on issues like feminism, social constructs, modern issues, and history that will enhance your learning experience in your other courses as well.",0.9725

So, I would say take the course at your discretion and for the right purpose. You won't deep dive into theory, although there are academic readings, but you will touch on them briefly and be able to add the reading to your pocket to build on it later. Professor Thompson is an amazing and compelling lecturer, and she puts together a mean slidedeck! Some lectures flew by because they were just so interesting. It's an incredibly fast–paced class though, so keep that in mind as well. I didn't like that we would have really long weekly discussion posts sometimes that would pretty much be left at that, and because section was so brief we didn't have much time to talk about our reactions to the readings. I wish I had realized this fact earlier on, and learned to treat the class more like the survey course it is. Overall, I'd recommend taking the class, but it's not a must–take as the other comments will make it sound. (If you take any other ethnic studies/womgen class you'll probably encounter the most important readings, and TBH as I stated earlier, you'll probably get the same result from taking the class as taking the syllabus and just doing the readings on your own.) No complaints at all on the teaching staff though! They are an awesome team (I loved the weeks that the TFs led their own lectures on their research interests), but I will say the class will be influenced heavily by the demographic of the students/the ones in your section.",0.9926,,0.0,,0.0
