Such an amazing course, the assignments are all super fun and not too difficult, and Professor Hartmann is so friendly and accessible. There are a lot of diverse components to the grading (participation, group quizzes, one exam, papers, video project, in\u2013class debate, etc.) so you never have to stress about any one assignment. The class has a pretty hefty collaborative component (weekly quizzes with a group of ~5 people + peer editing, debates, and mini projects with that same group), which I found very fun and engaging but might not be for everyone if you don't like group work. Note that this class is very much \"you get out what you put it\" \u2013 can totally be a gem if you want to put in minimal effort, but if you engage with the material and your group members, you'll have a much more enriching (and fun) experience. Overall 10\/10 you should take this course. Genuinely enjoyed going to class for every lecture.","workload_score_mean":2.66,"best_gem_comment_short":"Note that this class is very much \"you get out what you put it\" \u2013 can totally be a gem if you want to put in minimal effort, but if you engage with the material and your group members, you'll have a much more enriching (and fun) experience.","course_id":"217833","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=5c830ad9d20af17ef52400c8a67b7f1feab3909a60af644518c60fabf68c97bd3e09c8a583077aa6db0cb00ae5534a16&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
