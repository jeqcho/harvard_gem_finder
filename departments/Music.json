It is truly a gem... in so many ways! When else can you learn how to appreciate the different parts of opera and the history of opera? It truly is not as intimidating as it looks, and the course is designed to be very welcoming and approachable from all fields. You definitely don't have to be involved in music to any extent to take this course, but it does help to have some background if you can. This is one of the most unique courses I have taken here at Harvard... with the BEST in the field (Professor Abbate!)","workload_score_mean":2.97,"best_gem_comment_short":"It is truly a gem... in so many ways!","course_id":"204418","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=976b512dc8ba43e7c7ba6688de7c60c3e1eafb86a263f7dc1c90a8a9de823cd27462ddf99c5a9dda04ab8c3c510e5021&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
