Absolutely loved this class, definitely one of my favorites. There are only 4 essays and a final paper, around 12\u201315 days given in between each assignment. The lectures are great, slightly difficult to follow with no background in game theory or any theoretics in Calculus. Professor Hummel is a great professor and is always available and helpful during office hours. No exams\/psets which was definitely a course strength.","workload_score_mean":3.52,"best_gem_comment_short":"Gem!","course_id":"216089","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpvf-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=7d1a6c730ad3dd189fcd1f87e50f88b53056b53932bbd25b82f2c6ab3926fea3c21086694f2de1c65c50671b4bbda08e&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"GOV 30","useful_title":"American Government A New Perspective","course_score_mean":4.02,"rec_score_mean":3.9,"gem_probability_mean":0.04,"sentiment_score_median":0.6797,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":4.71,"best_gem_comment_short":"","course_id":"111813","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpvf-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=bb60d74ce7e2568776889b7642905ea00c8584ac47197d5554d91b9d07d5c493cc7a45c8bf637a7b5fb932cc78e728c4&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"GOV 50","useful_title":"Data Science for the Social Sciences","course_score_mean":4.27,"rec_score_mean":4.26,"gem_probability_mean":0.02,"sentiment_score_median":0.85865,"best_gem_comment":"INCREDIBLE! I absolutely loved this course. Not so much because of the content (it was a requirement for me) but more so because it was the first class at Harvard other than Ec50 where I felt like the organization and motivation of every single part of the course was intentional and well\u2013crafted. I never felt like it was wasting my time or like it was busy work. Every single thing (except for section) in the course and on the website served a purpose and it did so very well. I can also not say enough nice things about Matt Blackwell. He is a Harvard GEM and we need to protect him at all costs. He cares SO much and it shows so deeply and I am so glad I had him as a professor. I'm worried how the course might change without him next year, but I hope not too much.","workload_score_mean":5.65,"best_gem_comment_short":"He is a Harvard GEM and we need to protect him at all costs.","course_id":"115859","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpvf-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=c2a1bb79f80812711c4f342f469607c18da8ffadfd25b451ac427f5f4bb1751f367d79746f0c2de63baa95cec6a2b55c&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"GOV 1249","useful_title":"Authoritarianism","course_score_mean":4.27,"rec_score_mean":4.23,"gem_probability_mean":0.0185185185,"sentiment_score_median":0.7784,"best_gem_comment":"The class is fantastic! Professor Hummel's lectures are outstanding, the TF's are great, and the assignments are all manageable given that one finds a strategic case study that can answer many of theories presented in lecture.
