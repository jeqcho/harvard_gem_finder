By far one of my favorite courses I have taken at Harvard. While this is a gem in terms of content and fun working with microscopes, you do need to go to lecture and engage with the content as the optics part can be challenging. Also the grading is a bit lagged so you have to really be on top of your grades to make sure you are not failing!","workload_score_mean":5.76,"best_gem_comment_short":"While this is a gem in terms of content and fun working with microscopes, you do need to go to lecture and engage with the content as the optics part can be challenging.","course_id":"109851","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=ee02b250ae04106836cd66eaa3c39a4407876ecf279bfedc63b007b1442892ad9404c865141bc58633d5ff038a29ebc1&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"MCB 105","useful_title":"Systems Neuroscience","course_score_mean":3.81,"rec_score_mean":3.97,"gem_probability_mean":0.0555555556,"sentiment_score_median":0.87565,"best_gem_comment":"TAKE THIS CLASS.
