The professor is so sweet and the TFs are amazing. Also there are a lot of tastings in this class so if you like chocolate that's a great bonus. Even though there are two quizzes, there are both take home and doable if you pay attention in section. You don't have to do all the readings to do well, but make sure to participate in section as much as you can. Honestly this is one of those courses where the TF you get determines whether it's a \"gem\" or not. But overall, great class, nice teaching staff and interesting topic.
