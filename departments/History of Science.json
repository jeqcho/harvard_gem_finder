There is so much valuable information to grasp from the readings, and the discussions that you get to have with your peers are priceless. Les is such an amazing instructor and is really what made this course a gem. You are essentially given full creative freedom for the final project, and it is such an enriching experience to work under his guidance. Take advantage of office hours because he will open doors to new ways of approaching your idea that you'd never even considered before. The readings are not only interesting, but the load is very manageable as well and it would only take you a couple of hours of focus per week to be able to make the best of class time. If you are a student like me who is also interested in pursuing medicine, I feel that this class was essential to my understanding of how the foundation of medicine was developed, and think that any good doctor should know this history. This discussion style course was 3 hours, but I swear it always passed so fast because of how engaging the discussion and class activities are. 10\/10 I could not recommend it more :)","workload_score_mean":5.33,"best_gem_comment_short":"Les is such an amazing instructor and is really what made this course a gem.","course_id":"223101","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=aa11ed091f364f18ef6d5e3af21b8ffdddfeaed0b46e1ffe161f6d7bbed672a72c9028c8d1e03f4d7a319cbd7d125e6e&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
