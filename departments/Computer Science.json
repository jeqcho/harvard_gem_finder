The video project is graded in a very biased and unsatisfactory way. I effectively submitted 3 times (and put a good amount of work into it) just to be told \"pretty good, here's an A\u2013\". it makes no sense. good luck arguing with the course heads as well because they're very self\u2013righteous in their grading and don't pay attention to what you have to say. Overall, very subjective grading that will most likely result in an A\u2013. If you're okay with that, then by all means take the course, it will be the easiest one in your semester... just don't expect an A.","workload_score_mean":3.94,"best_gem_comment_short":"While this class is a gem for workload, unless you're comfortable taking it and getting an A\u2013, don't take it.","course_id":"204964","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=552b21f641a1c9901b7b344a5235249d0a9979ab74beef8f669b7c4871230d970d49495972d50503b1138672f6a5408e&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"COMPSCI 32","useful_title":"Section ","course_score_mean":4.34,"rec_score_mean":4.34,"gem_score_mean":0.012345679,"sentiment_score_median":0.8793,"best_gem_comment":"This class is very manageable. the lectures are effective, and you learn a lot by the end!
