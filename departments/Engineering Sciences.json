Michael is a very enthusiastic, though disorganized, professor, and he will go through various theories and models that are surprisingly applicable to the real world. Furthermore, the teaching staff behind him were a pleasure also, especially Francesco. As an in\u2013season athlete, the workload of the class was barely manageable alongside my 3 other PSET classes but for sure doable with 1 other PSET classes. I would argue it might be a little bit of a hidden gem given how much support is given in the course to help you succeed in the class. Even when you had projects or PSETs, the work actually required to complete them can be very reasonable for a good grade!","workload_score_mean":6.79,"best_gem_comment_short":"I would argue it might be a little bit of a hidden gem given how much support is given in the course to help you succeed in the class.","course_id":"156427","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=bb494355949a3b2d5da8e95e29d56c80333cf56a5d606349a36ce71b307ccd4dd48d9fca84e01f99ca85a8e7a17751e9&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
