It is up to you how much you prepare for it.In hindsight, I think I should focus less on the material and on crafting the topic, but instead focusing on delivery and speech techniques. Start practicing the speech instead of keep editing your draft or slides: your end goal is to improve your public speaking anyways!I won't say it is a gem, because you meet 2 hours per class, 2 classes per week, so that is already 4 hours per week (outside of prep time). It might take time to craft the speech, and also there was a week with >100 pages of reading. However, grading is very low stress, so just put in as much as you want to get out of it.A strength of the course is that the class bonds quite tightly, so you get to know a certain selection of Harvard people that perhaps you might not necessarily come across. However, most of them will be seniors, so you might not meet them again. Regardless, it is very cool to get to know them deeply and listen to their speeches. Some speeches are really impressive that you will learn and perhaps incorporate some of their style in your speech. There are also speeches that can broaden your world view. Some are hilarious to sit through.There are some fun warm\u2013up exercises reminiscent of summer camp activities like throwing small sandbags while walking in a circle and shouting out the alphabets. You don't get to do this in most other classes.The idea of our speeches being recorded and we get to privately review them afterwards is also pretty powerful.Take it! It is a fun class that really bonds and also a chance for you to develop your public speaking skills! You will get to see and learn quite a lot.","workload_score_mean":4.08,"best_gem_comment_short":"Start practicing the speech instead of keep editing your draft or slides: your end goal is to improve your public speaking anyways!I won't say it is a gem, because you meet 2 hours per class, 2 classes per week, so that is already 4 hours per week (outside of prep time).","course_id":"125227","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=128b1b65420d5fca9f3e96ea8d7363bd1182723e931724b0341e002e8ac92ae8c39141596b9422f36f0ffe755b824ca2&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"EXPOS 20","useful_title":"Expository Writing 20 213","course_score_mean":4.58,"rec_score_mean":4.5,"gem_probability_mean":0.1,"sentiment_score_median":0.9204,"best_gem_comment":"I really loved the content of this specific Expos class, and it made me lean toward choosing Art History as a part of my education.
