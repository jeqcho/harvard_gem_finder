As a STEM major, this was my favorite class this semester. The support you will get in this class is incredible, the sections are extremely useful, and the workload is relatively easy to manage. You will learn a lot and will actually be able to apply said knowledge in the final projects! A very fun class and a great experience :) The assignments and exams are very straight forward and you will get lots of support, especially in OH and sections. The teaching staff is great and will promptly answer any concern you might have. In my time at Harvard, I have never seen a more dedicated teaching team than the one in Ling 83.","workload_score_mean":2.98,"best_gem_comment_short":"A GEM!","course_id":"122514","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=5e2e8d8192291f6a3e88039df137672062589f26a1ec4acb9097714a802b5a55be8bcc1dfb16f9f165e745e458d9b913&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
