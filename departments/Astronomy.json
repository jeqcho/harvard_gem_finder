A TOTAL GEM! All of the readings and discussions are super interesting, the Professor is incredibly passionate and the simulations are genuinely fun. This class is also incredibly easy: perfect for any humanities kid trying to fulfill their divisional distribution requirements! The assignments are all very interesting and are really what you make of them: they can feel like busy work, but also have the potential to be super fun if you really invest yourself (depending on what you want out of the course.) NO PSETS, NO TESTS. You literally never have to take notes or remember a single thing from this course. Professor Sonnert is crazy smart and clearly very passionate, but also incredibly kind and sentimental. What a great guy. Super chill class. 10\/10 would recommend.","workload_score_mean":2.74,"best_gem_comment_short":"A TOTAL GEM!","course_id":"205519","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=d040543832a9e291d25c3aa1109cfd17602f32c4a8b5ddff34639f27d99cb2aa4244cddfc15ff207e154adcbe6833eac&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
