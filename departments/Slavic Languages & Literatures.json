It is truly a GEM because of how accessible Dr. Kremer makes all the material. Even if you have no background in Polish history all the readings are understandable and fascinating. You walk away from this class with an immense amount of knowledge on how a country could undergo so many changes in such a short period of time. Class meets only once a week but the discussions that we have are so enriching because you get to see how everyone interprets such dense material through multifaceted perspectives. The assignments are also manageable and fun because they challenge you to write about difficult topics at times. Visit Dr. Kremer's office hours and take her other courses as well!!!!","workload_score_mean":4.8,"best_gem_comment_short":"It is truly a GEM because of how accessible Dr. Kremer makes all the material.","course_id":"205086","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpvf-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=3031aee602ebc2ae1c6f9ad9fb9191771712a0b24382215a2d030645f7ddb29c0a1d7441fc403e5719854b99c4ca1c0c&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
