This was my favorite class this semester \u2013\u2013 the lectures are so interesting (Professor Lunbeck is a great lecturer!) and the papers are short and actually fun to do. Section discussions are engaging and fun and I looked forward to them. The ratio of learning and enjoyment to work in this class is amazing and I would probably call it a gem. The instructors and teaching staff are also so kind and understanding and overall this class is just a pleasure to be in!

SUPER MEGA CHILL GEM AND YOU WILL LEARN SO MUCH JUST BY LISTENING IN LECTURE. You do not have to prepare before class and there are no exams. Just 3 easy and actually engaging assignments. One short policy brief, another 4\u20135 page policy brief, and final project (which you could also just do another 5 page policy brief). You do not need any prior knowledge and the professor is sooooo good and knowledgeable and she will always fully prepare you for all assignments. The rubrics are super clear so you just have to make sure to touch every point and there is so much support if you ever want to talk through your ideas. I would always look forward to going to lecture and it was one of my favorite classes this semester because it did not require a lot of time but I was constantly learning and gaining knowledge about global health. Highly recommend to anyone who needs to satisfy GenEd requirement of GHHP requirement.
