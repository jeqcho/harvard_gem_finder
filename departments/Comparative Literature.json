It is a true gem in the comparative literature department, as is Professor Lienau! The professor is a brilliant and knowledgeable literary scholar, an incredible resource, and an eloquent educator. I was constantly learning new words in her class. It was inspiring to realize the continuities across regions and to learn about our oft\u2013forgotten history. For example, themes of grief, loss of nation, class distinction, gender roles, etc.. were truly inspiring to me as a literary scholar. It's a true survey class, so the expectations are not too high while the support is generous from the professor. You will learn so so much, and I really enjoyed the work I produced in the class. It was great that we had a diversity of classmates as well, although I must say the most profound observations were made from the professor herself. It's not a must\u2013take class by any means, but a very strong one to add to your schedule, especially if you have a passion for literature and SEA as I do.","workload_score_mean":4.71,"best_gem_comment_short":"It is a true gem in the comparative literature department, as is Professor Lienau!","course_id":"222897","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=218b436bbc946958cb996e99be7d188dac6fb5c75872c717867377f668881dbac41fb182f8014b796e62a4092cba0e8c&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
