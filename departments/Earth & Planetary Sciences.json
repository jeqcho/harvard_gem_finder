If you have Python experience the class is manageable, but will require going to office hours. The TFs are very helpful and often you could complete the whole weekly coding notebook in 1 hour in office hours. You also can complete more than 50% of notebook in class, reducing homework. The 3 hour class is a little long, but the coding and breaks make it manageable. I'd take the class and recommend it, but don't expect it to be a complete gem. But, if you like coding and don't mind a longer class and can go to office hours or spend some time attempting to read the Professor's mind, this is a good class for you.","workload_score_mean":4.96,"best_gem_comment_short":"I'd take the class and recommend it, but don't expect it to be a complete gem.","course_id":"214499","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=679c6ae99d9dbd6efd63f4fc9b94cababf98ad8cb2e8b6f95fccec9771db233601fe0989708ff543669d0c433c554acd&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
