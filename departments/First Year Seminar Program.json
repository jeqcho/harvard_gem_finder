As far as first year seminars go, this has got to be up there with the best of them. Ann does a great job at teaching about food, a key topic in today's world, from a scientific lens, in a stress\u2013free way that is understandable. The course really challenges you to think of food holistically and from many schools of thought that value science as the key player.  The assignments are fun and relaxed, and the final group project (building an operational farm) was definitely a highlight of my semester.  The small class also allows you to meet some great people with similar interests.
