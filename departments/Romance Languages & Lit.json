You will be introduced to so much more than just the language, and you can go as far as you'd like with it. Marcia is a FANTASTIC professor that is so passionate about Brazilian culture, it makes this class worth its M\u2013Th 9am time slot. BEWARE, however, there is a new professor coming in Spring 2024 that may or may not change your opinion of the course. Although, I've heard that the new prof is using the same course materials Marcia has been using, so it may not be that drastic of a change. If you're even slightly considering the course for your language req, which you probably are since you're reading this, TAKE IT. No regrets. This class has motivated me to go as far as getting my language citation in Portuguese :)","workload_score_mean":4.13,"best_gem_comment_short":"The Portuguese department and community at Harvard is a hidden gem, truly.","course_id":"120398","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpvf-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=964f5c4baedc8f233df5dc5eebd10645422a188b90dff314ea5a30e53c5d10f2a2fec7a30b6863d28fe1e8c97031529f&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
