Dr. Brisson is an absolute gem, the sweetest lady, and very understanding and flexible if you need extensions on homework, projects, etc. The course load is not bad at all, and the final project (where you create a short French film in groups) is relatively low\u2013pressure and super fun and creative. You\u2019ll learn loads about Francophone cinema from a range of really interesting movies, which is not only a fun homework but also teaches you so much about Francophone culture \u2013 it\u2019s really interesting.
