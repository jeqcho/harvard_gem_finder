Pearls fall out of his mouth. I took this class as a senior who just wanted to read books again and this hit the spot. The assignments are reasonable in terms of volume and intensity and feedback is fair. You could get by if you really wanted to if you didn't read the books, but this is a class where you get out what you put in\u2013the syllabus is incredible.
