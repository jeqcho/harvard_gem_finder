Regardless of your own academic trajectory,  the readings and discussions in this course will be relevant to your work and complicate/enrich your approach to your own study. At times, the course felt like a survey course—taking on themes of gender, urbanism, migration, and environmental change one at a time. On a weekly basis, this course does not demand a lot of work as there are usually only a couple of short–medium journal articles/book chapters to read. Discussion posts are flexible and generative and assignments are not overly long. While I am glad I took this course, I would have a couple of reservations in recommending this class to peers. First, the Professor has a habit of jumping into discussions so frequently that students became hesitant to speak. At times, discussions felt stifled by this dynamic and seemed to drag on despite the general interest in the topics being discussed. Changes to discussion formatting could improve this and it certainly wasn't a deal breaker. Additionally, assignment feedback was pretty minimal and if you are looking for a class to dramatically improve your academic writing, this likely would not be it. That being said, this class really could be whatever you make it—ample opportunities for presentations, wide open essay prompts, and an open ended final all make it an ideal class to adapt to your own academic needs.",0.9674,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

This has been the worst class experience I’ve ever had, and that’s saying a lot as an engineering student. The only thing I could count on being consistent was the extreme delay in grades and my frustration with the course.	To start things off, Robert created a new grading system that gets rid of the usual numbers and replaces them with N, L, R–, R, and R+. While this didn’t really affect me that much as a student, it was super inconvenient to understand how I was doing academically in the class. From the first day, we asked Robert to release the grade conversion table (that he claims to have had) so we could better understand if we would end up with a good grade in the end or not. Week after week, Robert wouldn’t release the conversion table even as we continued to ask him. Even as I sit here writing this on May 15th, I still don’t have a conversion table other than Robert saying that R’s would correspond to A’s. 	To add to this confusion, the grading in this class was super inconsistent. Robert told us that if we got an R on every question of a problem set except for one R– that the entire problem set would receive an overall grade of an R–. Basically, you can do really well on every problem except one and that one problem would determine your overall assignment grade. This, however, was not the case throughout the semester. There were multiple instances where I would receive the exact same subscores as one of my peers but they would receive an overall grade that was one grade lower than mine (e.g. I would get an R and they would get an R–). There were also instances where points were deducted for a question that wasn’t even asked (e.g. “didn’t answer why ____” when that question wasn’t even asked of us). Our problem sets were originally due weekly on Wednesdays, but very early in the semester this day started changing. It originally was delayed to Thursday because the previous problem set was not released on time. Then the date moved to Friday because of the same issue. There was even a time when a problem set was due on a Sunday because it wasn’t ready for release yet. Problem sets 5 and 6 were combined to help get us back on track, but it was one of the most stressful weeks for me to get it done.With these changing deadlines, the office hours schedule remained the same, however. As someone who relied heavily on office hours just to comprehend what the problem sets were asking me to solve, these changing deadlines created a lot of unneeded stress. I could only attend office hours on Tuesdays (one in the afternoon and one in the evening), so this meant that I worked on the problem sets at the end of the week and over the weekend (or whenever they were released). When problem sets were released on Sundays or Mondays, I was left cramming in the assignment on my very busy Mondays to try and make a dent before office hours. And it’s not like I was a procrastinator; the problem sets would take hours to complete because they were so long and very hard to understand most of the time. On weeks where we would only have 5 days instead of 7 to work on a problem set because of a late release, Robert would shorten the problem set by a problem or two. However, the problem sets were still extremely long and very stressful to complete with the shorter timeline.To add to this growing frustration, there were multiple instances where Gradescope assignments weren’t created until the day before the assignment was due. This meant that even if we finished our problem sets early, we had to wait around for the submission to be opened. This led to a great deal of confusion and stress since we as students maintain very meticulous schedules that shouldn’t revolve around Gradescope submissions being opened so we can finally submit homework and cross it off our to–do list. When our check–ins moved online, this same issue occurred but was more impactful since we were supposed to turn in our quizzes within 30 minutes of the Canvas quiz closing. You can’t turn in a quiz on Gradescope if no assignment exists. It’s as simple as that.Not only would Gradescope assignments not be open for submission, Robert would often release check–ins multiple days late. The way that check–ins 3–5 worked (we were supposed to have 6 check–ins total actually, but Robert was so behind by the end of the semester that we only did 5) was that they were taken asynchronously within a 5 day window. This window was usually Friday–Wednesday. However, there were multiple instances where Robert wouldn’t release the quiz until Sunday or even Monday. This led to many students blocking time out of their schedules on Fridays or Saturday mornings to take a quiz that wasn’t available to be completed. They then had to rearrange their schedule in the days that followed to accommodate this quiz that they should have been able to take when Robert said it would be released.Let’s talk about how we communicated with the teaching staff. Robert chose to use Ed as the main platform of communication, but this was such a mistake. Not only is Ed just an unnecessary platform to use when most classes already use Slack, but Robert and the rest of the teaching staff (except for our Queen Annabelle) wouldn’t answer important questions. Granted, if someone had a question about the wording on a problem set, Robert was decently quick to respond. But heaven forbid someone asked when we were going to get grades back. By the last day of the semester, there were sooooo many unanswered posts on Ed regarding revisions, grading, and end–of–semester plans. Since we couldn’t get answers on Ed, we had to resort to using class time to ask questions that Robert would refuse to answer on Ed. There was an instance in one of the last weeks of class where I asked a question that spiraled into other students asking questions and providing suggestions for 20 minutes straight. This essentially ended with Robert saying that he had made many compromises already (e.g. one less quiz, one less homework assignment, etc) and that he couldn’t just cancel the last quiz. Keep in mind that this is the same time that we all had final projects for other classes that we already budgeted time for. I have to say that a lack of planning does not constitute a compromise on Robert’s part; he made many decisions and would refuse to let go of his original vision of the class that led to us, the students, having to make many compromises just to finish the class. We had to compromise our time and sanity just to get our assignments done.Now to talk about lectures. I can’t for the life of me understand why we spent the first 20–30 minutes of class recapping what we learned the previous class. This was a waste of time and meant that I mentally checked out during class right at the beginning. I also don’t understand why lectures couldn’t be recorded or why lecture notes (or even lecture topics) weren’t posted. There were many days where I was not feeling well (both physically and mentally) but I knew I couldn’t miss class because I would end up behind in the content and would be lost on the problem set. I don’t see how this was the standard for a class where the professor called quizzes low–stake opportunities to check in with our learning.",-0.9976,,0.0,143432,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Applied Mathematics,Applied Mathematics,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Section

I learned so much in it, I will remember it forever (and for what it's worth, it's also quite gemmy). Would also flag that the more you put into it, the more you will get out of it. You don't have to show up to every lecture or read every book, but if you do, you will learn so much more. Ultimately, though, this course is its professor, not its assignments or materials. In that sense, the weaknesses of the course are also its strengths, I think. Prof Stilgoe is SO smart & provocative & at times quite headstrong in a way that really makes you challenge your thinking but also at times can feel like he is being provocative for the sake of being provocative. There's nothing wrong with this because it forces you to think more deeply, but when it intersects with questions of identity/diverse perspectives, it can feel problematic. (For example, him facetiously taking on a sexist or racist perspective in order to make a point about gender or race. He's being facetious, but to be the minority in the room bearing the brunt of that rhetorical point can feel burdensome and deeply frustrating.)At the same time, I think sometimes when I learned the most it was because I had to recognize how genuinely pissed off he was making me and then ask why. I guess bottom line is that this won't be an easy class emotionally/psychologically (especially if you're a woman, which I was) but you will learn more than you'll learn in most other Harvard classes. And it will be a fairly easy one in terms of assignments — he doesn't ask a lot.I would say take it but take it with a grain of salt!!

As for the class lectures, I personally did not feel like I gained a deep understanding of tissue engineering. Lectures sometimes felt dry and only briefly covered various aspects of the field without going into depth into any of them. However, I did enjoy the weekly journal club assignments, since they forced us to not just read landmark papers in the field but also think critically about them. Professor Mooney also really cares about the class and takes student feedback into account.I will say that the lab was definitely the highlight of this class: Melissa and Avery really want you to succeed and create an environment where you feel safe asking questions and learning important/employable wet lab skills. If you have limited wet lab experience, I highly recommend doing the lab — you learn the very basics (filtering media, culturing/passaging cells) as well as more advanced techniques (3D cell culture and modeling angiogenesis). Melissa and Avery also mentor you one–on–one every week throughout the entire scientific process, from developing a good scientific question/hypothesis to running your experiments to analyzing your data. Be prepared to spend up to 10 hours in the lab each week if you really want to get the most out of this class, but it's a rewarding experience like no other!",0.9899,"Easier than other classes in SEAS if you are required to take them, but you won't learn much and will spend some time doing busywork.

The class readings and discussions were some of the most fascinating and thought–provoking of my college career.Additionally, Professor Sumner is without a doubt one of most remarkable scholars and teachers I've ever worked with. She cares so deeply about her students and about the subject matter.  She is also one of (if the *the*) foremost experts in her field within Celtic Studies—learning from someone like her is one of those ""only at Harvard"" opportunities. This course reminded me why I love learning so much.I would recommend that you take advantage of all the resources and opportunities that come with this class. Go to office hours. Read some of the optional readings. Chat with the grad students. Participate in class. Engage deeply and critically with the course material. You will take so much away from this course (and have so much fun) if you really dive into the readings and stay curious.I truly believe every individual would be better off for taking this class and for learning from someone like Professor Sumner. I think our world would be better off if our future leaders took part in a course like this. I wholeheartedly recommend Celtic 106 to any and all prospective enrollees—you will not regret it. You will become a better student, thinker, and person. You will engage with absolutely fascinating material and learn from one of the best (in every sense of the word) professors at this institution.

That said, I would recommend it with reservations. Here is everything you need to know:First, what should you take, Chem 17 or Chem 20? Chem 20 is definitely a harder course based on looking at the Chem 17 problem sets and exams and talking to many people taking Chem 17. One main difference between the courses is that Chem 20 teaches organic synthesis, which is a pretty challenging skill. For context, most people I know didn’t get a single synthesis problem on the exams fully right until the way end of the semester. That said, once you get the hang of synthesis, it is much more enjoyable than arrow–pushing mechanisms, which is the focus of Chem 17/27. Another major difference is that Chem 20 has lab while Chem 17 does not. The lab was probably my least favorite part of Chem 20 just because it is so long (4 hours at night) and very tedious, but you have to do lab in Chem 27 anyway, so lab should not be a reason to avoid Chem 20. A third major difference is that the problem sets in Chem 17 are pass/fail, while the problem sets in Chem 20 are not. That said, there are so many bonus points on problem sets in Chem 20 that you can easily get 100% if you put in the work. Most people I know got 100% in the problem set portion of the grade, so don’t worry about this portion of the course. A fourth major difference is the vibe of the course. The TFs, PSLs, and lead instructor of Chem 20 are way more supportive than in Chem 17 based on what I have heard. Everyone wants you to succeed and will help you as much as you want, which makes a challenging subject like Organic Chemistry much more enjoyable. Fifth, the exams in Chem 20 are apparently much more fair than in Chem 17. Don’t get me wrong, you have to spend a LOT of time studying, but putting in the work will pay off, which is really rewarding. I have not heard the same thing about the Chem 17 exams, which are apparently are intended to trick you. Finally, the grading curve in Chem 20 is slightly better than Chem 17, but both grading curves are not particularly generous. A big difference, though, is that in Chem 20 the grading curve is fixed at the start of the semester, while the Chem 17 grading curve changes depending on how students are doing. As a result, Chem 17 is much more competitive because you are competing against your classmates. Just for reference, in spring 2023, you needed a 90 to get in A in Chem 20 and an 85 to get an A–.To succeed in Chem 20, here is my advice. First, stay on top of the content as it is taught. This class moves really fast and it is cumulative, so do the purple book practice problems for each week’s module. YOU WON’T HAVE TIME TO LEARN ALL OF THE REQUIRED MATERIAL THE WEEK BEFORE THE TEST. Each exam is cumulative, so make sure you stay on top of the previous units as well. Second, go to office hours/helproom to work on the problem set. While there, really focus not just on the answers but on learning the material. The main factor that determines your grade in chem 20 is the exams, so treat the problem sets as a learning experience, not as required assignments that matter a lot on their own. The TFs are fantastic, so don’t be afraid to ask them questions. Third, start studying for the exams a least a week in advance. Often, you will not realize just how much material has been covered until you sit down and start working through practice problems. The exams are pretty challenging, but for the most part are fair. Make sure to study the stuff you think you are not as good at, even if you don’t think it's gonna show up on the test (because it probably will). Fourth, GO TO ALL OF THE LECTURES! Unlike LS1a and other intro classes, the lectures are not required/there are no poll questions to assess participation. But, that's because the instructors know they don’t need to require people to come since the lectures are useful on their own. If you don’t come to lecture, you will be in big trouble for the exams. Fifth, don’t feel obligated to go to section every week since they are optional. Also, if other TFs are better, just go to their section instead of your own. Use section to help YOU; I often didn’t go and still got an A in the class. Finally, Orgo lab is not fun, but it won’t matter much for your grade, so just try your best and it will be fine, even if it doesn’t feel that way when going through the class. Good luck!",0.9968,"Chem 20 is an excellent introduction to organic chemistry, and it is great for anyone looking to gain some chemical intuition! The lectures are very well structured and organized, and the course flows pretty logically from one topic to another. From my perspective now after taking the course, I believe that I not only learned many common reactions in organic chemistry, but I also learned many fundamental principles underlying organic chemistry that are more broadly applicable. Do be warned – this course is very time–consuming! Between the million practice problems, problem sets, 3 exams, and lab (4 hours every other week + lab reports!), this class is quite the time sink! If you have other demanding classes in your schedule, you will definitely have to carefully manage your time so you can finish your assignments (and eat and sleep). I believe the time commitment is worth it, but you will need to make your decision based on your schedule.Course logistics/advice: in my experience, you learn about 60% of the material needed for psets/exams in the lectures, and the other 40% you learn from the Aktiv chemistry problems (quick conceptual quizzes), the practice problem book, and the psets. Although the practice problems are technically optional, it is very very highly recommended to do the problems because there are a few advanced applications or exceptions to the rules you learn in class that are covered in them (which is a little frustrating but since chemistry is very much learned through practice and pattern recognition, it is necessary to do practice problems anyway). Start early on the psets and go to office hours early in the week – it will save you the stress of being in office hours for hours the day it is due (speaking from personal experience lol). Also, start studying for the exams early and try to stick with Amy's study plan as close as you can – I crammed for the last two midterms did okay, but then I followed her plan more closely for the final and did much better!",-0.5761,,0.0,124312,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Chemistry & Chemical Biology,Chemistry,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Section

Many students asked several times for the lectures to be slowed down (since we would often end early), but little was done to slow down the course to a comprehensible level.

Dr. Philbrick is lovely and quite understanding, and the assignments that she created were interesting and engaging, beyond the weekly reading quizzes.

Let me explain. Yes, I loved this class but I think that its mediocre reputation is warranted. First of all, the class' name is misleading. Yes, the class does cover abstraction and design but that is not what the entire class is about. Instead, the class is a proper Programming 2 class. A more in–depth look at programming as a whole which includes abstraction and design. I would say the first 1/3 of the class is dedicated almost entirely to abstraction and design but after that, you go into topics that are certainly applicable to software engineering, but they are not solely  in the interest of teaching abstraction and design! Another thing that pains me (as well as most of my classmates) is the language that the class is taught in—Ocaml. Ocaml is seldom used in industry and the professor will spend the first lecture telling you that it does not matter what language the class is taught in because it's a class on abstraction and design and NOT a class on Ocaml. In my opinion, that claim is simply not true. Like I said, the class does cover design but it is by no means the main focus of the course. In addition, to say that the class is not a class on Ocaml feels a little disingenuous when a good chunk of the exams require knowledge of very specific and niche details about Ocaml and do not focus on design. Yeah, exams for a class that's on abstraction and design and NOT Ocaml focuses on Ocaml and not as much on abstraction and design... that's a little ridiculous. In addition, the class focuses way too much on ""semantics."" Semantics are basically the way the computer evaluates your code and its presence is pervasive in the final part of the course. It accounts for a considerable portion of the second midterm and is the sole focus of the final project. I mention this because while semantics can be useful in laying down the foundations for understanding how to program, I think it was overemphasized in this course and so did my classmates.Now, I have spent most of this review tearing CS51 apart and yet I claim that I loved the class. That is true, and it is because CS51 was almost exactly what I wanted—a deeper dive into programming. I only started programming last semester in CS50 and wanted to take another class dedicated solely to programming. So logically, I took CS51 and got just that, a comprehensive look at programming as a whole sprinkled in with a good chunk of abstraction and design. However, if you are looking for a class to fulfill the Programming 2 requirement, a class that will actually cover abstraction, design, and a useful language, then this is not the class for you. If those are your only motivations for taking this class then take CS61 instead. However, if you just want a class that will build off the programming knowledge from CS50, then feel free to take this class. CS51 is hard, but it is also fun if you take it for the right reasons.",0.9952,"I would not recommend taking this class if you are new to coding. The PSets are unbelievably obscure and have little to do with what you learn in class, the feedback is infrequent, and much of the class is much more difficult than it needs to be. I don't think that CS51 itself is hard, much of the concepts are reasonably simple to grasp, but the manner in which they are presented is often confusing. The course is difficult not to be challenging, but for difficulty's sake. If you want to do well in this class, you should be prepared to live CS51 rather than merely take it. This is not because it's hard, but because this class is frustrating without a cause. I ultimately think I learned very little, even as someone who had only ever coded in CS50 since most of our PSets were filled with skeleton code.",-0.854,,0.0,112960,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Computer Science,Computer Science,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Laboratory,Section 001

Lectures are not useful in any way, but the videos provided are. In most cases I would argue that the videos were more helpful than the textbook itself, but I would still look back on the figures and examples provided in the textbook. While some psets may be challenging, I found the readmes to be very helpful in figuring it out in certain cases. I would skip the background information and delve straight into what they want us to do for each problem as they sometimes give useful hints in there.

If you are a CS major and end up taking it just like everyone else, you will be fine but I hope this review helps you prepare for what’s to come! Not everyone might agree with my review as people from very very different backgrounds and with very different skills and preferences take the class. I’m writing from the perspective of someone who is usually average in CS classes and neither wanted to sacrifice the entire semester for this class (wanted to have time for fun and other stuff) nor is passionate about theoretical CS / research / really hard stuff. I took Math 22, Stat 110, CS50 + 51, and CS 120, which I think is good preparation for this course. As dramatic as the paragraphs below might sound, it’s still a doable class and we all struggle through it together, it just requires a lot of effort and pain so it’s good to know in advance and prepare for probably one of the hardest classes you’ll ever take!While at times interesting, this class will consume you and challenge you in ways you’ve probably never experienced or imagined. With unreasonably long problem sets due every week and exams designed by a sadist, it will be a nightmare from day 0. You will learn a lot but the cost is definitely high (unless you are really smart like a good amount of the kids in the class). I was basically taking 3 gems and this class so this was pretty much my only serious commitment for most weeks and it still was A LOT.

If you are a CS major and end up taking it just like everyone else, you will be fine but I hope this review helps you prepare for what’s to come! Not everyone might agree with my review as people from very very different backgrounds and with very different skills and preferences take the class. I’m writing from the perspective of someone who is usually average in CS classes and neither wanted to sacrifice the entire semester for this class (wanted to have time for fun and other stuff) nor is passionate about theoretical CS / research / really hard stuff. I took Math 22, Stat 110, CS50 + 51, and CS 120, which I think is good preparation for this course. As dramatic as the paragraphs below might sound, it’s still a doable class and we all struggle through it together, it just requires a lot of effort and pain so it’s good to know in advance and prepare for probably one of the hardest classes you’ll ever take!While at times interesting, this class will consume you and challenge you in ways you’ve probably never experienced or imagined. With unreasonably long problem sets due every week and exams designed by a sadist, it will be a nightmare from day 0. You will learn a lot but the cost is definitely high (unless you are really smart like a good amount of the kids in the class).

If you want a deeper understanding of ML (or any other area that uses optimization), this course is for you.However, I must note that the content sometimes felt unmotivated and dry.

I came from a software background and wanted to learn about the intersection between software and hardware, which is what I learned.  Here are a few takeaways I think will be helpful:– I don't think you need a prerequisite for this class, but CS 61 is super helpful in that it provides you with a solid high–level foundation of concepts that you'll be able to dive deeper into from a hardware perspective.  Some overlap includes caches and pipelines.  I really didn't understand them to how much I do now after taking CS 61.  Understanding the hardware is SO USEFUL.– You'll have PSETS and Labs.  PSETS take max 2 hours a week, and you have one per week.  I suggest checking with a group of people, makes it feel nicer.  Labs take a little longer because you have a week or two to do them, but you have a partner.  If you're a strong coder, it won't be anything difficult.  It's not a lot of hard debugging, more so understanding how to translate the concept into code.– The readings are ESSENTIAL.  Read the book!  Takes around 1 hour per reading.  Super helpful for when you go into lecture.– Attend Dhilan's section + office hours.  He was the GOAT of this class.",0.9884,"The material in the course itself is interesting, but the class feels so unstructured that it causes unnecessary amounts of stress. I'm not sure how helpful the lectures are for learning, since it just feels like they're really disorganized. The labs and the problem sets can be helpful in grasping the concepts, but the grading can seem nitpicky and unclear. It can also take up to two months to get feedback on assignments, so it can be really challenging to know how you're doing in the course.",-0.9324,,0.0,113856,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Computer Science,Computer Science,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Section

The problem sets are due like every week, but be warned, the software usd on them is either outdated or realllly esoteric. Like some of the pset questions will ask for you to use a really specific function of ns3 that has little documentation. The point is start early and clear those obstacles early. Perhaps most importantly CHOOSE YOUR PSET GROUP VERY CAREFULLY I got stuck with a deadbeet pset group for one of the psets and had to do the whole thing myself, and I heard many other similar stories.

I think society would be much better off if more people took this class. The group of students who take it is also wonderful and you learn a lot from your peers.

I think this is an excellent introduction, however, on how to use Chat GPT and tools in the digital humanities to build really cool projects that you can use to showcase on your resume as well!

Professor Abe is a wonderful teacher who cares deeply about and tries to get to know all his students. His lectures are great, and he is clearly very knowledgeable on the subject. The content itself is extremely interesting, and forces one to grapple with/question their understanding of the world if they don't have any prior exposure to Buddhist teachings. The way in which the class explores how Buddhist ideas manifest in Japanese arts (performing arts, visual arts, etc.) is fascinating, and afterwards you will almost surely start to notice how these ideas manifest in the types of media you consume. I also liked the structure of the lectures/content, where the introduction of different Buddhist schools was introduced alongside the types of art that are characteristic of them. The assignments are very fair and flexible: Professor Abe emphasizes that the final project is meant to be an enjoyable experience for you, and is very open to different kinds of academic or creative projects. The amount of reading is reasonable, but more importantly the readings themselves are interesting!I can't recommend this class enough, even if you haven't taken classes in the EAS department before – it is very accessible, so long as you keep an open mind and follow along with the class materials.",0.9696,,0.0,,0.0,218302,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,East Asian Langs & Civ,East Asian Studies,,Arts and Humanities,,Lecture,Section

The work load is super high (you will be doing 2 hours of homework every day) in addition to the class meeting every day, so I felt like I was mainly completing assignments but not actually improving my language skills that much. For example, we usually had to learn 80 Kanji compounds per lesson, so I would just memorize them for the test but forget most of them afterwards. The class would really benefit from a lower workload in favor of more in–depth review and speaking practice.

Exam questions are frustratingly subjective, but Professor Le Brun was always willing to try to understand different perspectives and would give back points on some questions (so make sure you always ask if you feel like your interpretation was valid)!

This might just be a personal thing, but I found macro way more interesting than micro, so even though 1010a was definitely easier than 1010b, I enjoyed 1010b so much more. A couple tips: the exams are very tricky, but are very manageable if you put in enough time. Take the time to review the lecture slides (like REALLY review the lecture slides), read the textbook, do the practice tests, review the psets, and you'll be fine. It can be super easy to fall behind in this class because lectures are recorded and psets aren't required, but don't let yourself fall behind!

I've never been in a more captivating lecturer with a professor who cares more about his students. Unfortunately shortly after the 1st midterm, Gabriel took over and that was tough... He's unfortunately not engaging at all and it became tough to come to class. In terms of the TFs – if Mike is teaching again you want him – he's the best, very funny, very knowledgeable and an amazing person, if Jake is still there – he's not as a good as Mike but is very sweet.In terms of the actual structure, weekly psets weren't too bad – needed more office hours on weekends though (watch out after the first half the problem sets switch from being due on Thursdays to being due on Tuesdays....). Sections are the best and really are a life saver. The exams themselves are very fair and doing the practice exam and review problems is all you need. The TFs go out of their way to do a 3 to 4h recorded zoom review session close to the exam and so lots of credit to them.

It is difficult but definitely not as difficult as everyone makes it out to seem. If you go to lecture, section, and office hours, you will actually succeed in this class. This is coming from someone who found all of the micro/macro classes here very hard. Unlike some of the other professors in the department, Bruich does NOT have it out for you—in contrast, he actually wants you to succeed. I mean, look at how cute this message was after the midterm, ""I try to be thoughtful in the grading of the exams, because that is what I would have wanted as a student.  To help ensure that you are assessed fairly and accurately, each question for all 180 students is graded by the same person.  We do the same for the final exam.  Overall, the class grades on a generous curve since the class is advanced and covers state of the art methods.  Typically, one can even be below the median overall and receive an A–.  We have important work ahead of us. There’s still a lot left, so there’s plenty of time to recover if you did not do as well as you would have liked.  Please keep working hard and focus on learning as much as possible together.   If you are having difficulties of any kind (health related or otherwise), please reach out to me.  I am willing and able to make accommodations.  I feel strongly that econometrics is something that you will use throughout the rest of your careers at Harvard and beyond.  Please do your very best to master metrics and let's do it together."" Like hello?? I've never gotten a message like that from any other econ professor here. I'm ngl, sometimes lecture is overwhelming/hard to follow, but if you come into the class realizing that you don't need to understand everything, your life will get so much easier. For me personally, I went to lecture to broadly orient myself on the topic we were learning, and I learned everything I needed to know in section. THIS MAKES IT IMPERATIVE THAT YOU PICK A CA THAT ACTUALLY KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING & HOW TO EXPLAIN THE CONTENT. I hated this course for the first 2 weeks because my CA was a grad student who just wasn't good at explaining anything. I changed my section to Gaby's and she honestly saved my econometrics experience. #queengabyIn terms of the exams, they are VERY fair. They're very similar to previous practice exams and the questions that are tested are not hard at all. The questions were majority ""interpret this coefficient"" and ""pick an omitted variable"" which we spend so much time doing. Trust, if you're on top of the class throughout the semester you will be fine 100%. The psets take a little bit of time but so long as you go to OH they're def manageable.

There really isn't any other class (from what I know) that teaches you how to actually conduct your own research, how to properly interpret your results, how to adequately convey the uncertainty regarding those results. This class is not super focused on coding (the teaching staff gives you sample code for every problem set and the exams don't entail any coding), but it's really hard to do well on the psets without having at least some familiarity with one of three coding languages (STATA, R, or Python).

There is a lot of content covered, so it does sometimes feel like a firehose of information, but that's the byproduct of really interesting course I think. Paper + final gets a bit tedious, but not unappreciative of it – it's definitely stretched me in a positive way. The TFs are very helpful and overall very approachable and supportive.

There were lots of cases where seemingly arbitrary numbers like 20 billion dollars to solve homelessness or 90 billion to solve all global health problems were thrown out with basically no concrete policies attached to what this money would do.  Lots of major world problems were presented, but few new or insightful ideas were presented on how to solve them.  Lectures and sections consisted of little new and concrete content and were mostly filled with people spitballing ideas about how to solve the major problems (and probably 99% of these ideas were either nonsense or were already being researched or implemented).  Matt got very sick over spring break and understandably needed some time to recover, but the course pretty much fell apart after the midterm: we learned probably 5–10 new concrete items between the midterm and the final.  The level of nonsense ideas allowed in class and section and the lack of concrete policies also contributed to a situation in which most people stopped reading the textbook because people could get 100s on all the assignments (even the midterm and final) by regurgitating a few buzzwords and writing long–winded vague opinion pieces.  This was a shame because the textbook and the associated journal articles were the only pieces of this course that actually had concrete, coherent explanations and policy proposals.All in all, if you're looking for an easy course, this is the class for you.  If you want to learn new concrete information about global health and be challenged and pushed in your thinking, this probably isn't the course for you.",-0.9383,"If this course is taught again, because I am not sure if it will be, TAKE THIS COURSE!!! The professor, Matt, truly cares about you as a person not just as a student. Many professors talk about the fact that they care about your mental health and wellbeing, but Matt truly means it. He is always willing to talk about the class during office hours or about anything. He is also just a very interesting guy. All of the grades have not come back yet (paper and final exam) but it is definitely a GEM of a Econ elective. Everything is low stakes and they are not trying to trick you – they want to see you just engage with the content of the course and if you put effort in, you will get an A. So if this class if offered again next year – TAKE IT!!! The downside was that it was taught at night from 8 – 10 pm, but that could change and he plays EDM music and DJs a little to help keep you engaged.

Really kind, someone who you can easily approach after class, and who’s interested in the work she does. But she is not a very good teacher. She is not an engaging lecturer and lacks command of the classroom, and runs through such a high volume of slides that it’s hard to see what is important. Lecture often feels like you’re just having facts listed at you without any real analysis or synthesis of what you should know.Here are the pros of 1661: the workload is light, the tests are easy (if you’re not a braindead ESPP/ec major), and the lecture notes are well organized so you can read through them quickly to pattern–match the answers to the psets when you inevitably stop going to lecture.In general, I had some other qualms with 1661. The class is designed essentially as an intro–level econ/ESPP class, so the economic theory discussed is very shallow and not that interesting. The first half of the class is focused on theory, of which there is probably 45 minutes total of valuable content, and the second half of the class goes through policy examples and case studies. 1661 is very much a survey class that covers a wide range of topics in environmental and energy economics, but at the end of the day does not leave you with the satisfaction of feeling like you can confidently understand any individual topic at a deep level. It’s not a bad class (since the workload/grading is quite nice), but it will not be a world–changing or particularly fulfilling experience. Go ahead and take it, but with very tempered expectations. (Assuming you have Dr. Mettetal.)",0.9936,"I am disappointed that I took this class the only semester when Stavins was not teaching it. After one guest lecture with him, I immediately could tell the difference between what should have been my experience in this class and what I ended up getting : dry lectures that were read off the screen and tfs who seemed just as confused as we were on the economic concepts with an inability to explain in a way that helped improve our understanding.",-0.6369,"This class has the potential to be great, I think under normal years when Professor Stavins is teaching it it would be way better than with Elizabeth Meatal. She moved way too fast and wasn't the best teacher where as the one lecture he came in for (he was on sabbatical) I felt like I learned so much more and he was way more engaging. The week to week coursework wasn't hard, and the class could've been gem–y if not for the midterm, which apparently was way harder then past years.",0.845,111261,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Economics,Economics,,Social Sciences,,Lecture,Section

I'd make sure that you can do every single PSET and group assignment inside and out –– they are often representative of the easier questions that you'll see on the exam so you for sure want to make sure that you can do them. The standard deviation on the exams are often quite large and this class is graded based on z–scores, so you want to make sure that you're performing pretty well and at least one standard deviation away from the mean to guarantee an A.

Practice exams are very very very representative of what you will be tested on –– so make sure that you can do them inside and out and if you don't understand something, for sure go to Professor Bergstresser's office hours to have him explain.Lastly, I will say that Professor Bergstresser is a very caring and kind professor and is very accessible outside of class.

The kids who had experience interning in finance and investment banking were at a significant advantage. Same with the kids who had taken some other sort of financial economics class. I also think that you would significantly benefit from the class if you were considering an Econ PhD down the road. The class definitely expects that you know a decent amount beforehand, like acronyms of random financial concepts, but you could always look these up or just ask the professor what they are. The class also has no textbook, so if you don't really understand lecture but want to grind the material at home, you'll really only have the lecture slides, which are kind of confusing when not paired with the lecture (and office hours, of course).That being said, if you're somewhat of an outsider to the field, you can still do well –– just expect an uphill battle and the frequent feeling that everyone somehow knows more than you. Professor Stein goes out of his way to make sure that you feel comfortable approaching the topic. He really likes it when you ask questions and in fact encourages it. He's a very kind and brilliant professor –– he memorized all of our first names –– and this course is one of a kind at Harvard. Even if you don't understand everything he says at first, the mere fact that you're hearing  from someone who served on the Fed Board of Governors has a great impact on your thinking in the long run. You'll get great insight into the decisions that policymakers and bankers face, and you'll get great exposure to contrasting economic ideas. Rather than just learning how to compute rote financial metrics,  you'll learn how to critically think about financial concepts and dynamics. I think that the type of thinking Stein teaches is not only valuable for those aiming to be leaders in the world of finance, but for anyone seeking to use analytical skills in decision–making roles.",0.9927,"I learned a shit ton from this course. After this class, I feel like I really actually for the first time understand how the financial system works and why it fails. It was also a crazy experience that I took this class while the regional banking crisis was happening and CS, SVB, FR and others failed. It felt like a textbook example of exactly what we had been talking about in class. Lectures were super interesting, but Stein prioritizes participation a lot, and I felt like often the same kids kept asking questions to the point where they were asking questions just to get participation points, and it made lectures annoying. Still, I never wanted to skip a single lecture. However, other than the lectures, the rest of the class isn't so great. Stein is hard to catch hold of. The TFs were not plugged in at all. Assignments were legit graded 2–3 months after submission and most of them were just binge graded during finals period. This means no feedback on lengthy papers that you had to write regularly. Overall, the resources were just terrible. Office hours were scarce and badly timed.

Lectures could be a little more engaging and have better flow but the class is super well–structured and is great at giving you a hands–on dive into mechanical engineering. Labs are super fun (unless you mess up and have to make–up the lab, happened to me once, wasn't too bad) and always felt extremely applicable to your project and the real–world. You'll end up doing a good amount of work, but the work is relatively easy. P–sets are pretty solidworks based, it would be useful to have some background in CAD but not necessary. Seymur and the TFs respond super quickly on slack and have always been super accessible. You can tell Seymur genuinely wants you to succeed and is a super sweet guy. I love how the class is very connected. The parts you make in your p–sets end up being used in lab which end up being used in your final project. Definitely take the time to bond with your project members (they're randomized) and set up time outside of class to work on your final project. As long as you turn everything you need to in, you'll get a good grade in the class.

It is an embarrassment to every other course at Harvard which have all been some of the best courses in that subject that I've ever taken. It is extremely clear how much of a problem that the engineering department is overseen by FAS and can't make its own decisions to cut the course into multiple classes. This course doesn't have enough office hours which is where all the learning is done and absolutely too much was thrown at Seymur Hasanov. Seymur is an absolute gem of an instructor that gave everything he had to this course after being set up to fail by not being able to structure the course to his liking after not being given enough time to remake the course in only 10 days. My only hope for this course is that Seymur will be here to stay and he'll have time to improve the course. This is not on him. This course needs a lot more TFs, it needs to be chopped down or separated into separate courses, and Seymur needs to be given time to set up the class. Right now it is so disorganized. It was extremely clear which assignments, problems, or lecture slides were layovers from previous years and which Seymur had the time to make his own. The quality difference was striking. The course he inherited is extremely poor. There are too many disjointed concepts, not enough support, and too much work. I thought of this class as 3 separate classes: the PSETs (mostly about solidworks that you had to teach yourself or live in Office Hours), the lab section (which was the best structured of the 3 but just a ton of work), and the lecture (which had nothing to do with the other too but had extremely tough concepts that the midterms would be about). Each of those 3 took more time than the rest of my classes combined. Also  the second half of the class takes a lot of physics that they expect you to know even though it's an intro class.

The lectures have improved somewhat, even with the many tangents Petros goes down, and the TFs are really quite helpful in making sure the concepts are clear. Most importantly, the grading policies have become much more lenient, with the course staff giving everyone a free 1–week extension on a problem set, one exam drop and one problem set drop, and all of these made the course a relatively low–stress experience. The content is also some of the most interesting in any engineering or physics course I've ever taken here and is super useful for a variety of disciplines (yes, even for bioengineers), and if you put in the time to pore over the lecture slides, stare at the equations until they make sense, and read over textbook examples to understand how to use the equations, you'll get a good feeling for just how elegant and conceptually simple yet powerful fluid mechanics is. The labs and final project in particular genuinely made me want to incorporate fluid mechanics into my future research because of how cool they were. That being said, most of this understanding came from me investing my own time to understand the material outside of class. The lectures move too quickly and have too many digressions to get a good grasp of the concepts in 75 minutes, and it certainly doesn't help that they're at 9am. Sections are often left to pick up the pieces and try to cover both concepts and problem–solving instead of just problem–solving as they should. While the problem sets were mostly painless, I really wished they covered more real–world situations so I felt better prepared for future work. Exams were of reasonable difficulty but far too long for anyone to complete in one class period. And while I appreciate them reducing the weekly labs down to 2 labs, I was left wanting much more computational fluid dynamics (CFD) experience to feel better prepared for industry and research, for which CFD experience is often critical.This is all to say that there's no need to worry much about doing well in the course anymore, and if you're willing to put in the extra time to really learn the material on your own it's intensely rewarding, but this course could be much better if the course staff took some time to organize the lectures more strictly and include more CFD practice.",0.9911,"I would not recommend this class if it is taught by Petros Koumoutsakos.

It is really a one–of–a–kind experience. The structure consists of one 2–hour lecture and one 4–hour lab each week. This lab time may sound long, but it is well worth it.  No background in microfabrication is assumed. I came in with some background in electrical engineering, which I think allowed me to better appreciate some of the topics we discussed, but this is still a VERY worthwhile class without such background.The amount you learn in this class is incredible, while still being a very reasonable choice workload–wise. You gain access to the cleanroom facilities at the Center for Nanoscale Systems (CNS), and will be trained extensively. Beginning with safety training and basic cleanroom orientation/wet bench training, you then do specialized training in a variety of techniques. As part of a 5–person lab group, everyone will specialize in different areas for training, but you will work together in very cool labs, gaining exposure and experience on all sorts of techniques. We focus on photolithography, chemical & physical vapor deposition, sputtering, reactive ion etching, test & measurement. This gives you a very solid foundation for future microfabrication work.The labs are super interesting. First, you fabricate a PN junction from scratch (a diode). This is one of the most basic semiconductor devices. The second lab is when you make LEDs – it's very satisfying to see them light up! Next is a photodetector (basically a solar cell), and finally, you will fabricate transistors. The focus of this course is on fabrication techniques, not the theory behind semiconductor devices. Some of these may seem like simple devices, but working through this course you really gain an appreciation for all of the care and attention to detail that goes into microfabrication – it's almost an art. You won't be making computer chips with thousands of transistors, but you will be fabricating as advanced devices as one possibly can with only one semester of training. This training is much more accelerated than typical for getting started with microfabrication. As the course progresses, you as students take more and more agency in the fabrication process. I really like this form of structure. It allows you to dive into fabricating cool devices from the beginning, but makes it more of a thoughtful exercise than simply following a pre–determined recipe to the t. It helps prepare you to be more independent and capable in the cleanroom. The teaching staff for this course have been terrific. Professor Evelyn Hu is an incredible lecturer – she is so knowledgeable, but very skilled at explaining things in an engaging and effective way. It is clear that she has mastered her art. She puts a lot of care into her lectures, and makes sure to engage with the students, forcing us to think critically about important questions and discuss as a group. She is also very accessible to talk with, and a very kind person. Professor Kiyoul Yang is also terrific. I believe he is teaching this course next year, and if so, you are in for a treat! He is very smart, kind, and thoughtful. The teaching fellows were wonderful as well. You will work with one TF during your labs, and I have found them to be very knowledgeable, supportive, helpful, and kind. This course has an extensive teaching staff: three instructors, eight support staff, and two TFs, for an ~20 student class. You will be well supported.This course comes in two versions: the undergraduate version (ES177), and the graduate version (ES277). The only difference is that ES277 requires a final project. I really enjoyed this aspect of the course, and so if you are interested in doing microfabrication beyond this one–semester course, I would highly recommend enrolling in the graduate version. The project is to propose a process sequence for a device you would like to make – basically, you pick something interesting that you could use microfabrication for, and describe how you'd make it.

It is really a one–of–a–kind experience. The structure consists of one 2–hour lecture and one 4–hour lab each week. This lab time may sound long, but it is well worth it.  No background in microfabrication is assumed. I came in with some background in electrical engineering, which I think allowed me to better appreciate some of the topics we discussed, but this is still a VERY worthwhile class without such background.The amount you learn in this class is incredible, while still being a very reasonable choice workload–wise. You gain access to the cleanroom facilities at the Center for Nanoscale Systems (CNS), and will be trained extensively. Beginning with safety training and basic cleanroom orientation/wet bench training, you then do specialized training in a variety of techniques. As part of a 5–person lab group, everyone will specialize in different areas for training, but you will work together in very cool labs, gaining exposure and experience on all sorts of techniques. We focus on photolithography, chemical & physical vapor deposition, sputtering, reactive ion etching, test & measurement. This gives you a very solid foundation for future microfabrication work.The labs are super interesting. First, you fabricate a PN junction from scratch (a diode). This is one of the most basic semiconductor devices. The second lab is when you make LEDs – it's very satisfying to see them light up! Next is a photodetector (basically a solar cell), and finally, you will fabricate transistors. The focus of this course is on fabrication techniques, not the theory behind semiconductor devices. Some of these may seem like simple devices, but working through this course you really gain an appreciation for all of the care and attention to detail that goes into microfabrication – it's almost an art. You won't be making computer chips with thousands of transistors, but you will be fabricating as advanced devices as one possibly can with only one semester of training. This training is much more accelerated than typical for getting started with microfabrication. As the course progresses, you as students take more and more agency in the fabrication process. I really like this form of structure. It allows you to dive into fabricating cool devices from the beginning, but makes it more of a thoughtful exercise than simply following a pre–determined recipe to the t. It helps prepare you to be more independent and capable in the cleanroom. The teaching staff for this course have been terrific. Professor Evelyn Hu is an incredible lecturer – she is so knowledgeable, but very skilled at explaining things in an engaging and effective way. It is clear that she has mastered her art. She puts a lot of care into her lectures, and makes sure to engage with the students, forcing us to think critically about important questions and discuss as a group. She is also very accessible to talk with, and a very kind person. Professor Kiyoul Yang is also terrific. I believe he is teaching this course next year, and if so, you are in for a treat! He is very smart, kind, and thoughtful. The teaching fellows were wonderful as well. You will work with one TF during your labs, and I have found them to be very knowledgeable, supportive, helpful, and kind. This course has an extensive teaching staff: three instructors, eight support staff, and two TFs, for an ~20 student class. You will be well supported.This course comes in two versions: the undergraduate version (ES177), and the graduate version (ES277). The only difference is that ES277 requires a final project. I really enjoyed this aspect of the course, and so if you are interested in doing microfabrication beyond this one–semester course, I would highly recommend enrolling in the graduate version. The project is to propose a process sequence for a device you would like to make – basically, you pick something interesting that you could use microfabrication for, and describe how you'd make it. People picked a lot of interesting things, from microelectromechanical devices (MEMs) to hardware for neuromorphic computers. After the course, they pick a few projects to fund with $1000 for fabrication, so this is a great chance to get some funding for a project in the cleanroom.All in all, this course is WONDERFUL, and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",0.9997,,0.0,,0.0,109356,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Engineering Sciences,Engineering Sciences,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Section

Melissa and Avery also mentor you one–on–one every week throughout the entire scientific process, from developing a good scientific question/hypothesis to running your experiments to analyzing your data.

It is really a one–of–a–kind experience. The structure consists of one 2–hour lecture and one 4–hour lab each week. This lab time may sound long, but it is well worth it.  No background in microfabrication is assumed. I came in with some background in electrical engineering, which I think allowed me to better appreciate some of the topics we discussed, but this is still a VERY worthwhile class without such background.The amount you learn in this class is incredible, while still being a very reasonable choice workload–wise. You gain access to the cleanroom facilities at the Center for Nanoscale Systems (CNS), and will be trained extensively. Beginning with safety training and basic cleanroom orientation/wet bench training, you then do specialized training in a variety of techniques. As part of a 5–person lab group, everyone will specialize in different areas for training, but you will work together in very cool labs, gaining exposure and experience on all sorts of techniques. We focus on photolithography, chemical & physical vapor deposition, sputtering, reactive ion etching, test & measurement. This gives you a very solid foundation for future microfabrication work.The labs are super interesting. First, you fabricate a PN junction from scratch (a diode). This is one of the most basic semiconductor devices. The second lab is when you make LEDs – it's very satisfying to see them light up! Next is a photodetector (basically a solar cell), and finally, you will fabricate transistors. The focus of this course is on fabrication techniques, not the theory behind semiconductor devices. Some of these may seem like simple devices, but working through this course you really gain an appreciation for all of the care and attention to detail that goes into microfabrication – it's almost an art. You won't be making computer chips with thousands of transistors, but you will be fabricating as advanced devices as one possibly can with only one semester of training. This training is much more accelerated than typical for getting started with microfabrication. As the course progresses, you as students take more and more agency in the fabrication process. I really like this form of structure. It allows you to dive into fabricating cool devices from the beginning, but makes it more of a thoughtful exercise than simply following a pre–determined recipe to the t. It helps prepare you to be more independent and capable in the cleanroom. The teaching staff for this course have been terrific. Professor Evelyn Hu is an incredible lecturer – she is so knowledgeable, but very skilled at explaining things in an engaging and effective way. It is clear that she has mastered her art. She puts a lot of care into her lectures, and makes sure to engage with the students, forcing us to think critically about important questions and discuss as a group. She is also very accessible to talk with, and a very kind person. Professor Kiyoul Yang is also terrific. I believe he is teaching this course next year, and if so, you are in for a treat! He is very smart, kind, and thoughtful. The teaching fellows were wonderful as well. You will work with one TF during your labs, and I have found them to be very knowledgeable, supportive, helpful, and kind. This course has an extensive teaching staff: three instructors, eight support staff, and two TFs, for an ~20 student class. You will be well supported.This course comes in two versions: the undergraduate version (ES177), and the graduate version (ES277). The only difference is that ES277 requires a final project. I really enjoyed this aspect of the course, and so if you are interested in doing microfabrication beyond this one–semester course, I would highly recommend enrolling in the graduate version. The project is to propose a process sequence for a device you would like to make – basically, you pick something interesting that you could use microfabrication for, and describe how you'd make it. People picked a lot of interesting things, from microelectromechanical devices (MEMs) to hardware for neuromorphic computers. After the course, they pick a few projects to fund with $1000 for fabrication, so this is a great chance to get some funding for a project in the cleanroom.All in all, this course is WONDERFUL, and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",0.9997,,0.0,,0.0,109357,Primarily for Graduate Students,Engineering Sciences,Engineering Sciences,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Section

He set an amazingly encouraging precedent early on, asking for ""only positive feedback"" in the beginning of the semester to get folks out of their shells.  Each week, he provides a thick packet of poems that are examples of the weekly poem assignment (you write a poem a week). These poems are awesome –– I've read, reread, and will continue to reread them. Reading a lot of poetry with intentionality is a cheat code to writing better poetry, and these packets really hone the skill of pinpointing when an author utilizes a certain technique. The pace of writing a poem a week is challenging, but soon the expectation of writing polished poetry sloughs off to reveal authentic poetry. Seeing everyone come into their own styles was a joy and each class felt almost spiritual. I trusted that my classmates would leave no stone unturned as much as I trusted them to turn them gently and articulately.As someone who was embarrassed to show anyone my poetry, this class couldn't have been better for me. I almost didn't take it as I read some of Josh's poems online and wasn't certain my style aligned with his. Thank god I did. Josh is scary good at articulating what a poem is doing and even more scary–good at pinpointing what an author is trying to do. He writes paragraphs, no PAGES, for every person in the class every week in response to the weekly assignments. And the stuff is pretty much pure gold every time. He'll write something about you that you didn't even know was there and the effort he puts in to his comments is heroic (I would get some of these emails at 2 or 3am).  TAKE THIS CLASS.

As a class, we avoided the common tendency to jump straight to ""smart"" insights; rather, we went through passages we found beautiful, ironic, or particularly amusing.  Notably, Professor Wood spent a decent portion of our classes reading out loud.

The second half comprehensively covered different kinds of renewable energy systems and helped me understand the technical, not just political, steps necessary to achieve decarbonization.

It was useful to learn the advantages that fossil fuels have, mainly being energy–dense, because that's important to know when building up renewables.)

The assignments were challenging yet fun, interesting, and personal at the same time –– and assignments rarely do that! And they were varied –– essays (descriptive, argumentative, traditional research), art projects, journal entries and reflections, group work, interviews that had us go outside the Harvard bubble to interact with other people, etc.. Just wonderful! I've never been more excited about and fascinated by a class before. Every lecture, every homework assignment was worth it. I was overwhelmed in a very good way by how big and complex the world of migration studies –– and Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights as a field –– is.

The class always felt really rushed especially when talking to other students in different EXPOS classes.

Other expos classes were much more flexible so this excuse didn't make sense to me. The material is interesting though, but you have to have some background in sociology/Marx. Unit 2 was so hard, I really did not like going to class because even though I would pay attention to everything Professor Meyer was throwing at us I could never follow along. She is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable, I bet her other class is much more captivating, but I don't think this topic is suitable for an Expos class.

I don't understand how my writing improved while taking this course. We had discussions about many topics and papers, but what I learned about how to write well (the purpose of this class) was mainly accrued through osmosis. By this I mean that we were exposed to texts that were written by influential people (not renowned for their writing itself but rather their ideas) such as Michael Sandel, but I can't remember a single class during which we focused on craft or style or anything of that sort. We did spend a day on citation formatting. It seems as though this class is a 'choose–your–own–adventure' in regard to how much you actually improve your writing, because that improvement would be nearly entirely self–directed. Class was dominated by people sharing their opinions about a variety of topics, but such discussions, although interesting, did not actually contribute to the missions of the expository writing class. What I will say is that I learned to use evidence for EVERYTHING, but it seems as though this course was more focused on providing warrants for every single one of your claims instead of broader learning about writing.  If you are already a 'good' writer, take this class. But don't take it for the cool name and the movie. Having the research paper be the second essay was too much work in an incredibly short period of time, and it led to half–baked papers. Further, the research assignment itself was poorly explained which caused confusion within the class. I don't understand how Hannah grades and it seems vaguely opinion–based. She is very understanding with extensions, which is a plus for this course. However this is not a reason to take it. Just take a better expos and hand your work in on time. I will say generally to first years selecting their expos: GET CLOSE WITH YOUR CLASS! My favorite memories from this class were going to berg after class and sitting around and chatting. If your expos ends around 6 pm, do an 'expos dinner' as we called it. It's a really special time and you have to do this, regardless of the class that you choose/rank.

What stood out to me the most, perhaps, was how much time he was willing to devote to our learning, always agreeing to set up additional office hours to provide individual help. Also, his comments are incredibly helpful (and I know others share my opinion). Whenever I felt stuck with my essay, I knew that talking to Dr. Napier would guide me in the right direction. I was honestly always amazed how quickly he understood the gist of what my issue was and how helpful the solutions he offered were.In short, unless you know you absolutely do not want to read anything by Austen or Austen–related (but then you probably wouldn't be reading the Q–guide for this class), I sincerely, absolutely recommend this course!

This figure includes everything from writing, researching, lectures and more done for this class. I kept a strict time tracking schedule and these were my results for each week: (The data starts from Monday of each week and the first recorded week is the week of Feb 13. 5:29h means 5 hours and 29 minutes were spent during that week on this class.  )6 h, 4:25h, 8:53h, 2:30h, 8:20h, 0h (school break), 5:29h,  1:53h, 12:06h, 7:49h, 4:09h. I haven't finished the revision of my final paper yet, which will add another 8 hours or more probably. As you can see, some weeks are tough, others are a breeze. Be prepared for this. 28:29 hours were spent on writing, 19:13 spent on lectures, 5:21 on readings, 2:35 on the job cover letters, 3:35 spent on reviewing, preparing for class, and annotations, 0:28 on conferences. More time was spent on some miscellaneous tasks.  My data on the conference times is incorrect, im not sure where I made a mistake. Review: I feel like this was this class was a disappointment. I believe we should have focused less on the content of the readings we did and more on the writing technique of the readings. Although I had a fun time in class and discussion, I didn't learn much about _writing_! I expected more workshops and writing analysis instead of reading comprehension! For a majority of readings, our focus was on WHAT the author(s) were saying. I feel that we should have been focusing on HOW authors were conveying their thoughts. Am I mistaken here? Why didn't we analyze the O'Connoll piece (a piece about a doctor dedicating their life to helping the homeless) as an example of, say, journalistic writing instead of focusing on the content. Don't get me wrong, I cried during that reading, but now that I look back at my semester, I feel as though these were missed opportunities. How did that author manage to make me cry? Give me answers to THAT instead of making me write a random response and write some dumb thing on another classmate's post (That classmate, of course, also couldn't care less about reading my response).  I would have loved to discuss how Crawford, an author we read for unit 1 on the value of manual labor, goes from discussing separation of thinking and doing in modern jobs  to slickly including some Marx in there. I was the wide–eyed freshman who wanted to improve their non–existant writing by taking BOTH of the Studio sequence classes. Boy was I wrong! I believe you should treat the expos class as a College requirement and just take one expos class and be done with it. You will not learn significant writing from this class. My complaint with expos 10 was that I didn't learn much and that we just hung out in class with nothing done. So, I thought maybe salvation lay in studio 20. I thought maybe they wanted to make a very gentle intro and that studio 20 would actually pick up the pace and teach actual writing. Nope. The sad thing is this review will be buried with all of the SEPARATE reviews of the other sections of expos studio 20. Moreover, if you are looking through this review, that mean you probably have taken expos 10 already, so tough luck. You have to take another expos class. If so, then be a realist and take this class anyways. You paid the price of taking expos 10 by having to take two semesters of it. Now, at least benefit from that and make your second semester workload lighter.",0.9718,,0.0,,0.0,116353,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Expository Writing,Expository Writing,,None,,Seminar,Section ES05

His lectures had a good mix of technicality and discussion — and he made the math material accessible for students who didn’t have as much experience before / weren’t STEM concentrators. I loved his tangents, his profession of his dream to die in space and become a historic meteorite in another world, his candid discussions of what mattered most for human progress and human’s foolish history of precluding progress through politics. He inspired me to develop a more sharp, critical view of the world and scientific advancement. This is something I will carry with me. Morgan is awesome. His lectures / activities for the second half were always illuminating, and he clearly cared about everyone in the class. He was always open to questions, no matter how small. I think he was instrumental in setting the tone for the course, and creating a community among the seven of us that was both serious about the work we were doing and compassionate.

The course would benefit greatly if the professor actually taught and lectured regularly, and broke down the information as an instructor should. Professor Edwards neglects to understand that although many of the students in the course may have had experience with the material already, this is still a freshman seminar and there are people with varying degrees of familiarity and experience with the field. Furthermore, the class was dull and badly taught. Frankly, I don't even know why the professor was there. All the class consisted of for most of the weeks was reading several dense scientific papers without any prior contextualizing or introduction from the professor (the papers were generally interesting). Then, we would just spend much of the next class period spitting up the papers' information in completely student–led presentations, again without any feedback or guidance from the professor. The class was lazily structured and badly organized. The class would have been exactly the same if he was not there and we just read the papers on our own without coming to class. The professor barely lectured. He did so perhaps a handful of times over the semester, and even then the lectures were short and not comprehensive. They did not help in understanding or explaining the material. The assignments were useless and were basically just busy–work that wasted time. Most of them required software downloads that we never went back to after one use, so it's not even like the assignments helped with training us how to use the new software for future reference.I came into this class with an interest in evolutionary biology I was hoping to grow. I fortunately left with the same interest, but with a hesitancy to continue studying the field in any capacity while at Harvard.",-0.5672,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

Since we can't read the whole work, the selected excerpts are well selected and feel coherent when looked at together. Reading about the the grail with Arthurian Knights was very interesting and the workload for reading was very manageable. The coolest part about this class is the moving classroom with each class in our quest being held in different locations. This is so cool.

As a renowned palliative care doctor, Susan was able to bring in speakers who touched us deeply, spoke from personal experience, and left us with memories to think about. Finally, Susan brings really delicious chocolate cookies to every class, brings her golden retriever Dante to class sometimes, and invites us to her house for chats. I also want to thank you to all my classmates who are incredibly encouraging, courageous, thoughtful, challenging, and loving. The diversity in the class was able to Because this is a freshman seminar, and Susan said she passes everyone, we get to fully explore this deeply human topic without having to worry about doing anything purely for a good grade. This is a class to wrestle with some important questions on the good life and many existential musings that all of us yearn for to some degree. For example, we watched about 3 documentaries during the semester, and each time the class cried together and bonded through a shared emotion of sorrow, vulnerability, and empathy. The readings are interesting enough and the short writing assignments each week serve as a good reminder to jot down our thoughts.Overall The Heart of Medicine is an absolutely fantastic class, and I would highly recommend anyone interested in the topics of death, suffering, and meaning to apply, you will not regret it.

This course did a great job of introducing us to a variety of philosophical traditions and ideas in a way that felt very accessible and applicable. I had never taken a philosophy course before, and I am glad this was my first! I felt that I was truly able to engage with a diverse set of ideas and think critically about my own views, both of which I found very engaging and fulfilling. Furthermore, I found myself discussing a lot of the topics we were covering frequently throughout the semester, which I think is a great sign that the ideas were interesting and important. The focus on the application also meant that I immediately started using some of the ideas from class in my daily life (usually without thinking about it first).The courseload was pretty manageable. Many small regular assignments (reading quizzes every class, weekly reflections) were added this year. I thought they were reasonable, and I actually found the reflections to be pretty interesting and useful to me in developing my personal opinions. (By the way, I felt like we were really encouraged to have our own opinions on the content and discuss what we did and didn't agree with in the readings, which I really appreciated.)I came into this class interested in learning, and like most classes, I think you will get out of it what you put into it.

The readings are quite long and there are way too many of them, but you have to do them because there is a graded quiz at the beginning of each lecture about the readings. However, all that Rinard does in lecture is talk through the readings, so there is basically no point in being there, but you have to because there's a chance she'll say something else important, and there are no resources or notes distributed, so if you miss it you'll just lose points on the exam. (The class also has two exams and two papers, which is somewhat ridiculous for a gened.) The papers are not too long, but the prompts are very dull, and they do this thing where they won't give good grades on your first submission, but then offer you a chance to rewrite the paper, so you essentially have to do each one twice. You also have to do a one page reflection piece every week, even when not very much material has been covered.In short, this class makes you do a ridiculous amount of work for a very small amount of learning.",-0.9514,"I'd still recommend, but the course is slightly different than previous years that raved about it being a gem. They added quizzes every class to make sure you do the readings, and sometimes they are hard or obscure so that even if you did the reading you still get things wrong. Nevertheless, it is a good course! Exams are easy, and the only big assignments are 2 papers throughout the year. If you put the time into doing the readings and engaging in lecture discussions, you can also leave with some great ideas about Happiness and the purpose of life. While the course sounds like a little more work than previous years, I'd still call it a pseudo–gem and a great course to check off a GenEd requirement!",0.9855,,,,,,,,,

Professor Hsieh is such a great conversation facilitator that time flew by every class. Professor Hsieh and my TF (Kaum) were so nice and approachable. Each week, we discuss a really interesting HBS case that pertains to finding a career, avoiding ethical pitfalls at work, and shaping the world of work for others. There is not much work but a really good opportunity to think deeply about what you value in your work and personal life. In addition, Professor Hsieh opts for real–life cases instead of dense philosophical readings, which I think is a positive. In the current form of the class, we didn't spend too much time explicitly mapping out our own career choices. So, definitely do not expect to have figured out your career by the end. Rather, the cases more liberally talk about the meaning of work in our own lives and others.

I was little anxious coming into the class (actually I was shaking in my boots), but I stuck with it and got an incredibly enriching experience in addition to free finger puppets. To future students, don’t be intimidated at all by the texts, the course is very doable if you put some earnest effort and time towards it. Lecture can be a little bit of a strange experience for those more accustomed to science/math lectures; Prof Damrosch speaks a lot and much of the substance is in his words and not the slides. That all being said the lectures themselves felt to go beyond the readings in a sense; you could succeed in the class just listening to them and not taking notes. The biggest help is actively trying to make connections between the texts you read. Before enrolling in this class, I’d recommend looking at the syllabus and bearing in mind the number of readings and discussion post assignments; I took this class with Chem27 and SCRB50 so at times the readings got a little in the way. The work load is fine; just schedule time for your readings and your discussion posts you’ll breeze through them.The TFs are all bangers; help them help you especially when it comes to your final projects and exam prep.If you’re a big STEM person, I’d recommend taking this class. As a big STEM person myself, this class opened my eyes to extremely important texts and topics. Seeing the comp lit folks and how that department operates. is also quite entertaining.

You will need to provide HUHS urgent care notes from the same day for any abcense, even a headache, if you would like any understanding at all you've better have intense proof of illness,   there is no logic to some of the policies (for example you get attendance zeros that you can't make up if you switch into the course, the teaching staff will not budge on it, or you can be in class for the full hour–15 but if you didn't get the quiz code in the 30 seconds it was flashed on the screen on the dot at 3pm when class starts, you don't count at attended. If you can't remember tiny details from entire books you read previous weeks, you can fail the attendance quiz and not count, the midterm and final grades can end up being nasty surprises no matter how well you think you know an author you've read in many other Harvard classes. Many times they have denied students who are taking off their coat or sitting down, coming from another class, I mean clearly THERE, right to their face. Just 0 understanding. The work itself is not that hard, but the standards around it took up so much mental space this semester at the expense of my thesis, actual department classes on similar topics, and well being. It's the worst of the GENED system flaws for sure coupled with holier than thou teachers who are welcome to make changes, mistakes, etc.. but are hardline on everything with the students in return. They will actively keep information from you, no mater how many students explained they really wanted to attend the review session, they refused to zoom it, share any of the info given in it, and basically blamed you or not attending an outside of class session during reading week.

Professor Atherton's lectures are not only informative, but truly engaging and entertaining (he has such a good sense of humor!). He has an extraordinary talent for presenting complex concepts in a clear and concise manner that is easy for students to understand. He took the time to get to know each and every one of us, and was always available to answer questions or provide feedback. He truly cares about his students' success and goes above and beyond to ensure that we have the tools we need to excel. His passion for his subject matter is infectious, and he has a unique ability to ignite that same passion in his students.

The readings were also mostly unengaging.Additionally, the course takes a heavy nosedive into critical theory discussion in the second half that mostly seems disconnected from the actual techniques of filmmaking, and falls into the standard traps of talking at the students of the political premises without really evaluating or challenging their assumptions. The lectures especially became tedious with discussing the ideas in the annoying way that made them seem unchallengeable, as well as increasingly jargon–ridden (you'll grow very sick of hearing the word ""space/spaces"" by the end). So many of the texts grew increasingly obtuse and overly didactic that they were not engaging to read for someone not as into those ideas to begin with.Also, the end of the class had this weird group reciting of a political treatise that seemed very propagandistic.",-0.9062,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

One thing that I think frustrated everybody, whether or not they attended lecture, was just the severe disorganization of the course, especially in the beginning. I think this partly wasn't their fault, as 3–4x times the number of people in previous years enrolled this time around, so the teaching staff wasn't prepared and hadn't hired enough TFs to have enough sections for all those students. Because of this, section started quite late in the semester, but honestly I wasn't complaining. Another point of disorganization came when it was time for the midterm. The head TF said the midterm would be posted/available at a certain date, and it wasn't. He made promises over email several times about when the grades of the midterm would be released, and failed every single one of those promises.

I also really liked how the final paper (if you're not doing an engaged section) is pretty much self–directed, because it leaves a lot of creative direction to write about something you really care about. Once section started, I really liked it, especially since my TF made sure to reemphasize important notes from lecture and had us often debate or take certain sides of an issue, to help prepare us for the argumentative nature of the exams. There were usually only 3 people participating in these rather large sections, and that's because a majority of people didn't go to lecture. Over 400 people enrolled in this class and less than 40 would show up to lecture on a regular basis. Many people treated this class like the easy 4th or 5th class they didn't have to pay attention to, and started regretting it towards the end when the grade on our 1 midterm was a bit low and they didn't participate in section. Overall, just make sure to take notes at every lecture (keep a running document or something similar), participate in section, and go over the weekly study questions in the syllabus to help prepare for exams.",0.9915,"Overall, would not recommend this course to anyone. This course has potential but very poor execution by teaching staff. My sections were very poorly planned: most of the time, we just kept discussing the same thing over the semester. For many sections, it was obvious that my TF had not put thought into what the section was about and would allocate 20 minutes for us to just sit in silence and ""do the readings."" TF would also just not respond to emails. Midterm grades were not handed out until a month later, and everyone got very generic comments. It was very obvious that the head TF who graded mine did not read my response, because he copy and pasted comments that were not even applicable to my midterm — the same thing happened to many others in my section. The second half of the class was planned extremely poorly: we had a final essay due and then a final exam the next day. The explanation we received for the delay in midterm grading was that there was not enough teaching support. Given that, I thought it was ridiculous that we had a final essay and a final exam — how many people are actually going to get their papers read and graded fairly? It's laughable that we are having our labor exploited in a class about labor exploitation. Overall, one of the worst classes I've taken at Harvard. I cannot believe the Gen–ed office allows this class to continue to exist.",-0.9766,"You get what you put into the course. Professor Patterson is not a great lecturer, he usually reads off the slides and you can barely hear what he is saying. He also does not share the slides, but the class is recorded. As the semester goes on, you see less and less people in the lecture hall and to be honest,  going to lecture is not really necessary if you have a good section component. Unless you are passionate about the topic, I suggest looking into another course. If you are looking for a gem, this is definitely it. My section (fortunately) was great, the conversations, topics and discussions helped cover and summarize what was said in class. Looking back at this class, it helped me have a breathing room from harder courses but I would have liked to maybe try another class instead.

The un–grading model is actually great in my opinion and really provides a constructive experience without adding needless stressors and punishments.Things I didn't always like: the books :( ... Sarraute was incredible, Gary very entertaining, Louis and Guibert quite readable – but most of the rest inspired indifference at best. As far as I can tell, Professor Kim had two main goals in her text selection: first, to advance an anti–identitarian argument; second, to shock you with gratuitous content. The former is perfectly fine but should be noted to attune your expectations – themes of identity and associated issues of social justice are the focus of almost all discussion. The latter goal is where I more particularly object – Professor Kim makes fine arguments that we should attend less to our shock and avoid discounting texts just for covering unpleasant material; however, she does not always compellingly prove that these particular texts are worthy of this effort. For instance, just because French critics were wrong to attack Darrieussecq's All the Way for its swearing and graphic sex (notably of the underage protagonist and her crusty adult babysitter) doesn't mean it is immune to being bad for other reasons – like its oddly TERF–y tone – and certainly doesn't prove that it is good.",0.9943,This is the horniest course offered at Harvard and not in a fun way.,-0.4023,"Take this class no matter your background (STEM, humanities, etc.) if you are ready to put the work in and do the readings.

Although I took this class for concentration credit, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is exploring and looking to learn something very useful and interesting. The workload is very manageable too since  this class has an unusual way of assigning homework that helps students a lot.

It combines simple econ theories with politics and then has you apply them to some real–world events, but basically in class we talk about theories like game theory and prisoner's dilemma instead of different international conflicts around the world and the motivations behind them. Because of this very simplified way of thinking about politics, all the assignments in the class become a checklist of what you need to say, instead of really being able to apply the concepts in complex ways. I wouldn't recommend this class if you're looking for a deeper dive into the actual history and complexity behind international conflicts, but only if you want to learn about how some intro econ models apply to politics. Also, the two lectures of class were easily simplified into a few slides in section. I think the content of the course isn't enough to be a course and so it really tries to stretch at times and ends up being somewhat dull/easy to zone out in. Overall, I think the way the class was set up detracted from the actual learning of the student (focuses very harshly on minute and I would say sometimes irrelevant details), so I wouldn't recommend this class if you want a comprehensive learning experience about international conflict and cooperation.",-0.7923,,0.0,126258,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Government,Government,,Social Sciences,,Lecture,Section

For me, it was just ok. The week to week work load is light (relatively short readings and discussion post) however, the written assignments are very time consuming, and take a lot of effort to plan effectively. The grading is very tough and unpredictable, and you may find that even your best effort only earns a B. While the rubric can act as a guide, ultimately you're grade is determined in part at the discretion of your TF. Definitely make sure you pick a topic you're really interested in, as all of the assignments in this class culminate in a final paper focused on a tangential topic.

For me, it was just ok. The week to week work load is light (relatively short readings and discussion post) however, the written assignments are very time consuming, and take a lot of effort to plan effectively. The grading is very tough and unpredictable, and you may find that even your best effort only earns a B. While the rubric can act as a guide, ultimately you're grade is determined in part at the discretion of your TF. Definitely make sure you pick a topic you're really interested in, as all of the assignments in this class culminate in a final paper focused on a tangential topic.

The greatest strength of the course consisted of its teaching staff: Ms. Leonie Beyrle and Professor Latanya Sweeney did a fantastic job helping students navigate each unit, and they worked with their outstanding teaching fellows to provide very thorough, insightful, and constructive feedback on coursework. Lastly, the class assignments were very fun and engaging to work on. Because they also focused on very current/important topic areas, I felt like I was actually contributing to commentary on these subjects in a meaningful and insightful way.I would highly recommend this class to students with an interest in technology and its impact on society. Absolutely zero technical expertise or experience is needed, as there is no coding required in the course.

If you are good at presenting, I would for sure take this course. My TF graded relatively well but was a bit nitpicky. Ensure that you are a great presenter and you could walk out with an A in GOV 1759.Next, there are two exams — one midterm and one final. These exams were both online, open note, but the Professor had issues with the final remaining online due to new University guidance. Since the exams were open note, they were easier than if in person, due to not having to memorize ample information on the course studies or behavioral concepts. The exams are multiple choice structured, with a few additional short response and long answer questions. I scored pretty good on the first exam and am waiting for my Final exam score. However, the exams are easy enough if you study a bit. It is integral to know key information about the behavioral concepts and course studies so you are able to answer both the multiple choice and short response questions! I made sure to study for both exams and am happy about my results.The next portion of your grade is course participation, which constituted discussion board posts (presumably credit / no credit) and in person attendance at “sections” which were just watching people’s presentations. I assume that the discussion posts are graded for completion since I got no formal feedback, but my TF contacted some students to do their discussion posts better or to complete ones they didn’t. Since participation is merely showing up to the section and isn’t based on formal engagement in course, I think this will be good for students!The content of the course is very interesting, too!

The reading, however, is very intensive and dense! I would recommend having taken a few upper level humanities courses before taking this one. I often found myself spending 10hrs+ per week to fully comprehend and digest the deep texts that Professor Forrester gave us. This is not a slight on the course or the Professor — just ensure that your reading and writing skills are to the level that this course demands of you, especially since it is open to both undergraduate and graduate students.Professor Forrester is so insightful and I loved hearing her commentary every week on the texts and topics at hand. I also think this discussion was illuminated by the guest speakers we had. We had many guest speakers with 2 commentators — one PHD student and one professor — who applied a critique to the texts at hand. I thought this was especially interesting when analyzing the texts as we had multiple perspectives. I thought the final paper was interesting. It was an open ended ~25 page assignment that had to touch on the course themes. I have not got feedback yet, but it is 80% of our grade so make sure that you are committed to writing a longer piece. The other part of our grade (20%) is course attendance/participation. Overall, please take this course. I hope that they offer this course in other academic years as students deserve to learn the complexities of political and economic theory on this subject, especially with such an accomplished professor like Professor Forrester!",0.988,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

She assigns one (generally relatively recent) book on China and allows students to pick from a list of other non–China classics in the field on the topic. The juxtaposition of the two books was generally thought–provoking and helpful, and also meant that I both learned more about the field and had some agency in picking my weekly readings. (It did also mean that the course was a lot of work, but I think it's absolutely worth your while to read both books .) Overall, I gained a deeper understanding of important topics in comparative politics and in the study of China.",0.904,,0.0,,0.0,110836,Primarily for Graduate Students,Government,Government,,Social Sciences,,Seminar,Section

It gives you very practical knowledge and experience in survey development and results evaluation. The survey project that you do throughout the course is a really cool way to design a real survey collaboratively with the professor and other students, problem–solve real issues, do your own analysis, and end up with findings that are relevant to you which can be written into a publishable paper. As a PhD student, it's great to walk away from a class with a project that generated interesting novel data written into an actual publishable paper that aligns with your research interests. With the readings and course topic discussions, I learned a lot about public opinion survey design and analysis as well as was able to reinforce political science knowledge relevant to my field of study. Steve is a very approachable professor who really welcomes differing viewpoints and experiences into his classroom for everyone to learn from each other. He's incredibly knowledgeable and experienced in the topics and methods and also creates a very welcoming and fun classroom environment. Previous experience with survey design and already having research questions in mind about a short survey you would want to do is very helpful to being able to dive right into the course and get the most out of it.

I wish we had spent time examining early racial identity formation in the U.S. and gotten more perspectives from other historical scholars in our readings. This class also suffers from too much busy work as it stands—particularly with excessive, repetitive weekly zine journals (which were often on zines that were unrelated to course content and that we wouldn't discuss in class) and the lengthy weekly annotations, which often felt contrived/lent itself to us rehashing the same ideas each week.",-0.5789,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

This class focuses on people and identities that have been intentionally and systematically erased from institutional history. This means that rather than lectures full of ""facts,"" this class is more concerned with stories, people, and holding space for individual accounts and emotions. Yes, this meant that class was sometimes not as exciting as professors whose every lecture is like a TED talk, but I believe it was a super valuable change of pace that requires active participation (choosing to dig deeper and be thoughtful) than passive learning through transcribing what the professor says.

SEA is really a crucible and a proxy for international trends. It's the seat of colonial conflict (e.g., British vs Burmese), imperial competition (e.g., French vs. British vs. Dutch scrambling for SEA), and crucial historical concepts (e.g., imperialism, anti–colonialism, militarism etc.). I wish it spent more time on contemporary era – it is mostly 1800–1950, with a big focus on the transition from pre–colonial to colonial to post–colonial states. There are so many links with South Asian and East Asian History so if you study either of those regions, I HIGHLY recommend taking this class. It'll contextualise so much of what is happening inside those regions too. Also SEA history is very helpful if you study Buddhism.It's not too difficult – I would say a regular history class.

On the one hand, Professor Gordon is truly such a great teacher. His lectures are really well organized (he has a handout every lecture with an outline of the lecture which helps you follow along) and really clear (no small feat given the difficulty of the readings). You come away from each lecture with a clear idea of what you are supposed to have learned, and you come away from the class with a clear understanding of the arc of Hegel and Marx's work and the major themes and ideas that you should take away from the class. The essays are extremely manageable, and you get good feedback on them. Section discussions can be enlightening and help you understand major questions and ideas better. If you take this class you will become a much better reader, potentially a better writer, and you will have a much much better understanding of Hegel and Marx's ideas and how they fit into a particular kind of thought. That being said, I do want to warn about a few things. For one, the readings are hard. It may take you like five minutes to read a single page of Hegel at times (if not longer). At times you might feel too stupid for this class. You will probably be very confused at times. But going through this is precisely the process that will make you learn a lot in this class. If you don't want to put in the time for that, though, this class is probably not for you. I will also say that the readings are almost exactly ordered to go from the hardest reading to the easiest reading, so do keep that in mind if the first few weeks are hard. (The Science of Logic is practically unintelligible, Phenomenology of Spirit is not much better, but after that the readings get easier and you get better at them/ get a feel for it. And Marx is not too hard to read, though you still have read attentively.) The other thing is the people in this class. The class was mostly white people and mostly white men. I don't know if that was just a quirk of this year, but my section was about 2/3 white men ––– there were only a few women/ POC. There were also some people in the class who had a lot of experience reading theory/ philosophy, and had already read these works in particular, which was kind of intimidating at first in section (some of them made smart, insightful comments and some of them just tried to show off). However, I would say that for the most part section discussions were really interesting, fulfilling, and accessible (Hegel is hard and so he is a great equalizer). So, if you feel intimidated in the first few weeks of class that is totally valid, but chances are you can handle this class! Personally I am really glad that I stuck with the course. But do be aware that at times the vibes might be bad.",0.9904,Too hard :(,-0.5106,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

The course is really really broad – it is technically Modern Latin American history, but you focus a good amount on the colonial period and 19th century history, so it's really a massive overview. This means we didn't talk about some countries, talked about some a lot more than others, focused primarily on political and economic history, and were focused mostly on drawing connections across the region. It's definitely flawed for this reason, but it's an accessible intro course. Work load wise I was almost never able to do the main 50 pages of reading but the only readings you needed for sections were the primary source docs which were usually a total of 20 pages which wasn't too bad. The midterm was tough because you're really pressed for time, but the final was doable because you got a full 3 hours with a pretty similar test structure. Prof. Weld is the highlight of this course – I honestly would take it just to take a class with her if you're on the fence. She is a really cool prof and great lecturer who had me engaged almost every class and is insanely knowledgable. Lucas is honestly a pretty meh TF in my opinion (sections were just kinda bland, not a ton of discussion), but he is nice to meet one–on–one with if you need help with the paper. Overall – I don't regret my choice to take this class, but it's not totally perfect. I heard in the past it was better when it was a bit more focused (it used to be Latin American and its history with the U.S.) and with a different TF, but even if they changed nothing with the course I still think it's very valuable – I learned a TON, got to take a class with Prof. Weld, and the research paper (although its a painful 10 pg of research for those of us burnt out from writing papers) is a really cool way to learn more in depth about anything you're interested in.",0.9975,"You really learn a lot about LatAm's history, culture, and struggles — and a lot about US history too that isn't always told or said outright.

You learn so much very quickly; I think in one week of this course I learned more than I did a semester in high school or even in my history course at Harvard I took prior. There are a lot of readings and if you don't have knowledge already on Soviet history, expect that this class will consume a lot of your life. I spent almost all of Friday–Sunday just focused on this course and really understanding the readings with a lot of annotations. The weekly one page papers are really fun to write and allow you to connect your personal interests to the topics. If you take this course, be prepared for an active discussion in the class with a lot of counter factuals and thinking on your feet. The readings are a lot––200–300 pages of very dense sources, about 7 primary sources and 7 secondary source excerpts each week. You cover a lot of material across a lot of lenses, but all of it is focused on a single policy of the Soviet government––the nationalities policy. You will thoroughly understand this policy, but it is a singular policy, so I would recommend this class if you are the person who likes to go into depth into one topic. Every reading came back to this policy. However, you will cover political, literary, cultural, linguistic, art history lenses of this policy so you will learn to speak to a lot of disciplines.There is a 5 page book report and oral presentation which gives a lot of good practice in verbal communication. Professor Martin has vey high expectations that he will hold you to. It was roughly half undergrad/grad. He reads your work very very carefully and provides specific feedback that helps you grow as a historian, writer, and presenter, but as such, be prepared to put a lot into this class, as he will expect that and demand that, but you will get a lot out. There is a roughly 15 page paper for a final which is very flexible and illustrates how you will get to pursue your interests in this class. You will speak with him 1:1 and he is very responsive to make sure that you are set up for success and have enough access to resources. but all of these require a lot of proactivity and initiative! I even emailed him about something he casually mentioned in class and he gave me databases and resources to explore on my own. This class requires you to have a genuine enthusiasm and interest to drive that proactivity!!In short, I highly recommend this class, but you have to have a strong love of the subject matter and learning. Professor Martin is my favorite professor so far and puts a lot into this class and will ensure you grow as a scholar. I am very grateful for every moment of this class which I will treasure and I expect this class to have formed some of the most special moments of my undergraduate career.",0.9982,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

I really didn't like the guest lecture structure of the course –– the guests were great, but there were too many of them and the course ended up feeling a little incoherent. I understand that it was meant to be an American Studies taste–tester, but it felt like we went through too many subjects too rapidly without ever really delving deeply into any of them, and we didn't engage much with course material in sections, which exacerbated the feeling of going too fast without real coherence. I actually found the early parts of the class where we were studying American Studies historiography –– the history of the field itself –– the most interesting part of the course. I think any class should be teaching something that it is better at teaching than any other class can teach it, and a taste test of each subfield of American Studies is never gonna be as good as each subfield's full dish. This class would play better to its strengths if it really centered more around the question of defining American Studies and practicing it, rather than sitting through long lectures that offer minimal participation in a big room with a new professor each time. I think it should be smaller (and maybe have a cap of ~25) to enforce attendance and participation –– I and lots of others stopped really wanting to attend, and I never felt like I learned anything particularly new in section that I couldn't have learned in lecture; the TF didn't really guide conversation or asked questions that prompted discussion. Everyone was very kind and well intentioned but I think the class needs significant restructuring/refocusing –– mostly sad because the first two weeks were great and I was SO excited for the class (and some of the writing prompts were incredible) but we rarely received feedback on writing (in a class that was structured around writing) and so I felt pretty disengaged by the end.",0.9951,"Professor Deloria is very kind and charismatic, but the course is a mess.

Professor Faust made herself very accessible through office hours, and was always willing to provide feedback over email as well. Plus, she has a fascinating collection of stories to share!A second strength of the course consisted of its students, who hailed from a diverse array of ""Harvard backgrounds"". This made student contributions interesting and eye–opening, and made the class even more enjoyable.A third strength of the course was its syllabus: we covered a very broad and interesting collection of speeches in the course. The opportunity to do so helped us discern nuances between different ""genres"" of speeches, and to better appreciate oratory as an art.A final strength of the course consisted of its guest speakers.

The course delved into the intricate details and historical contexts of iconic structures such as the Ise Shrine, Katsura Villa, and Himeji Castle.Professor Lippit's eloquent presentational style is both engaging and informative. He adeptly elucidates complex architectural concepts, historical underpinnings, and cultural subtleties, creating a vivid tapestry of pre–modern Japanese architecture. His evident passion for the subject matter infuses each lecture, fostering a stimulating learning environment.The course content offers a comprehensive examination of pre–modern Japanese architecture. Students probe the cultural, religious, and aesthetic foundations of these renowned structures, gaining valuable insights into their significance and the mastery of their designA distinguishing feature of the course is the thoughtful selection of field trips orchestrated by Professor Lippit. Students are afforded the opportunity to examine two local architectural gems: the Machiya at Boston Children's Museum and the Harvard teahouse. These visits serve to contextualize and reinforce the knowledge acquired in the classroom, allowing students to appreciate the craftsmanship and architectural nuances firsthand.In summation, this course presents an enlightening and enriching foray into the world of Japanese design, history, and culture. Through his refined presentational skills, well–structured content, and astute selection of field trips, this course stands as an invaluable experience for those interested in architecture and Japanese design.",0.987,"standard art history class. focus on very old Japanese architecture, may find boring if not very interested in subject",-0.5824,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

Can water transcend physical properties and hold spiritual significance?” Is water truly lifeless?”) hindered the development of meaningful critical discussion and left us students feeling adrift in a sea (pun intended) of fragmented scholarship. If you’re seeking a substantive exploration of water as an undergraduate, perhaps consider alternative educational opportunities outside of the classroom, far away from Harvard, that offer a more coherent and meaningful understanding of environmental issues writ large.In fairness to the wonderful History of Science Department and to the professor, it is worth acknowledging that devoting an entire semester to the study of water poses inherent challenges. There’s only so much you can say about this topic before having to grasp at ideological straws; by the fourth or fifth week, it became increasingly evident to many of us the course was stretching thin and struggling to sustain rigorous analysis. It soon became a running joke for enrollees to figure out what we were going to say next about “the multifaceted nature of water” as we walked into the classroom.",0.9598,"This course was interesting, but it caused a lot of confusion and frustration because of improper communication and disorganization.

Her course was an absolute diamond — the readings were interesting and very accessible, she was kind, and she included so many engaging activities in the lectures. Often, in addition to pair–and–shares, Professor Labonte would include activities where she'd hand out a picture of a graph from part of a crucial research paper in the field and we'd try to determine what the paper was about, or what the figure meant. She always walked around the class to listen in and ask questions to the students who were discussing the paper in groups. Furthermore, her lectures were connected to the readings, but weren't repetitive. I always felt like I was learning something new! At some point, I stopped taking notes in the class, just because I felt like it was so interesting and so engaging that I didn't need the notes to be able to remember all of it. Professor Labonte also emphasized that she was very interested in meeting with students, and meeting with her was always really interesting! During every class, she'd frequently mention that she often ""debated"" what to put into the lectures, just because there was so much interesting material to share!

At the same time, the HistSci concentrators I knew in the class were some of the most active, so it must have been very engaging on multiple fronts, even with my limited academic perspective. The class talks about major events/discoveries/observations/advances I was aware of from an MCB perspective but focuses on the historical and thereby political and/or cultural events that made the history we talk about through the course significant, connected, and relevant to the modern day.

You absolutely MUST STUDY EVERY WEEK for multiple hours, not just before the exam. I know a lot of professors say this when it isn't really true, but it is true for this course. I did very well in this class and I loved it, which are not unrelated – if you don't actively want to study the material, you will fail the exams, as it is entirely memorization based (I think I memorized about ~800 individual facts for the second exam alone). I got A's on my exams, but I also studied 40+ hours for each, because I genuinely found the material interesting. Also be warned that this class may consume your other courses if you let it, I wouldn't take it concurrently with another high time commitment class. All that aside, this was such an incredible course. I was afraid to take it because of the warnings about the difficult exams, etc. but I am so glad I went for it. I learned so much about the human body and it piqued my interest in a possible medical career. This was easily one of my favorite courses so far at Harvard despite the time commitment.

Oisín's section was also super helpful. My perspective is so much richer now that I've taken this –– it offers so many interesting explanations for phenomena I took for granted!The class is pretty fast–paced and does build on itself, and the material is pretty dense and non–intuitive, so go to lecture and section! You can get by without it for doing the psets, but it'll help a lot for the final and lecture is great regardless so it's definitely worth putting the time in. The psets are unironically fun to do –– they're graded check+/check/check– so as not to be stressful. The final exam is an interesting but incredibly intense 24–hour takehome, and you really need to have understood the material to do a comprehensive job.Overall I think if you are interested in historical linguistics/PIE then this is a great way to learn about it!

The course is way less crowded, you get almost a personalized math question center experience (I became friends with the course assistants), office hours are productive and the professor and TF get to know you and your math weaknesses/strengths so well. I heard that Fall 1A can be packed and it is harder to use the support network, so I'd tell you to keep that in mind. Having said that, this class is not easy. It may be way easier for those who took calculus in high school (2/3 of this class tbh), but if you didn't then you might struggle like I did (it had been over a year since my last math class in HS). But struggling doesn't mean failing, and I learned so much with this class –– at certain points I was actually excited about math even though I never saw myself as a math person. Still, the amount of time you spend on this can be intense depending on your background.

This was just an awesome course, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a bit difficult, but nothing crazy. Everything we learned felt very important and worthwhile as a person in an increasingly–data–driven world. I had taken some stats before, but didn't really understand what I'd learned... This class was much more applied and helped me consolidate that knowledge, so it's actually helpful for me now in my daily life! MATLAB experience was good, too. I came in with none (but did have a tad bit of coding experience beforehand, nothing stellar...), and I still did OK. There were only a couple problems sets that were MATLAB–heavy, so you'll need to pop into office hours for those if you're weaker there, but it truly wasn't a problem. It was generally a good low–stakes environment to pick up some MATLAB skills, so could be useful if you're taking more MATLAB–intensive courses down the line. The support system was EXCELLENT when I took it– the ratio of staff to students was 1:4. I think the small size of this class is a HUGE advantage and I can't recommend enough taking this class over 21b if you're less math–inclined like I am. I think it gets less into the weeds of linear algebra than 21b, from what I've heard (?), which for me is ideal, as I just wanted enough depth to feel in–the–loop about computational methods I'll use in my work which linear algebra forms the foundation of. The pace was PERFECT for me: enough to be challenging, but never enough that I felt left behind. There are a few tougher lessons than others, but all are highly–manageable, warning is given in advance, and support is bountiful. I love, love, love linear algebra after this course! Everything just made sense!",0.9983,"If you want linear algebra, take 21 or 22. If you want statistics, go take a stats course. This course suffers from significant structural issues, course policies are unfair, and grading is harsh. It is too small of a class with graduate students, making for a terrible class environment. Students (even fellow undergrads) refuse to cooperate and collaborate because they want you to fail (competition for no reason), and there are no practice tests provided for small exams that just punish you for small mistakes. You cannot succeed in this course without having taken linear algebra. Lectures are non traditional and, in my opinion, not conducive to learning. Course materials are outdated, unreadable, and not open on Canvas when you need them for a problem set. Regardless of who is teaching this course, you should avoid this course at all costs.  Harvard should separate 19b from 18b.  It's a shame since 19a was so wonderful. If you took 19a, go take 21.",-0.9806,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

As a ec major, this wasn't necessarily the most interesting class, which made studying and psets feel like a chore and I dreaded it a lot more. However, it is an excellently structured class that has really changed with feedback! I personally do like the idea of 3 psets a week, and they are pretty short(most of the time) and it's good at consolidating content before you move on as the class moves incredibly fast. I do personally regret taking the class because it was kind of a waste of time(if you're ec just take math 18 instead, some content in this class feels pretty inapplicable to the ec field and was more STEM). Take it with friends or be ready to make friends! pset buddies are an incredible resource. I also love roderic, he's one of my fav preceptor's I've ever had, super down to earth, funny, and overall truly cares about his students.

It feels to need to justify the way it teaches everything; one problem on a PSET told us to explain a certain concept as if we were talking to a friend, and then included a footnote saying that ""studies show teaching a concept to someone else helps you learn it better."" No one cares. On the surface, this is just mildly annoying, but it speaks to a deeper issue in the course: they refuse to teach you anything upfront. During every section, the TF will talk for like 5–10 minutes max, and then you spend the rest of the class working though a worksheet that will ultimately help you figure out what the formula–of–the–day is. I get the pedagogical rationale here — by having us try to figure things out on our own, we will hopefully gain a better fundamental understanding of it. But at a certain point, I want you just to teach me! Instead of spending an hour trying to figure this out on my own, you could just tell me what the formula is — explain why it works — and we can call it a day! What's especially frustrating is that this course eschews any attempt to get at a deeper theoretical understanding of what we are doing. You learn (read: teach yourself) one, fairly straightforward concept per section, and that's it. The material is very surface–level yet is also taught very inefficiently. In general, though, aside from these frustrations, the course is pretty good. The material is just generally quite fun — doing things in 3D is cool! The 3 PSETs a week are a total drag but it does drill the material into you. And they're really not very hard most of the time.Still, I'd recommend people take the 22A/B series instead.

It feels to need to justify the way it teaches everything; one problem on a PSET told us to explain a certain concept as if we were talking to a friend, and then included a footnote saying that ""studies show teaching a concept to someone else helps you learn it better."" No one cares. On the surface, this is just mildly annoying, but it speaks to a deeper issue in the course: they refuse to teach you anything upfront. During every section, the TF will talk for like 5–10 minutes max, and then you spend the rest of the class working though a worksheet that will ultimately help you figure out what the formula–of–the–day is. I get the pedagogical rationale here — by having us try to figure things out on our own, we will hopefully gain a better fundamental understanding of it. But at a certain point, I want you just to teach me! Instead of spending an hour trying to figure this out on my own, you could just tell me what the formula is — explain why it works — and we can call it a day! What's especially frustrating is that this course eschews any attempt to get at a deeper theoretical understanding of what we are doing. You learn (read: teach yourself) one, fairly straightforward concept per section, and that's it. The material is very surface–level yet is also taught very inefficiently. In general, though, aside from these frustrations, the course is pretty good. The material is just generally quite fun — doing things in 3D is cool! The 3 PSETs a week are a total drag but it does drill the material into you. And they're really not very hard most of the time.Still, I'd recommend people take the 22A/B series instead.

The psets are heavier than 1b and the m series for sure, but they are not impossible if you start them right after class. This class has a LOT of content so there really was never time to revisit concepts from classes prior unless there was an intentional connection, so if you are lost you should spend time with it immediately (go to quiz session, watch the pre–work video, read the handout/textbook reading). I have never struggled in math and passed calculus with flying colors, and I could pass my past math exams without studying (psets and going to class were enough), BUT THIS CLASS was where I met my match. I wouldn't say it is hard in terms of being overworked but studying for this class is completely different than studying for calculus, because I'm being so serious I have studied like I never have before and I nor any of my friends really saw their effort translate into their performance on exams. I failed both midterms, and even though I studied exponentially harder for the second one, i literally did worse.  The exams are extremely different from the material you see in class, but you are not necessarily being tested on something you weren't taught. Only someone who truly understands conceptually is able to come up with the solutions. What's worse is that there is limited time on exams, so honestly there are problems that I know I would've figured out had I been given more time. I would say course staff is available for sure though and amazing (which is weird because idk most times at harvard when ur struggling its not you its the instructor). I would say that instructors, at least jill, teach you like a college student and don't necessarily say things in the most simplest terms, so you are definitely challenged with understanding jargon and notation and stuffs. Overall, I really liked this class and I would recommend linear algebra broadly because I strongly appreciate its applications. I have never appreciated math the way I have appreciate linear algebra, and even though this was a challenge, I would do it again. I would say If i could do it again I might actually watch the pre–work videos and do more readings throughout, perhaps then I would have built enough intuition to do well on exams. I would have also started going to quiz sessions earlier on ( i strongly recommend these). Go to quiz sessions because those drops add up, AND it is a super efficient way to revisit material you need help on. Trust me it is a blessing. Anyway good luck! Esp to the fyreflies <3. A note about pre–reqs: The only thing need from 1b is integration by parts,  a basic understanding of series (none of the geometric stuff ust be able to know what it means at a high level lol), and derivatives obviously.

Dusty is/was perhaps the greatest professor in the math department but he's leaving Harvard, so I definitely suggest you shop it next year, but don't commit right away bc the class might not be as good.I write this review with a bit of a bitter taste in the back of my throat.  Not because the class was bad –– it is perhaps the greatest math class I've taken here so far and has reignited a love for the subject I thought lost in the abstraction and pedantism of definitions and theorems in analysis ––  but because Dusty is leaving at the end of this semester, so he will *not* be teaching the class ever again (or any other at Harvard). This leaves me at a bit of a crossroads: I can review this semester, which has been flawless, but I also know everyone uses the Q Guide to judge subjects they haven't yet taken for future semesters, so I would like to tell you to take the following with a grain of salt, since **everything is subject to change (but hopefully will not)**.This class is great. Moderate–to–high workload (9–12hr/wk if you want to really do the PSETs well and deeply understand the material), but it creates such a good community that PSETting feels like hanging out with friends during office hours (because it kind of is). This also does not sacrifice a rigorous treatment of the material at hand, and I definitely feel prepared to take higher upper–level math classes (112,122, etc) both from a mathematical preparation and proof–writing skill point of view. PSETs are also interesting and explore cool cracks in the definition that may otherwise slip through (why does Clairaut's Theorem only hold for C^2 functions? Are there functions that are not integrable but still have a definite integral?), and office hours are spread out appropriately throughout the week (shoutout Alice and Anamaria for the GOAT conjoined office hours on Sunday afternoons).Grading is pretty chill. 60% of your grade is determined by 3 midterms, which were fair in difficulty and you were given problems to adequately practice on, so no worries there. Another 20% is homework, 5% is computational exercises, and the final 15% is the final project that we have in lieu of a final exam (and it is so much more fun and takes so much pressure off of finals week, 100% recommended) where you can explore whatever you want provided it has rigorous treatment of multivariable calculus and algebra.DEFINITELY shop this class, and I really hope the next professor is good, because they will have big, big shoes to fill.",0.9969,Too bad dusty is leaving :(,-0.7506,"Best freshman math course you can take.

While this made the class significantly easier, and I definitely spent less time on it than 25a, it was still a difficult course, especially at the very beginning and very end of the semester. I still thus recommend taking 25b, even if you have previous analysis experience. For me specifically, when I took analysis in high school I didn't have a great linear algebra background, and I lost a lot of the intuition and appreciation for the material that I was able to gain in 25b. The course is an incredible deep–dive into real analysis, and you come out of it with a very good understanding of the fundamentals. Notably, if you're thinking of taking 55b, that course doesn't cover real analysis in nearly as much depth––from what I heard, they spent a week on it. Additionally, at least with Wes, he made sure that we got computational practice and worked with applications quite a bit, so for a non–pure math concentrator I feel like this class might be more useful than 55b.The intensive nature of this class and the small size made the community very strong. While I feel like it was accentuated with our specific teaching staff, I think that this is probably a constant for 25. For 90% of the class, it was basically impossible to complete the problem sets without at least some (and often a lot of) collaboration. You often found at least 12–15 people of the 20 person class at Tuesday night office hours. These office hours are some of my favorite memories of my freshman year, not just because of Saint Knut, the CA for those office hours, but also due to the fervent communal energy that would often last late into Wednesday morning. It was a truly collaborative atmosphere––everyone contributed, and everyone benefited. All of these qualities made the class feel more like a seminar–style class than a classic lecture–based one in terms of the tight–knit community that formed. Adding to the fact that most of us had taken 25a and had known each other since the beginning of freshman year, I can't think of a better class in terms of community. I'm serious: especially for STEM majors, you're not gonna get better than this.Wes:A gem among gems. Potentially the best teacher I've ever had, and definitely the best math lecturer. I assume this applies to any class he teaches, so this almost certainly applies if you're considering taking 19a, 118r, or some other class that he's teaching. His lectures are sometimes transcendental experiences, Picard–Lindelof proof in particular. (I'm not joking––I was literally dreaming about how beautiful the proof was the night after the lecture.) His enthusiasm for the material, particularly 25b material, is obvious and so infectious. He made the class feel like a journey––with the Picard–Lindelof proof, for example, he hyped up that proof specifically for weeks before we got to it, and when he finally proved it in class, the way so many of the concepts we had been learning about fit together so perfectly in the proof was just beautiful. He forces us to participate in lectures, and in a very constructive way that, combined with the clarity and deliberateness of his lecturing, made if feel like I could have proved the given proposition or theorem myself if I was given enough time. He also clearly and genuinely cares about his students, hosting numerous office hours and making himself available to schedule individual appointments whenever. His (sometimes intentional, sometimes not) humor also added to the lecture experience. Yes, it's a 9am three days a week, but it was so worth it. Wes does have a few annoying principles that he sticks to very stubbornly: the worst of these is absolutely no flexibility in deadlines (like if you submit something five minutes late you might get a zero). The exams are also in person and quite difficult, although if you study from the problem sets and lecture notes they're usually doable. All in all, the 25 sequence, including 25b, was one of my favorite and most memorable experiences from freshman year. Both 25a and 25b were my favorite classes each semester, due in part to the interesting material, but much more due to the fantastic people in the class, the community and the wonderful teaching we were privileged to experience. I got a little emotional at the end of the final lecture.

If you took Math 55a you are most definitely prepared to take on this class. We also had I think about 4 students from Math 25a and 2 students from Math 22.Based on my experience and other friends’ feedback it feels that Math 55b was a decent bit easier than Math 55a and that in some sense last semester was the “real Math 55 experience.” Last semester we were forced to work together on hard problems for a long time and go to office hours for help, and as a result, we formed a close community and had a deeper understanding of the materials. To some extent this semester we had the continuation of that community but personally, I felt like I understood last semester’s material better and had more interactions with the CAs and just everyone in the class.This course is titled ""Studies in Real and Complex Analysis,"" but on the first day of class, the professor explains to you that in reality, it is more like Math 131+Math113. We roughly had three units: 3.5 weeks on point set topology, 3.5 weeks on algebraic topology, and 5 weeks on complex analysis. As a result, we don’t really dive into real analysis and students should learn this important area of mathematics on their own at some point.We followed Munkres’ Topology through the first two units. In point set topology we learned about fundamental concepts such as product and quotient topology, connectedness, compactness, and separation axioms, which is Munkres chapter 12–34. So I would recommend future students who want to do some preparation during winter break to read this portion of Munkres. This part of the course was comparably more intuitive and chill (admittedly compactness is not very intuitive).In algebraic topology, we learned about homotopy equivalences, fundamental groups, Seifert–Van Kampen, covering spaces, and briefly introduced topics like higher homotopy groups and homology. This is roughly Munkres chapters 51–57 and 79–81. This part of the course was quite difficult for me as it is harder to visualize and see the significance of these constructions. Later on, after learning complex analysis, I was finally able to see some of the motivations and applications of these concepts. Definitely try to go to office hours here, for me at least the problem sets involve a degree of hand waving and many drawings.About a week after spring break we started Complex Analysis, which according to Professor Harris is his favorite and most beautiful part of the course (as usual Joe is an absolutely fantastic and supportive lecturer). Here we followed Ahlfors’ Complex Analysis, which honestly is quite terse and hard to understand (reading lecture notes beforehand helps). We started with holomorphic functions and with the introduction of the Cauchy Integral Formula we were equipped to take on harder problems. After learning about poles, singularities, and Laurent series, we did a good amount of Residue calculus which gave us important results about holomorphic and meromorphic functions.I have to admit, I personally did not find complex analysis to be particularly enlightening as it felt like learning a ton of cool formulas and then just applying them to solve some seemingly arbitrary problems. In retrospect, I actually liked the topology portion of the course better as they introduced new ideas I have never considered before. I will likely take Math 231, a course Professor Harris highly recommended.From my perspective my classmates took the following courses alongside 55b: quite a few took CS 124, a decent amount took Stat 111, some took Math 123 or 129 or 132, and a few took CS 181.Throughout this semester I have been thinking hard on what the point of taking Math 55 is. If a student took courses that taught the materials in 55 separately they may get a deeper understanding by virtue of spending more time on them. I have come to a few humble conclusions: I think by compressing a large amount of abstract mathematics into each semester we do get a slightly more surface–level understanding of individual topics. However, at the same time, we got to see some connections between different areas of mathematics that would be otherwise hard to see, for example, algebra with topology, complex analysis with algebraic topology, abstract algebra with linear algebra; and I’m sure some of the smaller topics we did like the exposure to basic category theory will serve us well in the future. I think I got a very solid overall “feel” and overview of higher–level mathematics. Moreover, 55 is really at its core about the community. I have met some of my closest friends and some of the most interesting people through this class. The late nights at Math Lounge and Math Library will forever be a sweet piece of memory lying in the foundation of my Harvard journey and I’m sure years later my classmates and I will look back fondly on those days and laugh and shed some tears. I highly recommend anyone reading this to reach out to your classmates, schedule a lunch or a walk together and get to know them better. You will not regret this.Overall I think continuing with 55b was the right choice for me and most of my classmates from 55a. If you are considering this course, sit in on a few lectures and check it out! I wish you the best of luck!",0.9991,"You will fall behind in this course no matter what! (except if you already know most of the concepts in this class) This is because every lecture you are introduced to a handful of definitions and another handful of theorems, just to build up on those concepts two days later. Every lecture you are expected to be familiar with all the concepts taught so far in the course, which is not realistic at all, given that we meet three times a week, that the psets already take us anywhere between 10 and 20 hours, given that the lectures are already confusing and it takes time to review them and ask questions, and lastly given that you also have other courses. Harris is a very kind person in real life, but when it comes to teaching you will feel very stupid because he always says things are so obvious when they aren't. You will feel impostor syndrome because the professor acts as if the proofs are so obvious so he will skip plenty of steps, and he will never remind you of any definitions unless you ask, but then nobody asks, because it is not a very welcoming evironment. This class is just unnecessarily hard and time–consuming. Also we only got feedback for 2 psets out of 10 until the last week of classes when we learned the rest of our grades on the psets and the final, and you also never see any solution of either the psets of the final, so you just hardly ever improve from your mistakes.",-0.9058,,0.0,112871,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Mathematics,Mathematics,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Section

I'd like to preface everything by saying I think Janet Chen is an awesome and really kind person though. At the very beginning of the course, some of the things you do will feel very strange. Writing a proof is a very particular skill and if you've never done it before, it can feel sort of unusual. My advice at the beginning would be to practice, practice, and practice more! Really work hard at the beginning to fully understand what is going on—it will serve you well for the remainder of the course. One thing you might notice early on though is that some people have stronger backgrounds in proof writing than others. I was sometimes working with people during problem sessions who knew what things like ""Without loss of generality"" were and it felt discouraging to be writing proofs with people who already knew all of the steps and the general formulation of the proof. I think if this course wants to fully serve as an intro to proof based math, it needs to be designed particularly for people with absolutely no proof experience. Knowing how to write a proof is essential to this course and having knowledge of that prior to the course is a huge disadvantage for other students. The anti–requisites should be more enforced in order to make sure all students have an equal background coming into the course. In terms of the grading of the course, I think that an intro course should really focus on growth and allow people the opportunity to progress as the semester goes on (some course have this built in to how the course is scored). It at times did not feel like there was this emphasis on the grading for the course. In fact, I'm of the belief that an intro to pure math course should be scored in a way that is encouraging for students to continue to take challenges and take more pure math courses, but it often did not feel like this was the case. The grading at times felt like it was very strict and nitpicky and there weren't a lot of opportunities to earn points back (on the problem sets there was, but I think on the exams there should have been). Having the opportunity for extra credit would be an awesome idea for a course like math 101 where people are so new to what is being taught. The final paper in particular felt like an illustration of the course instructors being unnecesarily strict with their expectations. Firstly, it's a lot to ask students to write a math paper and take a math final. In addition to this, the paper was graded with a really high standard which felt unfair because this put students who had knowledge of math topics outside of the course at a clear advantage. Also, the paper was the first time a lot of us ever wrote a pure math paper, so grading it so strictly without at least having multiple rounds of edits or multiple opportunities to conference or even a practice paper earlier in the semester feels like an unfair expectation. I know that grades shouldn't be the foremost concern when deciding what courses to take, but I think people should take challenges and do things like take a pure math course as a non–math concentrator. In order to incentivize people to do this, you need to create a course centered around growing and one that eliminates inequities that can exacerbate the challenges and frustrations that come along with the course. One other thing I'd note are that it's pretty frustrating to have timed exams in a course like math 101. I think proof writing takes time and I often felt like there was time pressure on the exam, and this made things more challenging. I know a lot of this has been about some of the ways this course can be improved, so I just wanted to take the opportunity to highlight some of the positives of this course. Firstly, it will likely challenge you in ways you've never been challenged. This is a good thing! It is a rewarding intellectual experience to think through a lot of the problems in the course. Secondly, the course staff is great! Janet is a great person and explains concepts very clearly. The CAs are awesome—try out all the CA's office hours and find which CAs you most vibe with / understand their teaching style. Doing this as early in the semester will definitely benefit you. Overall, I would say I definitely enjoyed learning a lot of the concepts in math 101 and am glad to have faced a challenge with the course material. My TLDR of where I think this course can improve is: make sure this is really at the intro level, eliminate inequities by being stricter about the anti–requisites, create a culture that makes people want to continue taking higher level math classes and challenge themselves. If you're really excited about this course material and willing to put in the effort this course requires, definitely don't let these concerns stop you since math 101 can be a rewarding experience.",0.9993,"don't take this class. especially not with janet. she's absolutely overhyped and not at all a great teacher. she doesn't have empathy and has policies that literally make negative sense. i don't think this class is worth the stress. the content is interesting, but you have to learn it yourself. overhyped prof and course. learned that higher level maths is cool, but class was not taught well at all.",-0.3331,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

Math 113 is an epic voyage through these exciting theorems––I learned something interesting in literally every lecture––which will broaden your mathematical perspective and leave you with a deep appreciation for math.I recommend having taken real analysis at the level of Math 22b, Math 25b, or Math 112 before taking this course, because complex analysis borrows many techniques (epsilon–delta) and theorems from real analysis, and these techniques will not be covered as deeply in 113 as in these other courses. Real analysis is also important to appreciate the subject––complex functions behave in very surprising ways, but this won’t come as much of a surprise without learning how they “normally” behave on the real numbers. This is definitely not necessary, but I also found Math 131 as a good course to take before 113 because we rely on some topological techniques in 131 (mainly homotopies of paths). Since 131 is not assumed as a prereq, these topological concepts will be covered during lecture, but having a background in topology will let you see the “big–picture” connection between complex analysis and topology, giving you a deeper understanding and appreciation for the subject. You’ll also gain this insight by taking 113 –> 131, since 131 also references some complex analysis to illustrate certain topics (Riemann sphere as one point compactification of C, for example).",0.9961,,0.0,,0.0,113608,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Mathematics,Mathematics,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Section

I barely understood the details on surgery, especially the interplay between global and local properties in cobordism and surgery, but it was pretty cool nonetheless. he also compensates for his horrible blackboard work with absolutely amazing pictures, which surely is core in any class on topology/geometry. you can always tell a good geometer/topologist by the way he draws donuts, especially 2 donuts stacked on top of each other and intertwined, which eventually turned into a picture of a meditating buddha by the time hopkins was done using the picture. finally and most importantly,  quirky is an understatement for hopkins' personality. i dont think any other professor here is as cool and in touch with young students as he is. the antics that he pulls during class are so weird that they become hilarious and endearing. highlights include his habit of trying to spin the blackboard duster while throwing it behind his back onto the blackboard at the start of every lesson, claiming that his lecture quality will drop because his thumb hurts due to playing too many console games with his daughter last night, and also his profound insight of using the famous lemma stating that 1+1 = 2 in the middle of a proof (this eventually made it onto sidechat). overall, a solid class for people who come to class to be entertained but are prepared to put in the work outside of class, because you wont learn much during lectures. his notes are amazing (full of typos though, but he likes to put his inner ramblings inside his notes so you can occasionally see him complaining some details he has to straighten out in his notes). in addition to gaining a deeper appreciation for how cool and beautiful diff top is, even though i understand close to zero of it still, i also gained an appreciation for how cool some mathematicians are. definitely a recommendation if you are insane like me. oh btw, he likes steifel manifolds and grassmanians alot for some strange reason. the psets are full of them",0.9985,"Prof. Hopkins's lectures were some of the most entertaining lectures I've heard – he often goes on long tangents that make the class more entertaining and personal. However, it sometimes seemed that he didn't prepare much for the class; proofs and definitions presented in lecture were often disorganized, and problem sets were released sporadically toward the end of the course. In total, the course was fairly light (short problem sets + no exams), though I'm hesitant to say that I learned much through the course of the semester.Part of this is also driven by the extremely wide range of backgrounds that students have heading into the course. There were some students who had no experience with analysis, abstract algebra, or topology, while others had just finished Math 231a. I think that trying to accommodate such a wide range of backgrounds occasionally got in the way of learning. Some of the topics in differential topology seem difficult to understand without at least a rudimentary understanding of some math topics, and sometimes the course awkwardly balanced between explaining content without topics with other math courses and incorporating topics from other math courses.Overall, while this course was an easy way to fulfill the topology requirement, I think that it had the potential to teach much more than it did, and I'm not sure I would have taken it knowing what I know now.",-0.6784,,0.0,123212,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Mathematics,Mathematics,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Section

He's a very patient and kind teacher, and he is always going out of his way to help students and advocate for them. He also stayed late during office hours consistently and made sure every student was at a good stopping point by the end of his office hours session. His lectures are really fun and engaging. You can tell that he really loves what he's teaching and loves teaching in general by the way he explains things. Also, as a math and CS concentrator, I thought that Lean was soooo cool. You get to use code to write math proofs! It was like two worlds colliding for the first time. I might have written my thesis on theorem provers if I had taken this class junior year instead of senior year. I could not recommend this class enough. It completely changed my perspective on what math could be and left me with incredible memories and friends. Phil really did a great job of cultivating a community, and connecting with the people in the class makes it so much easier to connect with the material too. Also the assignments were super instructive but also accessible. The problems on the homework were actually based off of the topics and examples we covered during lecture. Both of the projects were so fun, interesting, and personally meaningful. I felt like I learned so much from them. I also appreciated that there were no exams. It took way the sense of impeding doom I sometimes feel during a semester. It made it so much easier to focus on and invest in what we were learning as well as who we were learning the material with.

The projects are very open–ended – especially if you're a procrastinator or you don't have a lot of experience with programming, get started early, go to office hours, and make sure to pick something that works well in Lean. It can be easy to get stuck in a project which is not fun and also really hard to implement formally.

The only graded parts are a final project proposal due in April and a final project due in May. It is a graduate math class that is also suitable for being a fifth class. You may learn some coding skills and get to know some interesting people in grad schools like the business school and the med school in the final project.This is not a class without its downsides. I don't think I learned that much from the class nor would I retain much, but it was fun hearing some speakers talking about what makes them passionate and Nowak is an important figure in mathematical biology. If you want to take a class to learn something deeply and have a strong class community, this might not be for you; but if you want an enjoyable survey class with low stress and is a grad math class, this is a great class to take.Overall I enjoyed the class and am grateful for meeting my final project teammates that I may otherwise have not met, though I do have ambivalent feelings about this class and would not recommend it to everyone.",0.988,,0.0,,0.0,119511,Primarily for Graduate Students,Mathematics,Mathematics,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Section

Here's the rundown, but be aware that the class is going to be taught by a different professor next year so I don't know how much of this will still apply.Lectures: Decent to good, it really depends on the lecturer so it may be different, but they weren't bad. Dr. Berry and Dr. Sabeti each had their styles of lecturing that were both more engaging than just sitting in a hall listening to someone talk for an hour, which was nice. They put up these questions which you just had to answer for attendance, but other than that, they're a good way to get the general idea of what you're going to be learning in any given week, with some examples sprinkled in. Pay attention to the examples that they give, a fair amount of this class is (kinda surprisingly) based in some math and statistics, so seeing problems being worked through will come in handy on the PIEs(more on those later).Lecture notes: There are these notes published weekly alongside the lecture slides, READ THEM. Go through, take notes, make sure you understand everything in the lecture NOTES. Anything in there is fair game, and sometimes there are details that aren't in the slides, so if you want to do well, use them. Heck, you could probably get through the class on those alone, as long as you also make sure you know how to do some simple stats calculations. Lab: So once a week, you go into a lab room, do an experiment or part of an experiment, clean up, fill out some info for a lab report, and repeat. That part's pretty fun if you're into biology, what sometimes sucked is when we had a multi–week experiment where something went wrong in the beginning and we had to use sample data for the whole thing, but yeah. If you're coming from ls1a, be warned that there are also a few lab papers you'll have to write throughout the semester, where you have to find scientific articles and then do a write–up on a specific gene or bacteria. It's very formulaic, they tell you what to include though, so it's not hard just time–consuming.Exams: Good news, ls1b doesn't have midterms. Bad news, it has these things called PIEs instead. Instead of 1–2 midterms, you have 5 min–exams that are 40 minutes each, and you get to drop the lowest one. I'm not sure what they were like in past years, but coming from someone who did pretty well on them, they did NOT calibrate the difficulty correctly. Half the class barely passed the first one, and they weren't much better moving forward. You're expected to write way too much for the time they give you, and any short–response question is graded on whether you include 1 or 2 specific details about the question topic, so you end up just writing everything you know in the box and hoping for the best. They let you take a single page of notes into each one too, but there isn't time to really use it, and some questions are oddly specific so you still have to write mostly everything on it in order to answer those questions. Be prepared if you're going to take this class. The final exam was pretty fair though, so credit where credit is due.Homework: Classic PSET course, not much different from ls1a's PSETs if you did those. Get a weekly document, answer questions, go to office hours, work with other people, etc. Definitely get a good PSET group together if you're not already planning on taking this class with other people you know. Halfway through the semester, they reduced the number of PSETs, but that just meant they took half of the remaining PSETs and merged them with the other half, so each one was twice as long instead. In terms of difficulty, very hit or miss, some would be pretty straightforward and then others would take hours to figure out.So...yeah, that's about it. The content was actually pretty interesting, there's even a little bit of disease genetics and virology if that's what you're into (I was, which made it fun), and overall it wasn't bad – though, having friends also taking it and being able to study together and all that definitely helped.

Prof. Nelson accomplishes so many things at once: he integrates knowledge from a wide range of STEM fields in a way that remains accessible to undergraduates, 2) he presents coursework that is mathematically rigorous (challenging enough to be fun) but still steps back to consider the bigger picture (large–scale, conceptual, macroscopic ideas). The material covered in this course strips back the nitty gritty of the life sciences to the basics and allows you to peer into the ways in which each field builds upon and informs the next (statistics in understanding entropy, thermodynamics in understanding mechanics, mechanics in understanding biochemical/molecular behavior, etc.). Richard is also an amazing TF; he explains everything so clearly! If you take this course, lectures and section are both optional, but highly recommended; they're super helpful, but they won't affect your grade, so no stress about that. The psets can be a slight bit challenging but rarely were they too frustrating and there's also a lot of extra credit; either way, just go to office hours and Richard will make everything make so much more sense.

The content is extremely interesting and engaging, while not being too challenging. Professor Abbate has a very careful, intentional way of speaking, and everything she says during lecture feels extremely relevant and interesting. The lectures covered both the history of opera, as well as the effects of different stagings and analysis of short sections of opera. The assignments for this class come in the form of 6 listening responses and 4 portfolio essays. The listening responses were short (300 words) papers about a section of 1–2 minutes of opera music where we wrote about what we heard in the music and libretto, and how this tied to what we were covering in lecture. They were short and chill –– they had a time limit of an hour but I usually spent about half an hour on them. The portfolio essays were longer (1000 words) essays analysing a specific opera or about our personal experience writing opera. They were also nice, they usually took me 2–4 hours, and they were pretty fun to write! Other than that, there were about 30 pages of reading and 30–60 minutes of opera viewing assigned each week, but I could usually get the main ideas without doing the whole reading. I really enjoyed sections as well –– they were a good way to remember everything from lecture, discuss upcoming assignments, and have cool discussions about opera. All in all, I really enjoy this course, and I strongly recommend it to anyone with even the slightest interest in opera who has space for a chill and fun class in their schedule.",0.9953,Be aware that there is some basic music theory and singing knowledge assumed.

If you didn't take 51a and know a decent amount of music theory, I think you should take this course, just to give music theory at Harvard a try. It's not miserable, but it's not amazing. One warning is that the lectures are kind of convoluted. His teaching style isn't the most organized or clear, so I would often times have to try to relearn everything from the handouts he gave us. Another warning is that this is not a composition class. The clear focus is on analyzing music, not writing it. Many of the skills cross over, but just keep in mind that composing is not what the course is meant to teach you. I found this frustrating at times, because I don't like analyzing music, but if you enjoy analyzing music maybe you're chilling. Homework isn't that bad, maybe 2–3 hours a week, plus the two projects. The last project is a three minute composition , which I really think we should spend more time on workshopping at the end of the semester to get those pieces as good as possible, but like I said, this isn't a composition class. This semester the professor tried integrating some concepts that were not just western classical music, which was really cool and I respect the idea, but I don't think it was executed that well, but I bet next time he'll know how to teach it better.  Don't let this negative review deter you, just know that it's not for everyone. A lot of people I think really did like this class.",0.9923,,0.0,,0.0,125213,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Music,Music,,Arts and Humanities,,Lecture,Section

I get students coming in late is not ideal, but nagging them all class about it is not a welcoming learning environment anyone wants to be in.

Hard to keep track of all of these ""smaller pieces"" and easy to mess up your grade just because there are so many moving bits you can lose track of. There should be more ""big assignments"" that are longer term and less assignments overall.  3) Lecture is not engaging and does not review course material effectively. The disconnect between the textbook, lecture and quizzes is large. Also, does not utilize more innovative technology or resources out there.  I was really bored, it just wasn't fun. 4) Feedback not helpful sometimes.5) Hard to access office hours w/course staff sometimes––I recommend calendly or something. 6) The class felt speaking heavy over writing heavy––there was a lot more speaking practice than writing practice. 7) In–class activities did not capture different levels of learning. The amount of time given for writing practice in class was sometimes not enough for some to complete their work. Lack of in–class resources other than the professor himself to assist struggles also did not help.8) Professor hovers too much over your in–class activity, you can't take a breath without him watching you in class, it's too suffocating.

Ustaadh Richard is a fantastic and amazingly dedicated instructor, and it's evident to me that I've made significant strides in my Arabic abilities over the course of this class, as well as that that improvement is due in large part to the patience and care that Ustaadh Richard and Alaa Aldeen, our TF, took in their lesson planning, assignments, and extensive feedback.  They both consistently went above and beyond in terms of their dedication to this class, and it was obvious that each lesson was intentionally thought out so as to be as useful as possible to our learning.  Additionally, because students start from different ability levels , the class is largely participation based, which put some of the fun back into doing my work.

Lectures are posted so it makes it very easy to go back to them if you need to reference something particular for the papers.The assignments are straightforward and  fair. The prompts that Prof. Sagha posts help you start thinking critically about the material and are very helpful in getting you started on the paper.

Gonzalo is really kind to everyone and he wants everyone to succeed, but he also clearly has favoritism towards underclassmen (2 people literally joined his lab by the end of the semester), which made all the seniors in our class feel a bit left out, as though we were being discounted as not being worth investing in from the get–go.

I think that some of the math gets really complicated with partial differential equations + everything, but they mostly abstract it away, so you don't really have to be able to derive anything. I think the first exam was fair + very similar to the psets, and the second exam was much more difficult (at least the first question was much more difficult) as the content covered was also a bit more involved mathematically + statistically. Definitely try to understand the psets, whether before or after they are due, and pay attention in lecture!!

I've only taken eight courses at Harvard so far, but this has been my favorite one, with Math 101 being a close second.Every component of this course was wonderful. Professor Simmons' lectures are engaging, exciting, clear, and I genuinely only checked my phone a couple of times during lecture across the entire semester. They were that captivating.Almost all of the readings were extremely doable, roughly 1–2 hours per reading/class (so, 2 or 3 times per week). More than doable, the readings were like the lectures—engaging and exciting. Not always clear, but that's what the lectures are for!Office hours were one of my favorite aspects of the course; I liked them so much that I ended up going to almost every one I could physically attend. I sometimes came with questions prepared, either about concepts I wanted to clarify further or curiosities that went beyond the lecture. Sometimes, though, I just showed up ready to hear what other people had to ask about/say. Because it's an intro class, office hours had people from all (prospective) concentrations—physics, neuro, math, philosophy, and more. This made them a million times better, since everyone would bring their own unique perspective (either based on their concentration or other interests) to the discussion.Finally, assignments were extremely manageable and rewarding. The courses is not too writing–intensive. You will write no more than a total of 3,000 words across the entire semester, split up into four short (250–500 word) essays and one longer (1,250 word) essay.I had always been slightly interested in philosophy, but I had never done much reading before, and I had not read a page of metaphysics. I was totally fine, and came out of the class loving metaphysics, wanting to take as many more philosophy courses as possible, and potentially concentrate.DO take this class if you:– Have no background in philosophy– Have some background in philosophy– Have a lot of background in philosophy– Are curious about philosophy– Are not curious about philosophy– Have read any/most/all of the readings in the syllabus (yes, even you! You'll get so much out of Professor Simmons lectures and office hours)– Are a first–year, sophomore, junior, senior, grad student, or any other kind of learner– Are concentrating in philosophy– Are not concentrating in philosophy– Are curious about the world around you– Are curious about what it means to be you– Haven't taken it before(Maybe) DON'T take this class if you:– Have taken it before (honestly, you could still get a bunch more out of it a second time)Disclaimer #1: this class is geared to people who are totally new to philosophy, so if you've read a bunch of metaphysical Descartes, Hume, or Kant before, some of the information might be redundant. However, this introductory–mindedness allows you to get as much out of the class as you put into it. If you just go to lecture and section without doing any of the readings or going to office hours, you'll still get a bunch out of the class. However, you will get so, so much more if you do all (or most, like me!) of the readings and go to office hours with questions or just to listen to other peoples' thoughts.Disclaimer #2: be prepared to rethink everything you thought you knew about the world around you and what it means to be you.At this point, I realize I have not given enough credit to Professor Simmons. From day 1, she was the most compassionate, understanding, funny, and smart professor I have had here so far (or ever in my life, most likely). She genuinely cares about all of her students, and entertained all of our questions no matter how silly or off–topic.I truly cannot praise this class, or Professor Simmons, enough.The ONE thing I didn't love about this course were the three lectures (Sor Juana, Poullain, and Astell) in which it was clear that Professor Simmons was not totally clear on the thinker's concepts herself. The lectures were still good, but at times she tripped over her words and admitted that she wasn't exactly sure what the thinker meant about something. The great part about this is that the next time she teaches Phil 8, she will surely be more comfortable and confident with these lectures!P.S. Shoutout to our TF, Luke Ciancarelli—he probably won't TF this course again, but he was part of what made this class special.",0.999,,0.0,Excellent course. Prof Simmons is an absolute gem of a professor and the TF Luke was fantastic as well. This course was a great introduction to philosophy. It is great at teaching how to read more carefully and write with more precision and clarity. I don't think it would be an exaggeration to say that this course changed the way I think – about philosophy but also science.,0.8928,,,,,,,,,

When people talk about how they took a class and it changed their life, I thought that was total BS. But this class truly did that for me. The readings –– if you do them, which you should, they're worth it –– make you think about your values. Why you have them, are they good values to have. Especially recommend if you feel like you're going through the motions in classes, and you are searching to actually learn something meaningful. And learn something that matters. This was the first philosophy class I've ever taken, and it was extremely accessible and easy to understand. I feel like I have a better grasp on analyzing the people around me and their values, as well as my own. Why I want to be a good person. So many important questions that we should all ask ourselves.

You will not do well on the response papers if you don't have previous experience or don't write for The Crimson. In fact, I was told by the professor to approach the application papers as a good editorial piece from The Crimson. While this is great, it does not help when that is not your strength. I have never felt worse about myself as a student and writer. ALSO, there is only one correct interpretation of the philosophy and papers. If yours does not align with the TF, your grade will suffer.  While the teaching staff is readily available, they do not provide actual help. Instead, it's a lot of fluff but leaves you to figure out the rest even when you express feeling lost or not familiar with the writing. THE GRADING IS SUPER HARSH!Basically:– boring lectures– harsh grading– experience in philosophical writing REQUIRED– waste of your timeThe section discussions with other students is the only thing going for the class",-0.7706,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

Section and lecture were dynamic and really helpful for strengthening and extending my understanding. Readings were very interesting and a reasonable length.This was my first course in philosophy, and I loved it.Also, I really liked how this course used empirical (quantitative) evidence when it was relevant and did not use it when it was not relevant (i.e., data from our unideal world may not be generalizable to an ideal–world philosophical argument). I had been wondering how to relate empirical evidence with philosophy, and I think this course handled it well.I learned how to build a rigorous framework and theory for social justice, how to consider objections to a theory of justice, and how to extend and challenge a theory of justice. In essence, I learned how to think holistically about inequalities in our society and whether they are just or unjust. This was exactly what I hoped to learn from this class, and I am so grateful.

Even if one or two midterms go poorly, you will have the opportunity for redemption. If you are pre–med and looking to fulfill the second semester physics requirement, this is definitely a difficult course, and you'll need to set aside ample time for studying and course work. I did not take AP50B, but I have heard that it is a good alternative to this class. However, Tim (preceptor), Gabriel (head TF), Dagim and the rest of the CAs and TFs are INCREDIBLE! They are so kind and helpful and are basically willing to do whatever to help you. Next year, I hope Tim does all the lectures. He explains this much more clearly and manages time more efficiently than Prof Franklin. I think Prof Franklin cares and tries hard, but her teaching is so confusing, and we never made it through a full lecture when she taught. Tim taught the back half of the course, and it was much better. In comparison to PS2, this class is much more difficult. Be prepared to go to office hours and do much more work than last semester. This class rewards effort. The more time you put in, the better you will perform. If you do the online section, PAY ATTENTION. Don't just click through and fast forward. Your learning will suffer and I found that if I paid attention during the section videos, I was able to grasp the material much better. I also recommend trying the section problems on your own before watching the videos. If you have to take this class, you got this!! Go to Tim or Gabriel for help if you need it.

I went into PS3 expecting it to be a continuation of PS2 which in some ways it was – useless and tedious labs, long problem sets, 2 midterms with the whole unnecessary group exam thing, etc. So format wise pretty similar.

Even if one or two midterms go poorly, you will have the opportunity for redemption. If you are pre–med and looking to fulfill the second semester physics requirement, this is definitely a difficult course, and you'll need to set aside ample time for studying and course work. I did not take AP50B, but I have heard that it is a good alternative to this class. However, Tim (preceptor), Gabriel (head TF), Dagim and the rest of the CAs and TFs are INCREDIBLE! They are so kind and helpful and are basically willing to do whatever to help you. Next year, I hope Tim does all the lectures. He explains this much more clearly and manages time more efficiently than Prof Franklin. I think Prof Franklin cares and tries hard, but her teaching is so confusing, and we never made it through a full lecture when she taught. Tim taught the back half of the course, and it was much better. In comparison to PS2, this class is much more difficult. Be prepared to go to office hours and do much more work than last semester. This class rewards effort. The more time you put in, the better you will perform. If you do the online section, PAY ATTENTION. Don't just click through and fast forward. Your learning will suffer and I found that if I paid attention during the section videos, I was able to grasp the material much better. I also recommend trying the section problems on your own before watching the videos. If you have to take this class, you got this!! Go to Tim or Gabriel for help if you need it. They are amazing and so kind!!",0.9972,"Oh boy do I have things to say about PS3. I took this class having done well in PS2 and liking the teaching staff despite not loving the subject matter. I went into PS3 expecting it to be a continuation of PS2 which in some ways it was – useless and tedious labs, long problem sets, 2 midterms with the whole unnecessary group exam thing, etc. So format wise pretty similar.

It is not exceedingly difficult, though, with all physics classes, certain concepts can be tricky at times. If you have a strong background in mechanics, special relativity, and vector calculus, you should not have much trouble with this course. The exams and finals are very kind and the grading is forgiving. This may not be the most stimulating physics course you take at Harvard, but it is in no ways bad. Of course, it also fulfills a concentration requirement. When it comes to the actual content of the class, I really enjoyed deriving magnetism through relativity, something that is outlined in Morin and Purcell's E&M textbook (the required text for the course). Of course, E&M can start to feel repetitive since there really are only so many E&M problems out there, but 15b will certainly give you a solid introduction to the material. I chose 15b over 153 since I hadn't done much E&M going into college, and though I think I would have enjoyed the rigor of 153 a bit more, 15b still covered plenty of relevant material. All in all, an enjoyable course and Carlos is clearly passionate about the material (I really recommend talking with them one on one! They're super cool!).",0.9896,"Dr. Arguelles is very enthusiastic about physics and willing to help, but they are not a very effective lecturer. Lecturers simply rehashed the material from readings with more confusing and less clear presentation. I don't think this is the biggest issue with lectures, but filling in the fill–in–the–blank notes is not as helpful as writing new notes on the board (as Dr. Morin did in Physics 15a). Also, they were not very good at understanding or answering students' questions, which (especially toward the beginning of the course when people paid enough attention to ask questions) led to uncomfortably long and unhelpful breaks in class. You need to attend lecture because there are in–class participation quizzes. (The main question was asking us to write a question about the lecture –– I would have preferred actual questions about the concepts. They experimented with ai–based comprehension of the questions –– I found this distracting and unhelpful and would have preferred to do physics questions.) I personally learned most of the material in the course from the book and sections. The class material is difficult but graded fairly. Psets can be hard and there are not quite enough office hours (Carlos' office hours were at 10–12 AM Mondays, which was particularly unhelpful.) Also many of the CAs tended to not be prepared for office hours and they tend to be monopolized by particularly zealous students in office hours. I did not find it helpful to go to office hours and wait for hours to answer a one–minute question. I took AP Physics C so had some preparation for the course, and I do think the course is doable with less preparation, but you'll have to identify the actually helpful sources of support and ways to learn that work for you, because I do not think Carlos' lectures will do that. A few bright spots: If Gemma is TFing the class again, attend her section. She is an incredible teacher and very generous with her time to answer questions. Also Jeffery's office hours are fantastic if he is CAing the class, he is a physics legend great at explaining the intuition and physical reasoning behind physics concepts.A lot of course communication is done on slack. Carlos is generally responsive but they sometimes did not respond to important questions. Midterms generally rehashed the problem sets. Practice midterms posted did not align well with the problems on the actual midterm (or the material we learned in the class). The final practice tests were more aligned with course content and the final included several questions from the practice tests. For all tests (midterms and final) there was a group portion. This helps your grade but I honestly did not find that it particularly helped my learning –– it was mostly just an annoyance to rehash all the problems. I would suggest making a shorter test with only the bonus–type problems (these were extra problems at the end of the group test). This would be more effort but it would be more helpful for learning to work on new problems. Lab was also very good. It is participation–based so watch out if you miss a few –– you'll have to make them up at the end of the class. However the participation based system greatly decreases the stress of the lab while still allowing a lot of learning. Anna and Gregorio are really great teachers.",-0.9693,,0.0,111896,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Physics,Physics,Yes,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Section

If you are more leaning towards the philosophy side, it won't be bad. Professor Barandes tries to make the class very accessible, even for people who are not in a STEM discipline.

The material you cover is challenging, but it is very interesting. We aimed to cover all of Griffiths' Introduction to Electrodynamics in one semester – this was an ambitious goal. This material is often taught as a two–course sequence at other universities, and so this class operated at quite a fast pace. I enjoyed it, but would have liked to spend more time on the applications at the end (chapters 9–12). Unfortunately, there is only so much you can squeeze into a semester, and so if you can't cover all of that material in depth, I'd still recommend reviewing it, because it's just super cool.In this class you cover a lot of really interesting and cool material. It starts with electrostatics, moves to magnetostatics, then we begin the electrodynamics, looking at EM waves and Maxwell's equations. It wraps up with applications such as waveguides, reflection, dipolar radiation, relativistic electrodynamics, and more. Lectures are fast, and so reading the textbook is a helpful review activity to solidify your understanding. Problem sets are also great for developing better intuition and understanding of the material.Make sure you are solid with multivariable calculus going in. I'd recommend being familiar with E&M at the level of AP Physics C: E&M before the course. I took this without having taken 15b, and found it manageable, but I know people who were glad to have taken 15b before, so if you're debating between the two, shop them for a bit. At the beginning they both cover electrostatics, so it should be relatively easy to switch from 153 to 15b if necessary for the first few weeks.Professor Philip Kim was wonderful. He is a very sweet and thoughtful man, and incredibly smart. Lectures are great. I was very impressed, after the first exam (which was brutally hard – many considered it the hardest exam they had ever taken), he solicited feedback from the class, and adapted. As a result, the class switched over to take–home exams. It's clear he really cares about his students and their success. He is very accessible outside of class, and always happy to talk.

The material covered in this course strips back the nitty gritty of the life sciences to the basics and allows you to peer into the ways in which each field builds upon and informs the next (statistics in understanding entropy, thermodynamics in understanding mechanics, mechanics in understanding biochemical/molecular behavior, etc.). Richard is also an amazing TF; he explains everything so clearly! If you take this course, lectures and section are both optional, but highly recommended; they're super helpful, but they won't affect your grade, so no stress about that. The psets can be a slight bit challenging but rarely were they too frustrating and there's also a lot of extra credit; either way, just go to office hours and Richard will make everything make so much more sense.

Pinker is definitely an interesting guy with controversial opinions (many of which I do not agree with), so it was interesting attending his lectures, especially since I have read his book in high school. Some of the weeks had particularly interesting content too (illusions, 3D, Emotions lectures), and Pinker does a great job with making lectures engaging with class wide activities. This class does overly focus on memorizing content rather than learning it, and I wish the questions asked on exams were not so specific to the direct facts mentioned on each lecture slide group. I would recommend taking this class pass/fail if you are interested in the content but don't want to overly focus on rote memorization and forcing very specific facts down your throat.",0.9921,"This was my biggest regret at Harvard.

Prof. Mitchell is awesome –– he's an engaging lecturer, includes his personal struggles/stories during lecture, and overall a really likable person which is always a plus. However, he is very committed to in–person lecture attendance so the lecture recordings are not distributed unless you are ill.

I'm glad to now have precise terms to describe concepts that I understood intuitively, but could just never name. One of the greatest things in the course that I personally enjoyed was the integration of personal reflection, particularly in the Final Thing. Not only did Professor Ullman give us freedom to do whatever we wanted for the final project, he also frequently made us think about decisions we've made and how its shaped us. I took the Final Thing as an opportunity to reflect on my personal growth and progress, and it was honestly one of the most insightful assignments I've ever had.

However, lectures were hard to follow (handwriting hard to follow; order of writing on blackboard was not left–to–right/top–to–bottom but more circular) and this made it difficult for doing scribe notes. Homework was only 3 problems and 15 points, and grading was inconsistent. You could make a computational error and lose one point. Or you could do half a problem but lose only one point. Or you could handwave an entire problem, not have your solution be correct, and still get full points. The inconsistent grading wouldn't have been a big deal if each homework wasn't worth only 15 points. Additionally, we used Ed for course announcements. But some important announcements (like section 0, office hour time changes, etc) were announced as posts, so you never got email notifications about them.

The rest of the class sat just watching the back–and–forth, with some people laughing; it was uncomfortable. Basically, it felt like there was a clear division between favorite students and ones that would either receive frustration or laughs (sometimes even from the TF) because they weren't speaking as fluently.Even the Professor and TF couldn't keep up with the schedule set in the syllabus, and this had a serious impact on grades and learning. The syllabus said that students would get a chance to turn in a second draft of their papers in order to work on what they struggled with and to receive some points back, but the class couldn't manage to get through everything that was originally scheduled; we didn't get a chance to write any second drafts (or work on what we struggled with, or receive points back...)

It has been my favorite class at Harvard so far and it has been THE ONLY CLASS that I have genuinely enjoyed going to every day. If you've already taken Italian 10, Italian 11 is essentially the same class in a barely different font. I had Katie as my TF and she is AMAZING!! She was always so enthusiastic everyday in class, and that enthusiasm naturally passed onto me! The course itself is graded super reasonably––the class should rarely be overwhelming. In class quizzes are suuuuper reasonable, and its much easier to do well than poorly. THAs are very similar to the ones in Italian 10, these just involve some minor research and reading short articles/watching short videos. The online VHL assignments can get a bit tedious at times, but they're very doable, and a really great learning tool. The final project is SOOO reasonable, and is especially helpful when you're likely overwhelmed with other finals. It helped us end the class on a low–stress good note :) You will also probably form closer relationships with your classmates if you take Italian 11 since you would have taken Italian for almost a year together! I definitely recommend having Italian movie nights with your classmates towards the end of the semester when you have to watch the assigned film (La Meglio Gioventu)!",0.9914,"I would say that you need to study and make an effort to understand the material, since there are a lot of different tenses that will become really confusing really fast if you don't take the time to learn what each is and when to use them.",-0.4754,,0.0,125061,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Romance Languages & Lit,Italian,,None,,Lecture,Section

I don't care if you've fulfilled your language requirement or if you are sick of the humanities. SPANSH 40 is an incredible class, and you should not miss out. If it's been a while since you've taken Spanish, please don't worry. I am an upperclassman who hadn't taken Spanish since high school. I was fine. You'll be fine, too. The class even covers the subjunctive, conditionals, etc., which levels the playing field and gives the people who need to brush up on their Spanish the opportunity to do so. Also, it's actually a good thing that the class meets three times a week because the class meetings are really fun and valuable to attend. Profe explained everything so clearly, and the in–class activities were highly interactive (a lot of small–group and full–group discussions and little icebreakers –– but not the awkward kind!). The discussions of the movies were quite rich. And I loved the grammar lessons; Profe used a lot of examples and gave us lots of opportunities to practice what we'd learned (through written exercises and through speaking), which I found SO helpful. Also, speaking of grammar lessons, Profe's slides organized the grammar we had to learn in a way that was very digestible.Moreover, the quizzes are not stressful to study for. If you do your homework and brush up on the grammar covered, you'll be more than fine.  And the oral exams are low stress as well. Just look at the prompts before going in. (I'd choose two, and Profe would have me discuss one of those two.)All of the composiciones were very interesting to write. I loved the prompts and was grateful that we had several to choose from. The short film was one of my three favorite final projects from my time at Harvard (and I say this as an upperclassman). It was so interactive, fun, and challenging. We wrote a script for a short film and brought it to life through acting, filming, and editing. (And yes, you can make yours funny. :))I loved the format of watching movies. Movies are so much more fun than readings. And the movies are REALLY GOOD. I was seriously absorbed in all of them. My favorites were Los colores de la montana, which explored war, corruption, and loss of innocence; Contracorriente, which explored identity, isolation, and loss; NO, which explored rhetoric and loss of innocence; and El secreto en sus ojos, which was filled with all sorts of crazy plot twists, explored the corruption in Argentina's government and police forces, and featured a fascinating scene in which a lawyer leveraged a suspect's fragile masculinity to get him to confess to a crime.The grammar discussed in the beginning of the class may seem familiar, but you'll get a lot better at using it. And for me, the grammar that was new entered the picture toward the middle and end of the course and was SO USEFUL. And you'll find a lovely community. :) You'll talk a lot with your classmates in class, and you'll learn a lot about them through participating in the aforementioned icebreakers.Some closing thoughts:–If a movie doesn't have closed captions, don't freak out. You'll understand more of it than you'd expect. :)–I had not taken a real humanities class in college before taking this one. Now, I want to take more.–The feedback you'll get on your work is SO VALUABLE.",0.9988,,0.0,,0.0,125014,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Romance Languages & Lit,Spanish,,Arts and Humanities,,Lecture,Section 001

The teaching team is also pretty hot and cold... either very buddy–buddy or kind of confrontational / weirdly on your back if you mess something up. In keeping with the not–on–the–syllabus assignments, it's also just generally disorganized–– random assignments might come via email the day before, and you won't have any grades in Canvas the whole semester. However, the cooking component is almost too good to pass up (6 cooking classes throughout the semester–– you'll make great Spanish food), the material is interesting on net, and it's not a huge amount of work. So, overall, if you don't mind logistical inconveniences and some wacky moments here and there, it's a solid course.",-0.0481,"This is an amazing class! Such a gem.

This was my first poetry class, and also my first poetry class in Spanish, and I believe that it was very accessible to me as I was provided with the necessary context and background required to read the anthology and formulate critical thoughts. There was a very interesting variety of authors and poems and I really enjoyed exposing myself to such works by choosing to take this class! I loved having the weekly freewheeling journal to be able to freely express my thoughts on the poems we read without worrying about a restricted format or structure.

The 2–hour, 45–minute lecture flies by, and you'll have the most fun in the course (and succeed) if you show up having at least done the readings. Your lingering questions and clarifications will be covered during lecture, section, and office hours. Matt is also incredible and helped us break down complicated concepts and readings on the board. Similar to Arthur, he encourages people to be active participants and respects what all of us have to say. Although the questions we were discussing are fundamental to our understanding of government and our relationship to it, classes felt like an extremely inviting place to take academic risks.The course is also a great introduction to what Social Studies will be like in terms of the questions asked and historical ground covered.

Levitsky is amazing and I loved writing the final paper. This is a class where you actually have to do the readings because of its small class size and the seminar being structured where Levitsky walks through the concepts in each reading one by one. I loved that it forced you to do the readings. However, I thought that the seminar part of the course could have connected concepts from reading slightly more and made you build upon concepts. Therefore, I did not get much out of the seminar portion when I did the readings in depth because it was just reviewing the concepts of the readings which felt a little elementary. But the reading list was spectacular, and I really enjoyed the topic. Also Levitsky is a character with so much knowledge. His expertise cannot be understated.

I find myself held back by the sheer number of small asssignments that are due throughout the week, and it’s hard to find the energy to do so many of these tasks that make the class overall feel like a nitpicky gened.

Dr Leah is also an enthusiastic and kind professor who truly has a deep understanding of the field and is very engaging to talk to and get to know.

Take a class in the Statistics Department. This class does not teach you about sociology in the slightest. Class time felt like a waste because lectures are a horrible and ineffective way to teach math. There was no in–class assistance in what was being taught, so you couldn't practice in real time what you were supposed to be learning. There was also a stupid extension rule where you can only use an extension once in the entire semester and it was a 48–hour one; it completely disregards what students actually needs since students can't control when they may need an extension since busyness or mental health or any other difficulty can happen at whatever point in a semester. This class has made me completely hate statistics and has ensured that I never use quantitative methods as a sociologist. I absolutely hated this class and I'm not the only one. The lecture slides as well were awful as they were completely full of words making reading them difficult, yet they somehow consistently lacked the proper words that were needed to understand the concepts when studying. This class needs a complete revolution with a new class materials, teaching actual sociology, revamping the curriculum, getting rid of the lecture format, and including time in class to practice the math that taught. I do not think I can properly express how angry this class made me over the semester and how utterly useless this class is in the larger scope of my sociological career.

But if you actually want to LEARN about data science, then I would suggest looking elsewhere. By far the most disappointing class I’ve taken at Harvard. Chris is fantastic, but the rest of the TFs are not very helpful and often make mistakes. Beyond this, they make condescending comments regarding how simple the mathematical computations are, but pressed to implement those computations are just as lost as the students. As a rule of thumb, if the teaching fellows cannot solve the problem, it probably should not be assigned to students. Skip the advanced section too unless you absolutely need to take it — again, an enormous amount of work for little payoff. Simply put, this class is an absurd waste of time. That’s not to say that there’s not useful insights provided in this class, but the cost is far greater than the payoff.

When you enter section and see the Ritwik wielding the chalk, you know that he will set straight the indifferent, cruel currents of the unsolicited game of life. Going to the RITwik's section was a RITual of seemingly unbounded possibilities, a nirvana... a sheer utopia perhaps, of learning. When the Ritwik was in the room, Classroom 705 turned into a Citadel of higher thought, a true intellectual haven. Each section was a symphony in its own right. Each lemma, example, and proposition was a separate element that combined and complemented each other in ways initially unclear, perhaps even contradictory to the senses. But only as time progressed, with the mystery of local asymptotics and ""Bayesian Statistics"" slowly unravelling, did one finally understand the true genius of Ritwik. Like a composer, or perhaps the coy mystery novelist, the Ritwik dangled the plot's conclusion forth of the student in a display of agonizing suspense. Only approaching the ringing of the bell did Ritwik reveal the connections and relations of each separate lemma and proposition, allowing the coalescence of each component to fuse into a glorious creation whose value is truly worth more than the sum of its parts. In this sense, the Ritwik's sections can only be compared to the greatest of human artforms: Rachmaninoff's 2nd, the Mona Lisa perhaps, and surely the myriad remakes of John WIcK movies.If the sections were the orchestra hall, then the office hours were the place of salvation. The ""homework"" assigned were tasks of Herculean proportions, but Ritwik was Hercules. The problems fell under his glance and cowered amid a swift slash of chalk. Their only remainder being the gentle sprinkling of chalkdust that fell gently to the ground, like the lingering mist after a summer storm. He was the beacon guiding us through the fog of ignorance towards truth; without his light, perhaps we would never have made it out of the mist, doomed to drift forever amidst the waves of unintellectualism.Here concludes the telling of the tales of Ritwik. But alas, why do I try? Try as I may, my words are but a loathsome depiction of the glorious truth.

I will highly recommend everyone to take the class; I have learnt so much from it! I think the biggest takeaway to succeed in the class is to actually go to office hours and not be afraid to raise questions or suggestions. Professor Liu is one of the most open–minded professors I have met in the school, and I am extremely grateful to get to learn more from him. The course materials are not extremely difficult, but it requires dedication and effort to understand. I realize some students might complain about the difficulties etc, but most of the time, these students never attend lectures, nor do they go to office hours, and come on, this is a graduate class.  All in all, I think Professor Liu is an amazing lecturer, and I have personally learnt a lot from this course, and sincerely think the materials taught in the class is extremely useful.",0.9855,"As someone who has taken many stat courses and enjoyed almost every one of them, Harvard truly has an amazing stat department. Jun Liu is really nice, but unfortunately, this course is the exception. If you need a Bayesian course, this is perhaps the only statistics topic where I would highly encourage you to look down the road to MIT. Note that my response may be somewhat biased to discovering I do not like Bayesian inference (though I did believe I would enjoy Bayesian inference before this course!). Pros of this course:1. You get simulation and modeling practiceCons of this course:1. Lectures are unengaging2. The course is disorganized3. Problem sets consist of problems taken straight from the BDA book. These problems are (1) vague and hard to approach without office hours, (2) often not pedagogical, and (3) often computational and felt like it was a waste of time. 4. Weekly problem sets with varying length5. Problem set feedback comes so late and then you’re surprised you were deducted for random points (that were not clear needed to be addressed) on a problem set you did a month ago (and which you might have lost points for multiple times because of vagueness).6. The pacing is really off. We spend over a month reviewing 110 and 111 (in a graduate course...) before moving on to other topics (which then are unfortunately not taught well).tldr; this class is a lot of pain for not much gain.

The structure seems like it might change if the class is offered again, so take with a grain of salt:–– First few weeks of the class were half English, half TDM. We read/watched The Exorcist and did presentations on certain aspects of it, and we would also have a speaker come most weeks to teach us something about theater, usually in a hands–on way. –– Last few weeks of the class were based around performances. We were put in small groups to make mini theatrical pieces that related to the exorcist in some way.  After the first one,  groups were shuffled and we made a new piece.  Over the last month, we would perform this new piece, get comments for how to improve it, and make those improvements for the following week until the final class.For people thinking about taking this class, I'd say that the first half is generally very good. Second half is much more of a toss–up, depending on how OK you are with making a theatrical piece with varying levels of guidance and then performing it several times and working with the same small group of people over the course of a month.",0.9526,"Take this class if you like horror, but not just horror movies – the history of performing horror and performance theory are discussed and can be difficult to understand to beginners.
