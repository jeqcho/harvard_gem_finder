I think there is hope and the course could be much better structured. But what I experienced was subpar. Having a class on this subject is incredibly important, which is why getting it right is important. There were few guided discussion questions and the conversations often led nowhere, stifling engagement with the text. The same people (overwhelmingly graduate students), spoke over and over again, and said few things of substance. The professor did not engage enough with the discussion to encourage critical thinking. Breakout sessions were not effective and wasted time, they had even less direction and would end quickly with students having nothing to say. There was no other structure to the course besides unguided discussion for three hours straight. This kind of experience turns people away from theory and academia and makes it seem like it has no purpose.The course assignments were very unclear. Because few to no requirements nor guidance was given, success in an assignment was nebulous, hard to understand, and hard to achieve. Additionally, because there were only two assignments, it was hard for students to learn from mistakes and improve. We had to  figure out for ourselves what a good paper looked like and what the staff was looking for. By the time we got our first feedback, 40% of our grade was finalized because there was only one other assignment left. Even after going to office hours, how to succeed in the next assignment was unclear. I'm not sure if this is how graduate level courses are intended to be, but since this course included first–years, the assignments did not feel appropriate for learning. Because there were few to none concrete guidelines given for assignments, grades were not assigned based on concrete mistakes or meeting the guidelines given. Even after soliciting more feedback in office hours, the course staff gave no concrete ways to improve in future work. I would encourage students to take other classes in race and gender studies, because they can be incredibly powerful and useful. If this course improves, I would encourage students to take it.",0.9843,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

Independent of programming level, I feel like you learn SO MANY SKILLS that are simply so useful regardless of whether you want to do SWE or not. If any of your work remotely involves computers/coding/collaboration, it's so helpful to take this to learn git, learn how to systematize your files, it's been so helpful for research. Also the content is genuinely super interesting and I felt like the labs kind of forced you to engage with every part of the syllabus, so you genuinely become a much better coder.The bad things: this class is the biggest mess I've ever seen at Harvard. I didn't even know courses got to this level of disorganization, and I feel like that becomes even more painful in a class where your work *actually* counts a lot for your grade. Little to no feedback on HWs, it took like 2 months to have some type of schedule defined, project was completely chaotic and we got no feedback up to the final milestone. Very different to 109a/b for example, where it's much more structured. I think the staff is aware and I can imagine they make this better in future years, and I really hope they do, because the class is great and Ignacio is an amazing professor!",0.9863,"Materials but only materials are good. Other than materials, everything is messed up:1.A lot of important materials covered in previous years are not covered this year;2.So much confusion about deadlines, grading, submission, etc. It's very messy. There was once a student requested to fix the autograder, and then what the Professor/Head TA did was remove the autograder instead of fixing it. I was completely shocked by how they do things in this class.3.Everything the instructor added to the class is completely unreasonable. I spent 90% time trying to understand astronomy and only 10% time understanding the 107 concepts.4.The head TA doesn't respect anonymous posting on ED. If I post something there, they will reply to my post with my name in this. 5.Going to class is meaningless. The lecture is very boring.6.Please choose a good professor if you decide to take this class.

Please take it if you have ANY interest in machine learning, software deployment methods, or any of those tools you see on industry job descriptions (like Docker and Kubernetes). I will describe some specifics of why this course was so good:– The project specification was extremely clear. For a course with a semester–long project, this is critical. Pavlos, Shivas, and the team put a lot of effort into designing a reasonable project roadmap and thinking through all the steps and deliverables. We were never at a loss for what we needed to be working on for any given assignment. Also, the project deliverables were evenly spaced throughout the semester, and the project was designed such that students can use it for their professional portfolio.– The in–class lectures and demos showed a TON of hard work and preparation on the part of the teaching staff. I found the demos (and associated Github repos) to be incredibly valuable teaching tools. Pavlos always made sure the demo would work before class, sometimes testing it multiple times. – The content of the course is SUPER relevant to essentially any career or project in machine learning, and many other areas outside machine learning. I have looked for a course for years that would teach me Docker, Kubernetes, cloud platforms, Weights and Biases, etc. Many courses assume you know this material, and MANY companies require skills in these areas, but no other course actually teaches it. Pavlos saw that gap and created the perfect course to fill it. – The strategy of assigning each group to one TF was very effective, because it allowed each group to work with their TF to explain the unique features of their project, and not suffer from inconsistencies in grading between TFs.In summary, don't hesitate to take this course! Find a good group and establish good communication. I recommend a smaller group otherwise it can be hard to coordinate with everyone. Choose a relatively simple project with a less complicated model–– you will still have a very impressive project by the end of the semester.",0.9916,"This is a great course, but it is very disorganized. It is unclear where to find the code from class, as it is in GitHub repos that have to be accessed from the slides.

Anna is so fantastic as an instructor and she's a total expert (and in some cases THE expert) on the course material, which functions as an overview of her research. The class seems like 40/60 undergrads/grad students and most sessions are whiteboard lectures, though there's the occasional group presentation day. The class only has 4 psets and a final project and tbh the workload is somewhat low (~5 hours a week but that's inflated from the project) but it's definitely what you put in scaling with what you get out, seems pretty appropriate for a grad theory class. Basically if the syllabus is interesting to you I would jump up and down to recommend the class.

But definitely don't expect to come out of the class with a rigorous understanding of any one of them –– this is very much a survey–type class. The first 1/3 of the class (information theory) is definitely the best organized and taught part of the  course. The second 1/3 is statistics (a subset of stat 111 covering MLE and Bayesian stat). Idk, maybe it was just me, but after taking a real stat course, their way of doing things looked pretty sloppy and confusing. The last 1/3 is ML, which was interesting and although it had a fair amount of overlap with cs 181, I still learned a lot of new things and gained some intuition.I did take this class after stat 111 and cs 181, which I wouldn't necessarily recommend since it was a bit repetitive. However, Sharad is an excellent lecturerer and the way he motivated everything using information theory and the perspective of a physicist/biologist was still quite new and interesting to me. I think it says something about the class that I still learned from it even coming in with a decent background.The problem sets for this class were decent, but you kind of had no idea what you were going to get. Sometimes they were super easy, sometimes super hard/fancy coding, and sometimes incredibly tedious algebra. MULTIPLE TIMES they would have these problems that were worded in an incredibly confusing way that nobody could figure out (eg has a paragraph of incomprehensible text and then asks about some variables that aren't even defined in the text). Then, when you went to ask the professor or the TFs they seemed to have no idea what the problem was trying to ask either or would give conflicting / self –contradictory explanations of the question. Like ??? The course staff is super chill, so it's ok. It was just a bit weird LOL.",0.9933,"This was one of my favorite, perhaps the favorite class, I've taken at Harvard. Despite being familiar with some of the material, I was excited to go to lecture and see how Sharad thought about it. We spent ~2 weeks in CS 181 on the expectation maximization algorithm, and Sharad presented it more clearly in 45 minutes. He is an incredibly engaging lecturer and it really feels like he has a deep, intuitive understanding of what he is talking about. The course moves quickly over topics sometimes, but I it is intended to be a survey course, and I think it is an excellent survey course. The one downside I'd say is that it was a bit unclear how to complete some of the problem set questions sometimes, but that was more of minor irritant than a major problem with the course.",-0.5367,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

I feel like this course fundamentally changed how I view myself. I used to think that I'm not really an artsy/creative person. I took photos for fun or for memories, but I didn't really share them nor did I see myself as someone with creative outlets or artistic vision. Certainly the technical aspects of learning photography helped me feel differently, but ultimately, I feel like this course was also a class on life, how to live life, how art is an expression of life, and how we all can make art ourselves. I think about photography so differently now –– photos as revealing something intimate about the photographer, their relation to the environment and the photographed, spelled out in the framing/composition/technical details of the photo itself. This class has fundamentally changed how I see the world with beauty, wonder, and complexity –– the patterns and geometries and intimacies that are already present, which this class has helped train me to look at and appreciate and photograph. This is without a doubt my favorite and most impactful class I have taken at Harvard. Patrice has such a unique pedagogy, and the class truly embodies their vision of what education at Harvard could be: classes that help us grow, feel, live, explore, think as fellow human beings. I have never felt so connected with my classmates (truly we were in it together during our critiques), and much of that is a product of how Patrice fosters a dynamic and CARING class environment: the music that we listened to together in class before critiques, the compliment notes that we passed to each other for feedback, the class photobook, the guest speakers/critics, the films and movies we watched, the tea and snacks on the shelf... they are all testaments to how this course was set up for us to succeed and grow as artists and as people. I'm coming out of this course with a way of looking, loving, and photographing the world around me, not to mention many beautiful prints for friends and family (along with invaluable room decor)!",0.9967,,0.0,,0.0,220429,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,"Art, Film, and Visual Studies","Art, Film, and Visual Studies",,Arts and Humanities,,Studio,Introduction to Still Photography

I learned relatively little about the craft of photography, as someone who came in with everything to learn, with little prior experience.I would say I come away with this course confident in: 1) managing aperture, shutter speed, and ISO 2) how to use flash and white balance 3) file and hard drive management and conversion4) printing prints of diverse sizes the proper way While those are great and substantive skills, they are vastly less than what should have been learned in a semester of this class, which had nearly 6 hours of class time a week, on top of a 2 hour lab. We never learned composition –– as just one example, the ""rule of thirds"" was something I heard about only through a friend in a different intro to photography class. Color theory and editing were nominally explained, but the instruction was primarily a demonstration that, if you wanted to, you could choose to adjust, say, exposure or highlights. I never understood how to look at a photograph with a discerning eye and make those edits productively; to the very end of this class, I was merely pushing a slider on the screen to see what number made the photograph look nicest, frustrated that we had never meaningfully learned to technically analyze and edit a photograph. In class, there was minimal instruction, and time was spent meandering between watching miscellaneous videos the Prof liked, taking extended breaks, or spending extensive time discussing general life lessons. Patrice Helmar is a professor of genuine wisdom who shared many thoughtful and moving things, but the difficult fact that those things were essentially all I got in regard to learning anything about photography from them –– besides periodic instruction in the lab from our TF –– made it hard to appreciate them as a teacher. The primary advice given by them when asked questions like how to improve the visual appeal of a given photograph, or decide whether to print it in color or black and white, were responses like ""sing the song that only you know,"" and ""show us your world."" They were positive and empowering sentiments for a teacher to say, but those ideas can’t work when they're replacing real, concrete instruction that we needed to get better.I left this class feeling defeated and a bit embarrassed that I had so little to show for so much time spent in class, time that could have been spent doing a million other things. ALL THIS SAID: this course seemed to work wonderfully for people who were already trained in photography; it gave them an opportunity to practice, experiment, and get a bit of feedback on their work, and engage with people who were true experts in the field. Those kids in my class very demonstrably improved by the end and I imagine will have positive things to say about this course. If you do not know photography, do not take this course to learn it.",0.9956,,0.0,,0.0,220429,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,"Art, Film, and Visual Studies","Art, Film, and Visual Studies",,Arts and Humanities,,Studio,Introduction to Still Photography

The math is not terribly difficult (no calculus required, physics knowledge is helpful), but I would recommend taking notes and jotting down the formulas presented in lecture. You will be seeing them again. Above all else, enjoy your time with Professor Charbonneau. He is a radiant and infinitely–insightful professor, and he is genuinely fascinated by the material. Ask him any and all questions you may have, and listen as he guides you to a new understanding of a topic you hadn't previously considered.

Furthermore, Professor Eisenstein is just incredibly knowledgeable and very supportive and invested in answering questions and making himself available to students. He has led or been involved with several impressive astrophysics missions / instruments /surveys, ranging from SDSS to DESI to the James Webb Space Telescope; Prof. Eisenstein is very interested in instrumentation, and so you learn about the instruments themselves, too. I appreciated the effort this class makes in giving you the chance to actually work with real survey and spectroscopic data, and think about the instruments that gathered them, not just absorb (cool) astrophysics theories and knowledge.

Lacking in the ""physics"" of astrophysics and often just describes the phenomena without really discussing the implications and what everything really means. Unless you put in the extra effort, you just have to take everything as given. If this sounds less appealing to you, would just recommend taking as much physics as possible until you can take Astron 130 or Physics 212. If you're an astrophysics concentrator, you have to take this course but as a concentrator myself lowkey regret taking the 16/17 intro sequence and would have preferred to have concentrated in physics and just take higher level astro classes further down the line.

Problem sets force you to understand the course material really well. They are really hard, but this is fair for a course covering this sort of materialCons / stuff that this course needs to improve:1. WAY more office hours. There was just one set of office hours per week, which I could never make because I had a class at that time. It would be really nice to have multiple sets of office hours, especially because the problem sets are so difficult. (Section is not really the same as OH, because section is more like a recap of lecture)2. Slower paced lectures , or more pauses in lectures so we can ask questions – sometimes I would get confused on a concept 15 or 20 minutes into lecture, and if Prof Narayan just progresses straight to the next concept, I don't really get a chance to ask questions.  Since later lecture material builds on earlier lecture material, I would remain confused for the later parts of the lecture.3. Practice problems for the final exam. Since we didn't have practice problems, I went into the final exam not really knowing what to expect. I am particularly frustrated that there were no practice problems because Ay 200's was the only final exam I've ever taken where practice problems were not given to students.4. Problem sets are extremely inconsistent in their difficulty. For instance, Problem Set 6 was very hard and took me a very long time to finish, while Problem Set 7 was extremely easy (to the point where it didn't really help me understand the material better) and took me only around 30 minutes to finish.

Though it was a hugeee trauma–bonding class, I think we can all confidently say we all became easily became friends because we were spending so much time with each other. Establishing a solid Pset group from the very beginning is essential... or do what we did and make a class group chat :p!For a bioengineer, a solid understanding of systems and signals is essential. And as you start to learn more through this class you will understand what I mean. This class made me more confident as a bioengineer concentrator because for once, I feel as though I was able to hone and master something special to my field of study that I can contribute in a group setting. Moreover, it made me feel very confident in my Matlabs skills which is a great thing to feel confident in looking forward to thesising and applying it in other classes in scenarios that require rigorous calculations. Though Maurice can be all over the place at times, he is really funny which makes the class more palatable. On the other hand, I think the material is pretty streamlined and very well organized. This has to be the most challenging but fulfilling class I have taken so far at this school.

However, if the time ever comes that BE110 can be replaced with another course (like ES157), avoid this class at all costs. Maurice is actually fine as a person, contrary to many previous reports. However, the issue is that he's totally disorganized. Expectations are totally unclear (for pset answers, exam answers, conceptual understanding, etc), and you never know where you stand grade–wise. Also, test conditions are awful. For our first midterm, Maurice showed up 20 minutes late and projected a PDF of the exam onto the projector and handed us blank printer paper to write our answers on. He also left the room for 20 minutes at a time, during which the projector would turn off, leaving us with no exam questions. He wrote question #7 on the chalkboard spontaneously—we had about 10 minutes left in the exam when he decided to do that.",-0.855,,0.0,150189,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Biomedical Engineering,Biomedical Engineering,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Physiological Systems Analysis

Prof Liu splits ""neuroengineering"" into a few categories: observing the brain, probing the brain, and integrated approaches combining these technologies. You can expect to spend about 1/3 of the semester on each one of these. Prof Liu is a very effective lecture –– it feels like he's put a lot of thought into what he is going to present and teaches in a very clear and understandable manner. He is always happy to stop for questions anytime. The lab is super interesting. This year it was tissue clearing of mouse brain sections and then laser confocal microscopy to perform 3D connectivity mapping (basically 3D imaging and reconstruction of the neural structure of the mouse brain). Very cool experience, which was a highlight of the course.Assignments were short prelab/postlab reports, and then 'journal club' midterm presentations where you will present with a group on one of about seven papers provided by Prof Liu. He emphasized time and time again that if you wanted to get anything out of the course, it is vital to read the papers. It is through this exercise that you come to truly understand where the field is now. It is quite easy to just read your own paper and present on it, but I would stand with the professor on this account –– make the extra effort to read as many papers as you can. Your grade does not depend on this, but your understanding will definitely deepen. I found the presentations to be good assignments, however because everyone must present on their papers, it did end up taking up a significant portion of class time, which was a little unfortunate. Also, *do not go over the time limit in your presentations*. Prof Liu is very strict about them and likes to keep class on time. Final projects were fun, I liked the idea of having us write NIH–style grant proposals for novel research. Talk to Prof Liu about your project ideas –– he is a wonderful resource and was very helpful and thoughtful. Prof Liu really is a leader in this field, and knows his stuff quite well.

Jeff is also very nice and fair as an instructor.  He was clear with us that he wanted to make sure the content did challenge us, but wasn't too hard.

This course probably requires a fair bit of motivation to keep at it — which isn't a bad thing if you have it!  If you feel like the above describes you, and you can keep that in view while going through the class, I think you'll see why the material is important and how you will benefit from it.I would say students should come into this class already motivated to learn the material, rather than looking to get motivation out of the class. My view is that this course is all about simultaneously showing students the statistical software practices necessary to do rigorous statistics alongside its theoretical justification. That said, it leans pretty heavily towards the theory (that's most of what you see in class). So I wouldn't say you learn a ton of R programming from the class — just how to do what you need to, which is mostly fitting models, performing hypothesis tests, and not all the data cleaning/management that surrounds that.  It would be helpful to make sure you've brushed up on your R programming before going into this class.  I would say this course expects that you should at least be able to write functions in R without stressing about it. It's a good class!  It's just more advanced than most people who are just interested in ""statistics"" or ""data science"" typically need.

David is SERIOUSLY talented as a scientist, mentor, and lecturer –– I have no idea how he hasn't won a Nobel prize yet. He's extremely knowledgable about all things gene editing, but also an entertaining lecturer. The class dives into a *lot* of different aspects of gene editing –– mechanisms, pharmaceutical development, policy, ethics, etc. I honestly didn't think it would be able to cover everything, but we went in depth on basically everything they mentioned in the syllabus! It's totally focused on the science elements though, so I'd recommend a different class (SCRB 120?) if you're interested in the ethical debates of gene editing. It's tough to make a 3 hour class on Friday  evening entertaining, but David does a pretty good job. If you're not used to long classes, though, the lecture can be really brutal. As engaging as David is as a lecturer, the class isn't very interactive (it's 2 hours of content–based lecture, and 45 minutes of student presentations on individual papers related to that week's topic). The final projects were really fun, and we had a lot of creative liberty. The TFs are also a shining part of this course experience. Nick and Colin are AMAZING. Absolutely phenomenal!!! They can break down the most complex papers into picture books!

I had little experience going in – 9th grade biology and COVID 10th grade chemistry – but I did just fine (at least I think, I haven't seen my final grade yet). My first piece of advice is to get sleep. Basic, I know, but if you are not following the lectures and getting behind on understanding the topics, a large part of the reason may be because you were not well rested enough before lecture to comprehend the material. I say this because after going back and thoroughly studying the lectures before exams, they actually made sense with all of my focus and energy on them. Tucci is an excellent lecturer, very engaging, and encourages asking questions. Enjoy the time you have with him during the chemistry component, when it switches to biology only then will you understand how superb he truly was. PROTIP: not necessary for this course since it includes a course calendar, but please put all of your class times, office hours, exam dates, assignment due dates, etc. on your google calendar before classes start (during orientation). It will save you lots of stress because you will not have time to do this during the year.Schedule:Lectures 3 times a week (hard to wake up but recorded – I have never missed a lecture though). Lab once a week for two and a half hours – you need safety goggles ($12 on amazon, $20 at the Coop). In the lab you can only have a pencil out. Sit at the front where the Lab TF is if you want to actually know what’s going on.Section – TF very much determines how useful these are for you. Mine was a gem.Structure:A course google calendar is provided and is extremely helpful because it includes all assignment due dates, class times, and office hours. The Canvas is very organized and everything you need is in one place. I have never once spent more than five seconds looking for a material (except for maybe the beginning when getting used to everything).Lecture handouts are provided for each lecturer, but make sure to write down additional explanations, more than what they write on the notes.The Canvas also recommends reading the textbook chapters and pre–readings, but these are also not necessary as I have never read one. Even Tucci said the textbook chapters are not needed.Assignments:1 P–Set a week. Chemistry p–sets were easier to follow but checking with friends and in help room is a must during the biology portion; grading is often very picky. I spent 3–6 hours on these.Pre lab due before lab section. Often hard to understand and complete when just seeing the lab on paper, especially since they expect you to be able to devise your own instructions to follow and already know how to complete the calculations for what you are testing. Can be done in 1–2 hours in help room.Lab Report due after the lab that is usually more writing and calculations. Can also be done in 1–2 hours in help room.Optional practice problems. Not necessary to complete. I have never done a practice problem.Midterms:Looking back, the first exam (chemistry) is EXTREMELY easy. Please study. Do the practice exams. This is non–negotiable. I scored pretty low (for over–achiever standards) because I did not study enough, and without the first exam score I would have easily gotten an A in this course. The second exam (chemistry) went the best for me, and the last exam was shaky because it was biology and poorly taught, but oh well. Final Exam:Start in advance. Just do it. Even if you look at your notes for an hour a day starting reading period, or do one problem a day, I promise it makes all the difference. For reference this final was on the last day of the examination period (Wednesday) and I started the weekend before (Saturday) but did not take it seriously until Monday which resulted in me not being able to take both practice tests and losing out on sleep as I packed my suitcase and studied the night before. Another tip, I know you want to leave, but if you are not proactive and tend to procrastinate, I do not recommend flying out right after the exam because the extra stress is not worth it (though it is a sweet, sweet victory).Conclusion:Overall, it is a great course that does what it’s supposed to; I definitely have a strong foundation in chemistry and biology. You can definitely get an A if you work like you are supposed to and since this class is only offered in the fall semester, if you are even considering it just take it. For reference I am a potential physics concentrator but postponed physics in favor of this course. I hope I didn’t forget anything, and if you read all this, I hope it helped!

As someone who was debating between LPSA and LS1A (especially because I had taken AP Biology but not AP Chem in high school), I am so glad that I stuck with LPSA. There is so much more support in LPSA, and you don't have annoying weekly PIEs like LS1A does. There is a decent amount of work in LPSA and you are in class more, but I feel like it is equivalent to the amount of work you have to do in LS1A (because of their learning pods). Especially as someone who had a roommate in LS1A who did not enjoy the class, I'm super grateful for LPSA and the immense support that they give. My best piece of advice would be to ask for help EARLY! I felt low–key embarrassed to ask for help at first, until I realized that I really needed it and requested a peer tutor through the ARC. Best decision ever. My tutor, Akua, was amazing and really helped quell my worries and review major topics coming up in exams.  Topics in LPSA are not so difficult where you need a tutor, but it was super helpful to make sure that I was reviewing content regularly outside of class, since that is really important for success in this class. Be sure you understand the material and are paying attention in class. Even though it's early at 9 AM, it really does make a difference in your coursework + saves time overall! Professor Tucci is great with large lectures, so it won't be too hard :)Section was super helpful for reinforcing content and applying it to practice problems. My TF, Ada, was amazing! She did a great job going over topics and would explain them in an easy–to–understand way while going through questions. I'm very grateful for LPSA. Even though it is considered to be the ""easier"" course as compared to LS1A, I learned a lot and was far less stressed than the LS1A students. Especially as a freshman who was still adjusting to college life, LS1A was the best decision to transition from high school to college learning.",0.9989,Study!!!

He gives a very comprehensive history of Greece and its very intentional about going against the grain when it comes to accounting for things like foreign influences, which was refreshing. He also makes it all the way through lecture the vast majority of the time, so you never feel like you're missing out. He is very willing to pause lecture and provide further explanations for things or go down rabbit holes if you have a question. Very good with audience participation and is good at soliciting many different voices every lecture. Eli is a very good TF. His feedback on assignments always makes sense and he is very willing to meet with you during office hours to explain anything you don't understand. I once had to miss a lecture and Eli gave me my own personalized lecture during office hours, which made me feel like I missed basically nothing. He also offered to lend me his copy of our textbook more than once. He seems genuinely interested in making sure everyone succeeds in the class. He's great at leading section. My one criticism would be that he is longwinded, so if you're in office hours with somewhere to be, try not to ask too many questions.WORKLOAD (5/10): Readings are assigned per lecture instead of per week, which really annoyed me. My whole Sunday and Tuesday were taken up just doing the readings for this class. Most of the readings aren't mentioned in lecture or section, and frankly can be skimmed or skipped if you have other work to do. When readings are mentioned in lecture, Dr. Kosmin summarizes whatever is most important about them anyway (either their thesis or how they changed classical scholarship). The textbook we had this semester is very comprehensive, but everything discussed in the textbook will be reiterated in a more comprehensive, synthesized, engaging, and sensical manner in lecture. We are also only ever quizzed/tested on information from lectures, not the readings, which make them feel especially extraneous. There are weekly quizzes on information from lecture, but every lecture is accompanied by a silly little handout from Eli that literally tells you every thing you need to learn from that lecture that you'll be quizzed on, so you just need to pay enough attention in lecture to note what's important about each item. Literally the most painless weekly quizzes I've ever had. We also have weekly discussion posts that are graded on completion, and Eli makes really fun prompts that always get you thinking harder about the history or scholarship. MIDTERM & FINAL (9/10): Since there are weekly quizzes, you know exactly what to expect on the midterm and final. There's also a final project/paper, and the project option is really cool.

You will likely learn more about any single battle by reading its Wikipedia page than you will by taking this class. Additionally, lectures were often disorganized, forcing the TFs to do remedial work in section explaining what we were supposed to have learned that week. Despite the fact that this course had an extremely low workload, I would still not recommend it to friends –– I would rather have simply done the work for a more meaningful class. The professor also attempted to change the final project from a Powerpoint presentation to a substantial paper after the add–drop period had closed. Assignments were frequently posted to Canvas without any announcement and were given short deadlines. I should note in the interest of fairness that the course exposes you to a number of ancient Greek artifacts from the Harvard Art Museum's collection, which was a cool experience.",-0.6668,This is a huge gem,0.3182,,,,,,,,,

It is an amazing course. Prof. Coleman is an amazing teacher who really cared about her students and is really good at making you learn all the material. But it is also a very time consuming class and probably the most difficult Classics Department course I have taken so far (ps. I have not taken 112s). Epigraphy is very nitty–gritty, and there are a lot of memorization in this class: abbreviations, epigraphic conventions, dates, historic context, so many things. And Prof. Coleman is not particularly a nice grader. Your quiz grade can easily go from A in the previous one to C or D in the next one, because so much of it depends on whether you are attentive enough to figure out everything on the stone. We have a lot of reading in English that are pretty overwhelming to get through but are never discussed in class. Not a lot of Latin reading for homework, but what we read in class is HARD. Most inscriptions or graffiti we translate are legalese (with tons of clauses), or have archaic spelling, or misspelling, or just poor grammar that hardly makes sense. You really have to think outside of the box and know your original forms and charts. There could be a million way to translate habere and facere in a legalese context. And you also have to learn so much weird vocab, anything ranges from ""tunnel"" to a kind of gladiator. The final project is pretty cool, but since so much scholarship on epigraphy in general is written in Italian or German or French, it was a pain to google translate every single article that is mildly relevant or to channel all the Latin you know to try to read Italian... I enjoyed writing my final paper and felt really accomplished afterward. But I do not miss the process of researching. I do not regret taking this class at all. It is really cool and refreshing to learn and read the regular Roman Latin, to laugh at their jokes, to emphasize with parents who lost their child. It also made my Latin grammar improve a lot, since I have to think in reverse on what ending should this abbreviated word has. Again, Prof. Coleman is a great and concise teacher on the basics. And I would definitely love to take more epigraphy classes in the future if there are any chances. But it was a challenging and time consuming class, and you should consider it at your own discretion.",0.994,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

The syllabus was what initially drew me into signing up for this class, and after reading all the books I still stand by that fact, as I read intriguing novels that were often not what I was used to reading. Professor Damrosch really dissected each novel for us and I'm still amazed that he could pack that much analysis in a 2–hour class and completely redefine what I initially thought of each book, in some cases! He's an incredibly enthusiastic, engaging, and entertaining professor, who is also very supportive of his students and readily makes himself available to meet for office hours. Workload–wise, this class was light other than reading novels each week and a final paper at the end, which I loved because this allowed me to really focus on being able to dive into each novel without worrying about juggling other assignments simultaneously for the class, and I honestly think I learned and retained much more that way instead of having multiple assignments to do during the semester! Professor Damrosch also allowed us to get feedback on a draft of our final paper, which I feel like is rare for professors to do, which shows how much he is willing to help his students and really eased a lot of the stress in writing a final paper. He was also super receptive of student feedback on the readings for this course and is making some changes to the syllabus based on it, so I'm sure next semester will be even better in terms of the content!

It introduces you to a new way of thinking, and the material you go over is actually very interesting. The only thing I will say is that some of the lectures can be a little boring as it can get into pretty dense math, but you really don't truly need to understand the complex math and its proofs. As long as you understand the major conceptual takeaways you will be fine. Definitely not much work outside of class as there were only 3 psets all year (1 per month), each  of which was based on completion. Each one took 3 hours max, and that was because I cared about actually getting the answers right, and being pretty thorough. Additionally, every student has to take notes for one lecture and then write a page about your takeaways, and my only qualm is that this was pretty harshly graded given that they give us almost no info on what they expected. Thus, I would really make sure you write these in depth. Finally, most of your grade (75%) will depend on the final project which is also not much work as they do a good job of spreading out the milestones. It is a group project which is nice too, so doing it with your friends is really chill and you get full ownership over choosing your topic. If you choose a fun topic, it will actually be enjoyable. I have yet to receive my grade back for this final project, but seeing everyone present their project was really cool and low stress as the presentation wasn't graded.

I can go on forever just raving about this class, and I truly mean that I stand by all the positive reviews of this course. CS 61 never failed to make my day; I always looked forward to attending lectures on Mondays and Wednesdays, and on the days that we didn't have lectures or sections, namely on Fridays, I would feel a little sad. Any day with CS 61 is a good day. And Professor Mickens is one of, if not the top, reason that makes this class so worth taking. He is an absolutely BRILLIANT professor and an even more inspiring systems expert. Coming in with some experience with systems and embedded security,  I found myself growing increasingly fascinated by the topics and concepts discussed in class. Although comprehending the materials wasn't always an initial 100% direct osmosis transfer of ideas and genius as Mickens intended, this course really gives you the time and opportunity to marinate and ask questions to fully grasp the granular details throughout the week. Mickens is a phenomenal lecturer in the way that he understands the subject so well that each lecture almost transforms into storytelling –– he is engaging, coherent (like a buffer cache), and thoughtful and detailed when responding to students' questions. Not to mention the terrific slides that are constantly interspersed with hilarious memes and jokes that never fail to crack the class up. Time truly flies in this class, because I never notice that an hour and fifteen minutes have passed until Mickens announces the end of a lecture. I left 1.321 every Monday and Wednesday wishing for even a little more time going down rabbit holes and exploring topics beyond the level taught in the course. It is so easy to become completely immersed and engrossed in the granular details when you're in this class. Heck, I even nearly got to meet former president Obama thanks to this class and Professor Mickens! He, along with the rest of the teaching staff, is so available, approachable, and supportive. After every lecture (and I do mean every single one), Professor Mickens would spend 1.5 – 2 hours of extended office hours to answer our questions, explore concepts (unveiling all the ""gore"" that truly goes on behind the scenes of some concepts we abstract away for the sake of the class) beyond the depth at which they're presented in the course, and share some of his seemingly endless number of life stories. This class has given me such an invaluable introduction to CS at Harvard and it has been a wonderfully transformative experience overall. Additionally, the course is easily one of the most well–structured and reasonably paced CS class I have ever taken –– the pset schedule is manageable, and there is a plethora of OHs throughout the week to help clarify concepts you may be confused about at first. The psets are very interesting and the extra credit opportunities are super cool! If you are on the fence about taking it (especially as a freshman), take it!! Start psets early, find your group, engage in the Ed forum, and enjoy the course!!! I have found so many friends and mentors through CS 61, and I would recommend this course in a heartbeat to anyone who is interested in systems programming or would just like to learn more about it.",0.9984,"As hard as Mickens tries, there’s only so much you can do to make systems interesting.

CS 61 never failed to make my day; I always looked forward to attending lectures on Mondays and Wednesdays, and on the days that we didn't have lectures or sections, namely on Fridays, I would feel a little sad. Any day with CS 61 is a good day. And Professor Mickens is one of, if not the top, reason that makes this class so worth taking. He is an absolutely BRILLIANT professor and an even more inspiring systems expert. Coming in with some experience with systems and embedded security,  I found myself growing increasingly fascinated by the topics and concepts discussed in class. Although comprehending the materials wasn't always an initial 100% direct osmosis transfer of ideas and genius as Mickens intended, this course really gives you the time and opportunity to marinate and ask questions to fully grasp the granular details throughout the week. Mickens is a phenomenal lecturer in the way that he understands the subject so well that each lecture almost transforms into storytelling –– he is engaging, coherent (like a buffer cache), and thoughtful and detailed when responding to students' questions. Not to mention the terrific slides that are constantly interspersed with hilarious memes and jokes that never fail to crack the class up. Time truly flies in this class, because I never notice that an hour and fifteen minutes have passed until Mickens announces the end of a lecture. I left 1.321 every Monday and Wednesday wishing for even a little more time going down rabbit holes and exploring topics beyond the level taught in the course. It is so easy to become completely immersed and engrossed in the granular details when you're in this class. Heck, I even nearly got to meet former president Obama thanks to this class and Professor Mickens! He, along with the rest of the teaching staff, is so available, approachable, and supportive. After every lecture (and I do mean every single one), Professor Mickens would spend 1.5 – 2 hours of extended office hours to answer our questions, explore concepts (unveiling all the ""gore"" that truly goes on behind the scenes of some concepts we abstract away for the sake of the class) beyond the depth at which they're presented in the course, and share some of his seemingly endless number of life stories. This class has given me such an invaluable introduction to CS at Harvard and it has been a wonderfully transformative experience overall. Additionally, the course is easily one of the most well–structured and reasonably paced CS class I have ever taken –– the pset schedule is manageable, and there is a plethora of OHs throughout the week to help clarify concepts you may be confused about at first. The psets are very interesting and the extra credit opportunities are super cool! If you are on the fence about taking it (especially as a freshman), take it!! Start psets early, find your group, engage in the Ed forum, and enjoy the course!!! I have found so many friends and mentors through CS 61, and I would recommend this course in a heartbeat to anyone who is interested in systems programming or would just like to learn more about it.",0.9984,"As hard as Mickens tries, there’s only so much you can do to make systems interesting. He’s a top lecturer in Harvard’s CS department but I ended up skipping lecture a lot this semester because systems is just so boring. Psets aren’t as scary as they seem although youre kinda screwed if you don’t do extra credit.",-0.827,,0.0,123623,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Computer Science,Computer Science,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Systems Programming and Machine Organization

Independent of programming level, I feel like you learn SO MANY SKILLS that are simply so useful regardless of whether you want to do SWE or not.

I didn't even know courses got to this level of disorganization, and I feel like that becomes even more painful in a class where your work *actually* counts a lot for your grade. Little to no feedback on HWs, it took like 2 months to have some type of schedule defined, project was completely chaotic and we got no feedback up to the final milestone.

I was completely shocked by how they do things in this class.3.Everything the instructor added to the class is completely unreasonable. I spent 90% time trying to understand astronomy and only 10% time understanding the 107 concepts.4.The head TA doesn't respect anonymous posting on ED. If I post something there, they will reply to my post with my name in this. 5.Going to class is meaningless.

So, although lectures aren't the most exciting, if you're willing and able to take yourself through the course too (and with extra guidance from other resources) then it's worth it!",0.9974,"I had a lot of trouble understanding some of the lectures, and the midterm was a lot more difficult than previous years so a lot of people were underprepared for it.  The problem sets were doable, but I think my general criticism is that I never really had time to fully think about/grasp the concepts of this course because it would already be time to start the next problem set.  Otherwise, it was very doable with STAT110, which is a very common thing to do. It is also a good class to take after taking CS 20 in the previous spring semester.",-0.799,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

I think Stephen Chong (Prof Chong, Steve? What does one use on the QGuide?) is really a solid instructor and both is clearly interested in the course and in you (I didn't do this much, but he just seems super nice to chat to. If you're reading this, thanks :). My friend who took 152 told me before I took the class 'he gives the definition of a CS lecture', and that's exactly how I would put it. There's no Eddie emacs wizardry, there's no Mickens meme pyrotechnics, but nor is there a Hesterberg black board derivation that causes abject misery in 80% of those unfortunate enough to be actually trying to pay attention in 124 lecture (for context, I really like Adam too and actually enjoy his lectures, but I can understand why some don't) etc. Rather, you get the content delivered at a reasonable pace, at generally very clearly. If you were paying attention, it will make sense, and you will walk out feeling like you learned something in basically every lecture.  While sometimes I miss that thrill of the CS (or other) class where you have no idea what the heck is going to go down each day, it is nice knowing that if you pay attention in lecture, you should basically know everything you need to know (no section which rocks, and lecture is clear enough that I don't think anybody will say they want section here). PSET0 is not a real comparison to the main PSETs, I maybe wish they made it slightly harder or introduced a few other things that will be helpful to know in OCaml that appears in the starter code and you then have to google, or if you're like me, ignore until PSET4 and just shrug and say 'it's in the handout, it works somehow' and then discover what '@@'  does and why actually it kinda rocks in the ocaml world. The PSETs are decently hefty, but totally doable and fine if you start at reasonable times (again, 165 meant sometimes I was starting like 1–2 days before deadlines, and having to dip into late days. This can be done, but it was pretty stressful as someone who hates doing work last minute, and one PSET I made a bad design decision that I couldn't really recover from and took the hit knowing that I was gonna fail like half the student tests. Student tests are generally like 5% of a PSET grade though, so it cost like 2%, no biggie).Final is totally fair, PSET late days are pretty generous and office hours were overall good. In summary, just a really solid CS course – you'll learn a good amount, you shouldn't lose too much hair (it's an important metric to me okay) and you'll have a reasonably good time doing it.",0.9972,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

This was brutal, as expected. I feel like I learned a lot, as I expected. I don't think I walked away with a huge amount of insane knowledge about how data systems work. Yes I understand batching, indexing and joins far better than I did coming in (but you could learn about a B–tree and it would make sense from a 20min youtube video, and hash joins is mostly just... use a good hash table). I am also not a perf or gdb god, or suddenly converted to neovim and ascended to a higher level of CS entity within the CS community (maybe that will be after 161 next sem, don't ask why I'm doing this to myself in my senior year, and perhaps use this to caveat all opinions shared here). However, I without a doubt feel that I became a better systems programmer. It's rare here you need to actually think about how to organize a project. My final code, just including .c files that I wrote, is 5500–6000 lines of C. Honestly that doesn't feel like that much now, but after re–writing functions, changing how things fitted together, the amount of code I've deleted, changing or refactored, I reckon I actually wrote 2–3x that this semester. Thinking about how you organize a project of that size was super valuable to me. What functions should be accessible in other files. What should be defined in shared header files, what should be unique to each header file. Maybe you want to use extern. Maybe you want to consider what should be global, what should be specific to a client context.  I actually genuinely considered cache effects – I changed my load function at some point (much later than I should've), and watched my load performance improve by a factor of like 50 (yes, if you're reading this in the class, make your load faster earlier and save yourself pain later. Or don't and get the learning experience). I experimented with the worst nested loop join, then the cache page at a time nested loop join, and crazy, it makes a HUGE difference. Just some examples. I didn't really ever think about the TLB and never really needed to it felt like.Lectures were overall pretty good, I have no idea where an attendance grade came from at the midterm so please be careful about that and ask about attendance points. The first midterm was psycho hard, the second one was in my opinion, extremely doable (I got a 70 on the first one, admittedly I got the takehome deadline wrong, but I still think I would get <90 (/100 but with like 40 bonus points I think), second one I got 130/130). I would recommend watching a few of the sections and going to lab in the first few weeks to get setup, maybe I just can't read but setting up the testing locally etc was a bit of a headache initially.The testing set up this year felt a bit all over the place, the tests literally were being changed up until the last week and had a major change at the end of Novemeber. I hope this is a one time pain point and not a problem for future years, as it was pretty confusing/caused some stress, unsure if tests were failing because I can't code or because the tests were broken, changed or whatever. Labs also didn't run every day as promised on the website, I barely used them (probably a mistake) but I think it's worth saying, I think the course needs one or two extra staff for future iterations.My brain power is running out, I submitted the report like 5 hours ago and am completely spent, but just to end on some practical tips that maybe will be useful if you do decide to take the course:–> Do milestone 0, it takes very little time and you'll thank your previous self a HUGE amount when you're fighting the deadline at the end like most of us. I was able to do naive hash joins in a few hours since I had the hash table from m0 ready to go (please don't bank on this though).–> Write some unit tests. I had one void function like test_batch() in most of my header files, so that I didn't have to add functions to the header file that shouldn't be accessible outside the function (other option is two versions of the header file, and use different include paths, I started going this route initially but it was just a bit of a hassle). This really helped me at times, especially for index creation – writing unit tests to check my sorting stuff was working correctly meant I knew that my cache conscious mergesort worked correctly, so it must be how I was calling it that was wrong, helped me spot a dumb mistake very fast that otherwise I might've been trying to debug my sort algo forever. Just one example.–> Write a better load function than just stream inserts.

I am so disappointed to write this, because I've been wanting to take this class since I was a freshman (I'm a senior). It was unfortunately a truly terrible experience. I've never taken a class this poorly run. I never leave Q reviews like this, but this class was a logistical nightmare. We didn't get any grades back until the last week of the semester, and even then (as of the last day before Q reviews are due) we have not received feedback on any of the major assignments, including the first one which was due in the first week of OCTOBER. This made it impossible for me to learn/grow/improve –– I have no idea how I'm doing in this class. Staff did not answer questions on Ed, even though this was the way that we were told to get in touch with course staff –– important Ed questions would get 20+ likes and go completely ignored. Labs and assignments were confusing and there was barely any help offered, with office hours for the entire 100+ course only offered during a 2–hour window on Thursday and a 3–hour window on Fridays. This meant that if you had class during these times, there was no way to get help, and office hours were mobbed and panicked. Additionally, from Friday afternoon to Thursday night, there was no way to get help. TFs would consistently show up 30+ minutes late to office hours, and sometimes would not show up at all, instead posting on Ed after the fact. Staff was not at all responsive to student concerns and really didn't seem to care. The grading that we did receive was confusing and we were not able to see or understand why we got points off. The labs varied wildly in length, and were often far too long to complete in class, which was incredibly stressful as there was no help offered outside of class. They were often confusing/tedious/stressful. By the end of the class, I had lost hope that I would actually understand the material, and was just doing my best to solve the problems and get by.

TAKE THIS CLASS!! I cannot recommend it highly enough. If you are interested in theory, if you interested in machine learning at all, then this is the class for you. In my honest opinion, this class explores one of the most exciting research fields in math, computer science, and statistics. There is an abundance of empirical phenomena in machine learning/deep learning that are not well–understood, and the nascent theory to try to explain them is flourishing (most of the papers Prof. Chen discusses are less than 10 years old.)   If you are curious about this extremely new area of theory, then this class gives you the right mental framework, the mathematical tools, the background to think about these problems.  In that regard, this class was a formative experience for me and inspired me to go to graduate school.  Prerequisites: In terms of concrete requirements you should know theoretical linear algebra (Axler suffices) and real analysis. The research field does not use sophisticated techniques beyond this, and Prof. Chen introduces the background knowledge when necessary. The main requirement is strong problem solving skills.  Lectures: The lectures are very fast, as Prof. Chen basically goes through a paper or two every lecture. It is not easy to follow the lectures, but I thought they were extremely fun, challenging, and engaging. Prof. Chen also does a great job at emphasizing the important ideas of a paper and appropriately splits time between derivations and big concepts. Moreover, Prof. Chen does an amazing job connecting the ideas in the class together and forming cohesive themes throughout the semester. You get the sense that this course is building to some larger goals.Problem sets: I really enjoyed working on the problem sets.  They were a highlight of my semester, challenging but not unmanageable. I would definitely recommend collaborating with a friend.",0.9897,"You get out of this class what you put in. If you pay attention in lecture, ask questions about the material, and complete all of the supplemental readings, you will gain a ton from this course and learn a lot of state of the art theoretical results about machine learning. However, if you have difficulty pushing yourself to do more than the minimum, you may not get too much out of this course. The problem sets, though mathematically rigorous, do not require you to have too much of a conceptual understanding of the material.

Reading the papers was really good; they were good papers in ML systems and I wouldn't have read them in my free time. I think working on the research project is challenging and very time–consuming so definitely start early, and even then it's tons of work. It's definitely, definitely, definitely (and I repeat: DEFINITELY) necessary to continuously communicate with the Prof. and TFs about the project direction so there are no surprises on the day of submission for unexpected feedback. Please find group members that you work well with so again, there are no surprises.",0.9885,"Do NOT take this course under ANY circumstances.The project for this course was extremely difficult, and the expectations were incredibly vague. For this reason, I would strongly advise anyone against taking this course. I will also discuss some other glaring issues with the logistics and course organization. The project assignment for this course is very open–ended. There is no coding content to the course, so you can theoretically be at any level for the project. That’s how the course is advertised. But in reality, you cannot succeed unless you have in–depth systems and networks coding ability at PhD level or above. Even then, you might not meet Prof. Yu’s extremely high expectations.Prof. Yu constantly encouraged my group to work on ideas of enormous scope. Every time we met with her, she stated that we weren’t doing enough and that our project lacked novelty. It is patently ridiculous to expect students to make a large, novel contribution to the entire field of networks and systems, within the span of about 2 months, in a course which has no coding guidance and has several other assignments in addition to the project. Every time we asked Prof. Yu exactly how to actually implement her suggestions, she was very vague and said “just write the code” or similar. It seems like she doesn’t really understand that coding and complex systems implementation are not inherent skills that every person is born with. We are actually here at Harvard to learn these skills, not to be told to “just do it.”I am not exaggerating when I say that Prof. Yu’s project suggestions were 10 times larger than a reasonable scope for a course project. Some of her suggestions would not have been out of place for a PhD dissertation. My group left every single meeting with her feeling deeply stressed and inadequate. We worked constantly on our project throughout the semester and had multiple sleepless nights. Yet without exception, we were met with lukewarm or negative feedback from Prof. Yu at every possible juncture. Prof. Yu would grill us on obscure details related to our project so that we felt clueless and ashamed of our work, even after weeks of effort for every project milestone. The teaching fellows made the course experience even worse. In theory, the teaching fellows were supposed to be available to help students with their projects. However, most students I talked to in the class said that any meetings they scheduled with the teaching fellows were vastly unhelpful. The TFs don’t really know what you’re supposed to do for the project, because Prof. Yu is the only one who grades the projects, so meeting with the TFs for help is pretty unproductive.Additionally, the course had a weird system where you are supposed to send your slides for your in–class paper presentation to one of the TFs. What is the point of this system?  This TF didn’t actually attend class to watch the presentations, so what exactly is he doing with our slides? Is he grading them purely based on textual content? My group ended up having 3x as much text on our slides as we needed, because we had to assume that the TF is somehow grading the presentation without watching it. What about uploading the slides to Canvas? No, this was never discussed. Both Prof. Yu and the TFs refused to use Canvas. The aversion to Canvas extended to grades, which were posted late (a few assignments) or not at all (most assignments). As a result, no one has any idea how they are doing in the course basically at any time. This has remained true throughout the semester. I will also touch on the very frustrating structure of in–class presentations. In theory, students have one class period (75 min) to make their presentation. However, on the first day of student presentations, Prof. Yu insisted on giving a weird half–class lecture which completely disrupted the presentation schedule for the rest of the semester. Every single group except the last few ended up having their presentation cut off in the middle and having to present the second half of it in the next class. This was literally only because of Prof. Yu’s lecture on the first day, which messed up the timing for everyone. Presentations were not only much harder to follow in this format, but stressful for the presenters. Also, students were encouraged to participate in class, but many times when someone would participate, Prof. Yu would follow up and interrogate them on their point, often asking really hard questions. This made it really difficult to participate because I felt like I had to know the topic inside out before speaking up.This course completely ruined my semester, full stop. I am appalled at the incredibly unrealistic expectations Prof. Yu has for students and the very poor logistical organization of the course itself. I would advise that this course should be discontinued because Prof. Yu is not capable of guiding students through their project in a constructive manner, or running a course in line with Harvard’s organizational standards. For future prospective students, please take my advice and stay FAR AWAY from this course.",-0.9945,,0.0,212686,Primarily for Graduate Students,Computer Science,Computer Science,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Advanced Computer Networks

For example, when learning some adjectives, good adjectives will be associated with western parenting and bad adjectives associated with asian or chinese parenting, which is quite ridiculous and which uses lots of stereotypes. I personally do not care what a textbook writer thinks of my parents or their parenting (or my future parenting for that matter) but I think some people might find it quite offensive and I think it is just inappropriate in general to treat Chinese culture or Chinese parents in such an unfair and biased way. The textbook also gives the vibe of trying to criticize Chinese culture or the Chinese government whenever there is a chance, which I guess is not surprising because it's America but even as someone who is not the biggest fan of the Chinese government and fully aware of its problems, I still think it is a bit excessive and unnecessary since it is a Chinese class after all, and I find it hard to imagine an English class textbook with criticisms of British/American culture or the American government whenever possible.",0.9796,,0.0,,0.0,207494,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,East Asian Langs & Civ,Chinese,,Arts and Humanities,,Lecture,Advanced Modern Chinese for High-Proficiency Learners

This makes it very different to any other classes you are likely to take at Harvard. This is a graduate class, which means it is training you to be an effective academic, hence the practicality.

If this class is ever offered again, do not hesitate to take it. Even if you are a STEM concentrator or have never been interested in literature, you'll have a good time in this class. It's a fairly easy class with interesting readings, fun class discussions, and a nice atmosphere. The readings can occasionally be dense, but they aren't long. The readings were always interesting since we got to learn more about Japan's history through poems and fictional stories. I loved how the class covered a wide range of genres to dissect traditional Japanese literature (e.g. plays, short stories, poems, novels, etc.). There were simple weekly Slack assignments, three papers, and one final exam. The papers were fun to complete since you get to dive further into the texts from class, and the assignments are really easy and fun to complete. The professor, David Atherton, was so funny and enthusiastic during lectures. Even if you're having a rough day, he will make you laugh and know to check in on you. If this class isn't offered, you should at least do a class with him. He is so much fun; he provides snacks during class sometimes; he's always cracking jokes; and he makes everyone in class become friends. The lectures in his class are always engaging since he let's us talk to our peers about the readings. He'll encourage people to speak, but he never cold calls or forces participation. It's a chill, fun atmosphere. I had Kassandra Diaz as my TF, and she was the best!! She always gave me inspiration for my papers. She was great facilitating discussions during sections, and she made me see the stories/poems in a different way since she has a deep knowledge  of Japanese history. She's also a fun person since she sometimes held a picnic–style section with class outside while providing snacks!",0.9984,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

Of course you have to study and it's not a gem, but you can definitely get an A if you work hard, go to office hours and get help as needed.

I feel like what I learned has made me a more informed citizen. I found the content really interesting and relevant to my life and the class really helped me understand how our world works. Dr. Maggi also gives an optional personal finance lecture before Thanksgiving break, which I really enjoyed because he literally tells you exactly how to make money through investment, which is the most relevant thing you could possibly learn!I specifically recommend taking Ec10b off cycle because Dr. Maggi is really the highlight of the class, and the smaller class size will give you an opportunity to get to know him. He's the kindest instructor I've ever had. He really cares about his students and literally memorizes everyone's Canvas picture or something, because he knows everybody's name. His lectures are very clear and straightforward, and even though I normally take notes on an iPad, I am a big fan of his no–electronics rule. If you need help in the class or feel yourself falling behind, literally go talk to him. I was never great at social science/humanities subjects so I did struggle a little bit with exams but I felt that they were fair.

Professor Ken Felter is the star and crown jewel of the tutorial program, by my definition, for a number of reasons. First of all, he's a retired partner at a law firm, so he has a bunch of industry experience. He is extremely dedicated to the course and helping his students. He is extremely accessible for office hours and answering a bunch of questions. But beyond that, what is really super outstanding about the course is the content, which is so interesting for anyone interested at all in how the law is made or what the law is at all (like literally everyone has had to have wondered about jaywalking at some point), and also the way in which he engages everyone in the classroom. Each class is like a session where we ask a bunch of questions and collectively learn about the law with Prof Felter. The big elephant in the room is the time commitment for the course. Admittedly, the course has a good deal of reading and assignments, and it's hard to spend less than 6 hours a week on average, even at a minimum, on the course. I think most people will find it worthwhile (evidenced by the other reviews). It is just such an enriching course that even though one might have doubts about joining at the beginning, this is the course to take.

Professor Ken Felter is the star and crown jewel of the tutorial program, by my definition, for a number of reasons. First of all, he's a retired partner at a law firm, so he has a bunch of industry experience. He is extremely dedicated to the course and helping his students. He is extremely accessible for office hours and answering a bunch of questions. But beyond that, what is really super outstanding about the course is the content, which is so interesting for anyone interested at all in how the law is made or what the law is at all (like literally everyone has had to have wondered about jaywalking at some point), and also the way in which he engages everyone in the classroom. Each class is like a session where we ask a bunch of questions and collectively learn about the law with Prof Felter. The big elephant in the room is the time commitment for the course. Admittedly, the course has a good deal of reading and assignments, and it's hard to spend less than 6 hours a week on average, even at a minimum, on the course. I think most people will find it worthwhile (evidenced by the other reviews). It is just such an enriching course that even though one might have doubts about joining at the beginning, this is the course to take. Prof Felter also has so many stories up his sleeve from his decades of experience, it is a delight to be in the class. Just be someone who's ready to commit some time and participate in the class.

When taking 985, think of it as a full course commitment––as it doesn't meet every week, it may be tempting to think it's okay to think of it as not very time consuming, but know that you will make your life a lot easier by prioritizing the course as a class itself, rather than just thinking of the thesis as a side project. Doing research takes time, this class will make your spring much easier by forcing you to get started early, but don't take it for granted!Finally, if you can, try to get into Kiran's seminar––we couldn't have been more lucky this semester! Kiran is an amazing human, incredibly supportive and knowledgeable about the thesis writing process.

I don't think multiple choice is the best way to exanimate here since it doesn't give students opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge through work, and it gives zero forgiveness for situations like when student gets initial calculation wrong but does all following calculations wrong (except based on the first initial calculation, so in MP exam they'd get no credit even though they used correct methods). with that said, at least it's better than 1010b in the spring (I think multiple choice exams make up like 90% of grade for spring version of 1010b), and the professor for off–cycle 1010b goes above and beyond for his students. He's extremely responsive to questions from students and is generally a kind person",0.9827,"I came into this class very excited because I loved macro and thought it would be a great building of theory on top of the foundations I learned in EC10B. However, as I began the course, there were so many opportunities to get lost and become confused with the course material. My first issue with the course is that lectures are not recorded. I understand that some professors do this because it is a hassle and/or they want students to attend class in person, but I found it literally impossible to keep up with lectures in person. Usually when I do the readings for a class, the lectures make a ton of sense. However, there was so much disconnect between readings to lecture slides to what the professor was actually teaching. Lecture slides were often extremely confusing and unclear and there were several times that the professor would go off on random tangents deriving random equations on the board and it was really difficult to follow along. In classes, it sometimes felt like he was talking to himself because no one was understanding what he was saying. I’m not sure if lecture recording would have helped much, but I think they definitely would have been a useful tool to look back on since there were so many additional details in lecture. Next up is section. I would go to section every week, and every week my TF would start the class saying that he was super tired and didn’t want to be there. I get it, I am tired too, and I don’t particularly want to be here either, but sometimes we just have to push through. It is evident that my TF put effort into preparing for section, but again, maybe because of how section was structured, I didn’t get much out of it. It was difficult to follow along and it felt like a lot of bouncing all over the place. My biggest issue with the class is how it is graded. As an Econ concentrator, I am used to exams being weighted very heavily on the final grade. It sucks, but it is how it is. However, almost every component of this class is based on multiple choice/ fill in numbers??? That means if you mess up one little equation, you get the entire answer wrong and there is no opportunity for partial credit. Going with this, questions often built on top of each other. So if you got one multiple choice answer wrong, there is a good shot you would get some of the subsequent ones wrong as well. On the midterm and the final, I found these exams extremely difficult for no reason. Usually for Econ courses, understanding the “big picture” ideas is the most important part of the course and you should be able to figure out most other things if you understand those overarching concepts. However, this was not the case in this course. Thomas pulled out random graphs that he has maybe showed once in class and put them on the exam. He would ask questions about authors from readings we barely talked about. Numeric questions all built off of each other, so if you got one question wrong because of a silly calculation error, you likely got several in a row wrong. This type of model makes it seem like the course is testing your ability to do perfect math and memorize silly little details instead of actually gaining a solid understanding of macroeconomic theory, which I feel like defeats the entire purpose of the course. That being said, exams were extremely difficult and no matter how much I studied, I still didn’t feel prepared. I hate writing bad reviews for courses but I really had an unpleasant experience in this course. I know that the 1010s are hard, but this was unnecessarily difficult for what it was. I thought 1010A was hard, but exams and grading were fair if you understood the course material well. I did not feel the same way about this course and don’t think I’m getting much out of it which is a shame. Thomas and the teaching staff are wonderful people, but I think the course definitely needs some restructuring.",-0.9666,,0.0,112062,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Economics,Economics,,Social Sciences,,Lecture,Intermediate Macroeconomics

First of all, Ed Glaeser is amazing. The policy discussions he starts every lecture with are very interesting and valuable — not only does he motivate that day's lecture, but he also references so many things that only he could, from his many (famous) friends and his own fascinating research/policy experiences to personal anecdotes. Hearing from him and reading about him, this guy deserves a Nobel in the next few decades. The economics of cities (Ed's area of study) sounds boring, but trust me — it's fascinating when you apply 1011a concepts to it. Have fun! Ed successfully inspired me to at least consider econ grad school.Some argue he lectures too fast — but all you need to get from lecture are the key concepts. He moves quickly through math on the board for a reason — it's not important that you follow along, since you no doubt already have the ability to easily replicate the derivative–bashing yourself. He moves quickly through the unimportant stuff and emphasizes the right things. Trust him.Most importantly, get to know Ed. You're at Harvard to build relationships, and this is a great one to have — more important than a grade will ever be. (Speaking of, don't stress about the grade — getting an A is hard, but an A– is easy if you are competent enough.) This class, more than anything, taught me how to *think* like an economist (and believe me, I thought I already knew how to do that!). Ed genuinely made me a smarter person, and what more could I ask for?By far the worst part of this class is the ugly algebra and calculus, but just power through it, especially on the problem sets. Don't spend too much time on the psets because they are completion based — you'll only not get a 100 (the possibilities are 100, 50, and 0) if you attempt so little of it so poorly that you couldn't argue for a 100 with a straight face. Just put in enough effort to derive the pedagogical value from the psets.The modeling projects should be fun, but it really depends on the TF who writes them. The exams are very, very hard, but they are fair. Just remember that they are heavily curved. In fact, the exams being long helps you — you can answer the questions you know, and let the curve take care of the questions you leave blank. And economic intuition always scores points, even if you don't have time for the math the question really calls for.In summary, this class is very, very hard. I'll be honest — I stressed more about this class than about Math 55. But don't let that dissuade you. It's worth it. Your grade will be fun — the curve is generous. Seemingly Ed's sole purpose in life now that he has done so much impactful research is to attract talent to the field of economics — to show talented math and physics students that econ is more than just the ""silly"" graphs from Ec 10. If you have any trace of that talent and analytical brain, you will take away a lot from this course. You'll see how economics really is a STEM subject, and no matter how far down the pure math rabbit hole you are, trust me — you'll enjoy all of the mathematical modeling.",0.9984,"This course is very poorly organized, and its purpose is not to teach students the material, but to intimidate them, The problem sets are doable but since there is no quantifiable feedback on them, you are not prepared for exams and projects which have too high expectations and are very harshly graded with medians of 50%. The midterm (due in 1h 15 min) was longer than a pset (due in a week), so I really don't see its purpose: it doesn't test your knowledge, but only how to get as many points as possible in a short time. Also there are no deadline extensions so beware of that: you can't be sick in this class. Get ready to pull all nighters when you have a problem set and a modeling project in the same week. This class is just harsh for no reason. I really love the material and i learned a lot in the class, but I feel like the stress and disappointment of getting low grades and sleepless nights because there are no extensions are just unnecessary.",-0.9575,,0.0,120711,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Economics,Economics,,Social Sciences,,Lecture,Intermediate Microeconomics: Advanced

It introduces you to a new way of thinking, and the material you go over is actually very interesting. The only thing I will say is that some of the lectures can be a little boring as it can get into pretty dense math, but you really don't truly need to understand the complex math and its proofs. As long as you understand the major conceptual takeaways you will be fine. Definitely not much work outside of class as there were only 3 psets all year (1 per month), each  of which was based on completion. Each one took 3 hours max, and that was because I cared about actually getting the answers right, and being pretty thorough. Additionally, every student has to take notes for one lecture and then write a page about your takeaways, and my only qualm is that this was pretty harshly graded given that they give us almost no info on what they expected. Thus, I would really make sure you write these in depth. Finally, most of your grade (75%) will depend on the final project which is also not much work as they do a good job of spreading out the milestones. It is a group project which is nice too, so doing it with your friends is really chill and you get full ownership over choosing your topic. If you choose a fun topic, it will actually be enjoyable.

This is the most disorganized course I have ever taken at this college. If you are AM/Ec, I would just take Stat 111 than this storm of a class. With 1126, notation gets out of control fast, and only skilled professors are able to dispel confusion around a topic by improving the language of the notes. Unfortunately, this class struggles to find ground with the lecture notes and easily sends students rethinking their place in the course. The lectures themselves were not of much help either given the vague language. Regarding homework, rarely did the questions in the problem sets align smoothly with what was taught in lecture. Most problem sets contained questions that could only be figured out if you went to office hours and discovered an obscure math trick. Thank GOD the CAs were real ones. The tests were much worse. This is less so for the midterm, but there were very few materials posted to help prepare for the final exam. The only hint provided was during section on what the final exam could possibly cover. There were no practice exams, no meaningful practice questions for the main topics that were actually on the final, and the answer solutions for the minimal practice questions provided were only tentative solutions with little explanation. Also, the average for the midterm was a 40%, even lower than the 1011a midterm average, how is that even possible?! I just don't understand why this school cannot teach econometrics well.

As someone who was interested in exploring behavioral economics beyond the often discussed topic of nudging, this course provided a great overview of the work that exists at the intersection of morality/psychology and economics. While there were certainly references to money and spending, the thrust of this course really emphasized the view that economics is a way of studying incentives and behavior.  It also required a fairly low time commitment –– much less than Ec1010a –– and had an amazingly dedicated teaching staff. While the insights from this course often left me fascinated and are certainly applicable to a number of academic fields (and even to real life), I would not recommend this course to someone who is not interested in a survey–type course –– most of the lectures are focused on describing economic papers.

The typical lecture consists of stating an interesting hypothesis (eg religious people tend to vote against national redistribution) and then going through ~ 2 studies (in a bit of excruciating detail) that prove the hypothesis. Because of this, it often feels like the bulk of what you need to learn is stated in the first 15 minutes of class (but it's a very interesting first 15 minutes). Week to week, the course is pretty minimal work (1 pset every 2 weeks) and no readings. Because of this, it's easy to call this class a ""gem,"" but don't be entirely fooled— the final was worth 50% of the grade, and it consisted of fairly confusing multiple choice questions (you could pick from A, B, A or C, all of the above, none of the above). With only 29 questions, it's easy to see how someone could do poorly on the exam and tank their grade (each question was worth over 1.5% of your overall grade, after all).

By the end of the semester, over half of the cohort completely stopped attending lectures because of the pedagogical approach in lecture. The visiting professor taught the course in a way with a design that almost seemed to gleefully mock students when they would not understand the material, which is antithetical to teaching. Many students have talked about suffering because of the almost hostile, mocking tone that the visiting professor would take on at times when speaking to them.

I think Stat 210 would help, since we referenced results and ideas from that class pretty frequently. You don't need any economics to understand what's going on, but a lot of the application questions Neil gave on psets were macro–related. Assignments had 2 theory questions and 2 applied questions each, which I thought was a pretty good balance. They helped solidify why we use certain models and why certain properties and assumptions matter. There were only five psets, and we were able to drop 2 of them and use extensions on 2 others. There were no midterms, but there was a final that had an applied section that we did at home and a theory section that we took in person during the scheduled final exam time.

The workload is pretty easy. You have a bit of reading, maybe 2 hours maximum per week if you are really reading everything (most weeks <1hr of reading) and a 200–300 word response essentially graded on completion. You also have to teach one of the sections, but this doesn't really count for any part of your grade from what I see. As for the midterm paper, only 1500 words, but beware that they typically give out bad grades on it. Seems like they should provide more guidance rather than just giving people a bad grade. The final paper was pretty grueling to write as the topics didn't seem to me to be super interesting. Overall, the course was pretty interesting. You get a pretty diverse set of perspectives from the readings and the lectures are pretty enjoyable. By the end of the semester though, it seems like we are talking about the same things over and over, which gets boring.

Very analytically heavy with some computational components, but material is presented sufficiently well with a good support staff. This class is (quite literally but also compliment–wise) a must–take for any prospective engineer.PROFESSOR: (5/5)★★★★★ (5/5) | PERSONALITY★★★★★ (5/5) | KNOWLEDGEABILITY★★★★★ (5/5) | COMMUNICATIONBoris is an extremely personable and engaging professor. In a field of study where it is common for professors to 1) present topics in a dull and boring way, disparate from real–world application; 2) lack the ability to put concepts into digestible, layman terms; and 3) hand–wave a lot of concepts away when they lack current understanding, Boris stands as a pillar for mechanical engineers everywhere, which is appreciated tenfold considering the fact that Mechanical Systems is REQUIRED for prospective mechanical engineers. He is humorous, demonstrates great expertise on the course material, and is highly communicative and accommodating on Slack.LECTURE: (4/5)★★★☆☆ (3/5) | ENGAGEMENT★★★★★ (5/5) | CONTENTOf course, being fully lecture style means that there is not a lot of hands–on or personal engagement required from you. The lectures are definitely worth attending as they're very comprehensive and understanding tends to work better when in an environment where you're surrounded by others trying to understand the same material. All slides are posted on Canvas and lectures can be attended on Zoom, but don't make the mistake of skipping class because you will learn much better in person.SECTION: (4/5)★★★★☆ (4/5) | USEFULNESSWhen I say ""section"", I refer to office hours. These are HIGHLY important for anyone taking this class; unfortunately, everyone also realizes this and nearly everyone goes to office hours, which means it can sometimes be difficult to get help on your own because the TAs have a lot of people to help (though this will be solved if you attend multiple office hours!).HOMEWORK: (5/5)★★★★☆ (4/5) | DIFFICULTY (HARD)★★★★☆ (4/5) | TIME EXPECTATION (LONG)★★★★☆ (4/5) | LECTURE PREPARATION★★★★★ (5/5) | FEEDBACKMany difficult problems that are built on concepts learned and practiced in class, with some details added on top for critical thinking and problem–solving. The problem sets are manageable if you go to office hours, but I HIGHLY recommend you form a PSet group to tackle problems, because sometimes these problems are a doozy. Progression of difficulty is steady but towards the end, can be exhausting (prepare to show A LOT of work). TAs give incredible feedback on Gradescope that helps you understand why and where you went wrong in your work.EXAMS: (3/5)★★★★★ (5/5) | DIFFICULTY (VERY HARD)★★★★☆ (4/5) | LENIENCY★★★★★ (5/5) | FEEDBACKExams are too long to be done in time for most and aren't curved, although they will be graded with a lot of leniency to give credit wherever possible. I personally felt underprepared for both exams and I wished there were either less problems on the tests or extended time on the tests.LABS: (3/5)★★★★☆ (4/5) | DIFFICULTY (VERY HARD)★★★★☆ (4/5) | ENGAGEMENT★★★★☆ (4/5) | COURSE RELEVANCELabs had interesting physical, hands–on components and set–ups, but the problem this year was that Steve left (he abandoned us for MIT) and a lot of the underlying code that enabled the labs were hard to troubleshoot or didn't work. We were able to make due but in general the labs were very finicky. They did reflect course content pretty well when they did work, however.PROJECT: (4/5)★★☆☆☆ (2/5) | DIFFICULTY (EASY)★★★★★ (5/5) | ENGAGEMENT ★★★★★ (5/5) | COURSE RELEVANCEFun final project that is essentially for completion— designing a suspension system to soften the landing of a falling carriage containing an egg, and presenting it at the end of the semester.

Of all the courses in EE I have taken, none has been as effective as ES152 in instilling an intrinsic curiosity and desire to truly understand how things work. This course is very challenging. Be aware that this class is called ES152: Circuits, Devices, and Transduction, which Gage will point out should probably be three separate courses. That means that material which should be covered in three semesters (or more) will be covered in one. It's a big ask, and Gage being as dedicated and passionate about the material as he is, will not skimp or shy away from unturning as many stones as possible in this one semester. Don't be afraid though. It is one hell of a ride. The lectures are always focused on establishing intuition and Gage has an incredible ability and level of patience to explain concepts in a step–by–step way, building on your understanding and connecting sub–concepts into full topics.  The lectures are so entertaining and useful that this is a class where you would never want to miss a lecture. They are very engaging (pun intended) and Gage even spends hours outside of class making MATLAB simulations of MOSFETS and electron orbitals just to help us have a better visual. Homework was split into analyticals and labs. They come as a set, intended to be given once a week/two weeks. Fair warning, each homework is very long, ranging from 20–30hrs on average. However, the homework is full of excellent explanations and guidance, and although you may go pale seeing subparts a–t for a single question, know that by the end of it, you will be amazed by how deeply you understand the concept that question was targeting. Labs were excellent. They covered a good variety of material like audio amplifiers, DACs, and semiconductor devices. Georgios, who I hope will still be a TF for the course, did an incredible job redesigning these labs last year with Gage. Georgios is a gem for the course and has some of the best advice, understanding, and explanations for course material. If he's available in lab or outside of class, he is a wonderful asset to the course and is a great person to discuss questions and concepts with. Speaking of teaching staff, the TFs were truly a dream team. I have never witnessed a course where all the TFs were as all–around excellent as in ES152. Georgios, TomHenry, and Jalil were the Holy Trinity. TomHenry was a wizard at section. I was amazed at how succinct and intuitively he could explain concepts. Interesting to note is that TomHenry has a more traditional background in how he understands the material, meaning his equations match the textbooks. This was a nice juxtaposition to the less traditional way Gage explained material in lecture. Both approaches have their benefits so getting to hear different angles, one in lecture and one in section, really was a powerful combo. Jalil did a great job leading lab and helping us with debugging any issues. Overall, all the TFs were incredibly enthusiastic, capable, and generous with offering time to help us whenever needed.Lastly, as you have probably come to realize in this long response, Gage is an extraordinary professor. I doubt you could find a student who would describe Gage as anything less than exceptional. No matter if it was the beginning of the course, the weekend, some weekday at 3am, in class, after class, whenever and wherever, Gage is always full of energy and passion for teaching. His dedication toward his students is unparalleled, allowing us to slack him any time we had questions (he responds fast) even late at night, and making it easy to schedule one–on–one time with him if we needed help or just wanted to discuss something. The lectures, homework, and even the final exam were custom catered toward the class. I think Gage takes pride in making the homework questions unique yet comprehensive. For example. the final exam took us step by step in creating a display monitor which was so cool, and it was an amazing moment having Gage guide us in proving to ourselves that with the knowledge gained in this course, we could do things that seemed impossible at our level, like designing circuits to make our computer or phone screens. Gage is an excellent teacher but his dedication to getting to know the class and helping us with problems big or small and doing it with such joy made him the best professor I've ever had. Sometimes, we forget that like any professor, he's probably juggling research, meetings, conferences, and his personal life alongside this class, but it was undeniable how much he prioritized this class and every student in the class. This wasn't something he had to do, but he does it because of the person he is and because he understands that teaching and learning is not just about giving lectures and doing the bare minimum. Every student learns at a different pace and in a different way, and Gage made sure we never felt short of having the right support and help however and whenever we needed it.

Lina's lectures get straight to the point, and she distills the information necessary to intuitively understand problems and concepts as well as the best guidelines for solving problems. The textbook by Astrom and Murray follows the class material faithfully, especially in the first half of the course. I would definitely recommend doing the textbook readings before the lectures so that Lina's teaching will reinforce material you've already been exposed to and have pondered on.In terms of assignments, there are roughly 8 psets, once each week or every two weeks, and they are fairly written, covering the material according to the lectures. Most of the time, the psets will have MATLAB integrated, so it would be helpful to at least cover a crash course into MATLAB and gain some familiarity with the control toolbox before or at the start of the course. There will be sections that will help provide this on–ramp, but it's honestly easier and more effective to take care of it yourself beforehand. If anything, you can do the training earlier and ask any lingering questions in section the first couple weeks.Besides the psets, there are two short labs (very guided, don't require more than 30min to conduct the lab and roughly 1–2hrs to do the lab report) in each half of the semester. The other assignment is the course project. This is done in about ~4 stages, called milestones, throughout the semester. The teams are picked by Lina, but you do get to send her your preferences for partners. The project objectively is time–consuming and difficult since it requires the knowledge acquired in just the last couple weeks to be applied to a control problem you study with your group. Now, depending on the commitment and work distribution of your team, the difficulty can range from challenging but manageable to extremely time consuming (i.e. expect a few all–nighters). Lina is very understanding and will provide a lot of help and guidance throughout the project, so please don't feel intimidated. By the end, you will feel that the project is probably your proudest accomplishment in the course. The project truly does provide a healthy challenge and is going to greatly help your understanding and confidence in the material you learn, but like anything you study, it will take time to digest and there will be a lot of mistakes along the way. Try to stay optimistic and know that all groups end up doing very well by the culmination of the project!Lastly, there is one midterm and a final. I think the format of it changes from year to year, but in this past year the midterm was done in class with a handwritten cheat sheet. The final was a 3hr take home exam. Both were very reasonable. Be sure to look at the practice exam Lina will send because they represent the exams very well. For a few last notes, the class definitely will feel like a math course at times, but the math is based on a few key linear algebra topics like rank and finding eigenvalues. It's nothing extensive, so even if you don't have the best math background coming in, these are concepts you can still pick up. Plus, if you are an engineering concentrator, having concrete examples and applications will greatly help in your understanding, in ways pure math classes were lacking. For EE concentrators, this class pairs excellently with ES152. Truly, I cannot think of a better class pairing in the same semester as ES155 and ES152. The concepts overlap so nicely and the knowledge you gain in one class will help reinforce what you learn in the other. The best benefit is getting to learn bode plots and transfer functions in ES152 just before they are covered in ES155. Overall, ES155 is a very solid course and if the appropriate time is taken to understand the material, you will most likely have a great appreciation and fascination with controls that stays with you beyond the class.",0.9992,"Overall: Controlling systems via feedback, i.e., taking mathematical models of physical/biological/mechanical/economic systems and using feedback of the output to create inputs that allow us to control the output.

It teaches some applications like band structure, rotating wave approximation, quantum info, etc., but I found those to be rather pointless since many people plan to take solid–state, AMO, and QI anyways, which cover those topics more thoroughly. By taking this course instead of a more rigorous grad QM course, I felt underprepared for the other course I took this semester and future physics courses. PSETs and exams are easy but often algebraically tedious, which made them just busywork. The grading also made me feel like I had gone back to high school after graduating undergrad––it's been a hot sec since I've seen points being taken off for not showing enough work even though my answer was correct and I understood what I was doing. But to be fair, the course assignments/sections are very pedagogical and probably useful if you don't have a solid undergrad QM background. And the easier, biweekly PSETs allow for more time spent on research (unlike physics251a where PSETs are weekly).You're required to take this course if you're in QSE, but I would suggest stalling until your later years or until this requirement is relaxed (probably unlikely though).",0.9796,,0.0,,0.0,220701,Primarily for Graduate Students,Engineering Sciences,Engineering Sciences,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Foundations of Quantum Mechanics

Prof Liu is a very effective lecture –– it feels like he's put a lot of thought into what he is going to present and teaches in a very clear and understandable manner. He is always happy to stop for questions anytime. The lab is super interesting. This year it was tissue clearing of mouse brain sections and then laser confocal microscopy to perform 3D connectivity mapping (basically 3D imaging and reconstruction of the neural structure of the mouse brain). Very cool experience, which was a highlight of the course.Assignments were short prelab/postlab reports, and then 'journal club' midterm presentations where you will present with a group on one of about seven papers provided by Prof Liu. He emphasized time and time again that if you wanted to get anything out of the course, it is vital to read the papers. It is through this exercise that you come to truly understand where the field is now. It is quite easy to just read your own paper and present on it, but I would stand with the professor on this account –– make the extra effort to read as many papers as you can. Your grade does not depend on this, but your understanding will definitely deepen. I found the presentations to be good assignments, however because everyone must present on their papers, it did end up taking up a significant portion of class time, which was a little unfortunate. Also, *do not go over the time limit in your presentations*. Prof Liu is very strict about them and likes to keep class on time. Final projects were fun, I liked the idea of having us write NIH–style grant proposals for novel research.

Engagement is 3/5 because it's a lecture style, there's not gonna be a lot of back and forth, but the content of the lecture is interesting enough to keep you focused for an hour and a half— I know it kept my attention that long the entire semester. Wish there could've been more demonstration tools; it's very chalkboard heavy.HOMEWORK: (5/5)★★★★☆ (4/5) | DIFFICULTY (HARD)★★★★☆ (4/5) | TIME EXPECTATION (LONG)★★★★☆ (4/5) | LECTURE PREPARATION★★★★★ (5/5) | FEEDBACKFour to five difficult problems per problem set but are both conceptually relevant and interesting. I am a big fan of the questions because they're interesting to think about spatially. It is worthwhile to have a PSet group or go to office hours. EXAMS: (4/5)★★★★★ (5/5) | DIFFICULTY (VERY HARD)★★☆☆☆ (2/5) | LENIENCY★★★★★ (5/5) | FEEDBACKExams have the right amount of difficulty. Professor himself stated he's very strict on exam grading.

It's like everything I've learned in class, I actually got to use. In the future, this will come in handy. You start out playing around with the robot virtually and in person, then you get to moving the arm to a position by adjusting its angles, then you get to moving the arm to a position by adjusting its velocities, then you get the arm to trace out a path through a maze, and then you get to make the arm pick up a block and place it on a platform using image processing. This class FEELS cool.",0.9962,This class was very very interesting!

I've taken workshops before at Harvard, but was blown away at the amount of thought that Claire puts into her feedback — she will push you so much as a writer. If you get into any workshop of hers, you will not regret taking it! With all creative writing workshops, you get what you put in, so make sure that you have enough time in your schedule to put time into writing and workshopping other people's pieces in order for maximum impact.",0.964,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

I'm someone who loves to read (but doesn't always make time for it) and this class forces you to read something each week. The weekly discussion posts allow you to think a little more deeply about the text if you're not a talker. The assignments besides those are quite manageable: 2 essays, an imitation assignment (where you write two poems on the same subject in different forms and reflect on it) and an in class final. The in class final was honestly really fun as weird as that is to say. The time crunch forces you to run with whatever ideas pop into your head first and ~1.5 hrs later you've written 3 full essays.

On the one hand, the syllabus is very well crafted and the whole notion of ""reading politically"" is one that has interested me for a while. Many of our discussions in class were fascinating and probing. And the class was just a lot of fun, partially a result of having a lot of great students in the seminar.However, the course suffered from two main issues in my year:(1) We didn't get any grades back until the last day of class. This is partially a function of there just not being many assignments, but likely this can be rectified in the future.(2) More importantly though, while Professor Menon is awesome, super cool and smart, I don't think she's amazing at facilitating discussion. In nearly every class, significant proportion of discussion would come down to us discussing her opinions on the secondary sources / novels. In some cases, this was fine because it felt like there was some back–and–forth. But in some situations it felt she was sort of forcing her own perspective onto the class. I don't have a problem with professors expressing their views per se, but I think in certain cases here it came at the detriment to open, productive discussion. This is all to say that I think this class should just be taught as a lecture where Prof. Menon delivers arguments on the text. You could either do that where you spend the first 45 mins of seminar with her giving the argument and the rest in discussion, or just as a full–blown lecture class. That version of the course would be fantastic, I think, because Prof. Menon has clearly thought deeply about all of these issues and she could give the full version of these arguments instead of haphazardly presenting them in seminar. So if it's taught as a lecture, I'd definitely take it. If a seminar, it's still a really interesting class with good readings but it might prove a bit frustrating.",0.9933,Take this class if you want to tackle hard questions and use literature as a portal into understanding how information and media is consumed today–it is a class so painfully relevant to the world today.

Even then, I might advise you to find a different, more applied class and dive into it from that side of things. I found it to be a pretty dry and pretty frustrating class. I am the kind of student who likes to read a good textbook; the assigned textbook for this course stinks. (The majority of the class agreed on this point, though one previous student reportedly ""loved it and read the whole thing""). You have to engage with the textbook in regular discussion posts. There's no lab component of the course, which is disappointing for a class on environmental chemistry. Lecture attendance is mandatory; lectures alternated between boring and confusing.A large portion of class energy and time is spent on student presentations, which are generally more interesting and informative than the lectures themselves. Still, student presentations are variable in quality and subject as they are on ""topics from the textbook;"" i.e. whatever that student decided they wanted to focus on for 5 minutes. I prefer not to have the most interesting part of the course feel up to chance and the good knowledge of my peers. There is little to no feedback on student presentations throughout the semester.The final semester project was meh. It was a group project and the groups were too large, so the typical mess of scheduling and priority conflict led to less–than–effective collaboration and less–than–equitable distribution of work. There's a final presentation as well as a final report; the report is 20+ pages (with figures), 1.2 space font. Who assigns 1.2 space font? The assignment was to take an element and relate it to environmental chemistry. Pretty open prompt. Not a lot of helpful feedback in professor consultation sessions or on our presentation. As you might expect, the project had variable outcomes of questionable quality.The best part about the course was the section, which always shed light on the confounding lecture material and provided examples relevant to the homework. Sadly, the TF that taught it this semester will not be doing so in the future, so all bets are off.The course feels like it's being taught 20 years ago. I suspect the professor of believing that the world and students have changed too much in recent decades and that students should learn the good old–fashioned way with a textbook and lectures.I think I learned some environmental chemistry concepts that will apply to my future concentration and studies. I wish I could've learned them in a different class. Take a class with a lab or with more engaging material even if it's more time–consuming; save yourself the headache.",0.987,"Take this class.

This topic really was quite interesting, but maybe for only a week or two. After that, I was personally over the topic. The second topic was much more modern, we reviewed Graham Hancock and an episode of Ancient Apocalypse from Netflix. I found this topic to be much more interesting throughout the whole unit. It led to some great in–class discussions and some good avenues for paper topics. The third unit is all about researching a conspiracy theory of your own choice and allows for a lot more freedom when it comes to sources, research, and ideas. Throughout the course, the professor gave phenomenal feedback on each response exercise, rough draft, and final paper which really helped improve my writing.Whilst I am not a fan of expos in general, I would recommend this class as a top choice for expos 20.(Please, for your own sake, do not procrastinate the drafts of your papers until 2 nights before they are due like I did.)",0.9755,This seems like one of the worst expos.

TAKE IT!!!!! Ranking this class as my first choice was the best decision I made this semester. Dr. Gold is the biggest reason why it is so worth it to take this class. She is so amazing, brilliant, and helpful. Through the span of the four months I took this class, I feel my writing has improved so much. Dr. Gold gives SO MUCH helpful feedback (comments on your essays, video feedback where she literally goes through essay and talks about her feedback, and conferences). I also just love the readings she assigns. Very light reading compared to other Expos courses. We do not have readings every class, but when we do, they are so interesting and rewarding to read. Dr. Gold's taste in selecting the reading assignments for this class is superb to say the least. Like I would actually enjoy reading this class's readings just for fun during my free time. And genuinely being interested in this class and the readings made writing so much more fun and easy. For our research paper at the end of the semester, we were able to pick any topic we wanted to research, and getting to write about a topic I was passionate about and invested in made me want to produce my best work possible, not for the grade or the class but for my self and my own fulfillment. You definitely have to put in effort into this class, but as I said, this class makes you WANT to. Since everybody in this class enjoyed it and was passionate about it, we all had so much fun in class together. I probably made the most friends in this class out of all of my classes. Getting to talk to Dr. Gold is also so much fun too and interesting. (These are the type of professor–student relationships you imagine when thinking of Harvard.) Overall, this class is just so perfect; I have no criticisms. If you are looking for a smooth transition to college–level writing from high school–level writing that is both fun and rewarding, THIS CLASS IS FOR YOU.

The readings are incredibly interesting even if you aren't interested in discussing feminism or any social issues (which was the case for me, and I feel a lot more comfortable discussing these issues). Dr. Gold doesn't cold call on you if you aren't comfortable, and she really tries to understand your learning and writing style and makes the class a comfortable space for discussion. She has a clear rubric that she grades off from and has a lot more assignments and participation to help your grade, so the two major essays don't completely determine your grade. The capstone project is a lot better to do and allows you to flex your creativity and apply the topics you've learned to the real world rather than writing a third essay. She is very quick to respond to any messages on Slack as well and is extremely funny and engaging. Be sure to utilize the Writing Center or any outside opinion or help edit your essays since class mainly talks about the readings and discussing how to write essays better. She gives you lots of time to work on your essays, just don't procrastinate.

This has been my favorite class during my first semester. The assignments are fun and are flexible to your interests even though we have specific reading materials to focus on.  The readings in this course were extremely interesting. Each reading assignment was a different court case that we then discussed in class and the discussions were incredibly rich. This class will challenge you and the assignments will take work and effort but the entire process is incredibly rewarding. The comments Ross gives are fantastic. I've used them to guide each of my drafts and final essays. The feedback served as a sounding board for how I was doing, and I internalized those comments. I mentioned at the start of the year that I wanted to know when my essay was quality without the use of a rubric or someone else, and through the comments I've been able to point out issues with my paper on my own now at the end of the semester.The most rewarding to me was our discussion section. The in–class experience was my favorite part of the class. The classroom environment that Ross, my peers, and I created over the semester has been one of my favorite aspects of the Harvard experience so far. I appreciate how supportive and respectful the discussions are and, the student–led aspect of our discussions has led to many personal revelations, closer relationships, and overall understandings across multiple perspectives. On the instructor level, Dr. Ross Martin is genuinely one of the best instructors I've ever had. He is very intentional in what he says and the way he runs his classroom. You can tell that in every action and sentence, he wants the best for his students and the people he interacts with. I needed that in my first semester here. The amount of care and kindness that he has shown to me and the rest of my peers is unmatched. I am so grateful to have been a part of this class and been his student.In terms of preparation, I think it is good to have experience in writing research papers in high school. I think my high school preparation helped me a lot in transitioning to the expos writing experience. However, if you feel confident about your abilities in writing papers generally, I don't think you need experience in constitutional law at all. I had none and this was my favorite class!",0.9982,"Don't get me wrong... this class is difficult. But not because it is badly taught or disorganized.

The Capstone Project was an innovative way for us to consider solutions to animal issues, as well as experience a non–traditional writing assignment. And the research paper!!! It was really great to be able to pick a topic of our choice from a broad prompt. This may sound crazy, but I actually worked on my research paper as a way to procrastinate other work – I was just so interested in the topic.

She gave her expectations, and if you did your best to meet them (displayed effort to follow her advice to improve) then you would get a good grade.

The workload for homework and readings was definitely manageable too. Overall, loved the class and Professor Zecca!

I feel like this class has truly changed me for the better – both as a public speaker and how I engage with my fellow classmates at Harvard. I came into the class already a relatively confident speaker,  although I had some areas I wanted to work on. From the very first round of speeches, I was absolutely blown away with how much I was already learning. Throughout the course, I learned how to become an evocative story teller, how to engage directly with the audience, speak on the spot, widen the range in both my vocal tone and body language, utilize the physical space on stage, work with slides and/or props, and weave numerous rhetorical devices into my speeches. At the same time,  each student was given the space to develop their own style, and everybody had at least one outstanding strength that they could share with the rest of the class (from comforting the audience, to projecting their voice, to bringing vulnerability to their speeches, to incorporating humor, and more). Kate and the class always provided helpful feedback that made each one of us a better speaker.  We would do short practice rounds after each speech to incorporate the feedback, and I would often be blown away at how much more impactful people's speeches would become. We also play fun warm up games to start each class (if you've ever done theater/drama, they're similar to those). They might seem silly at first, but they are in fact really helpful, particularly the improv exercises that prepare you for impromptu speaking. Last note on speaking: I really appreciated the space we were given to experiment with each speech. I never felt like I was ever going to be penalized if something fell flat, and making mistakes and figuring out feels most natural were pivotal in my development as an independent speaker and thinker. I was truly taking the class to LEARN, and I loved every moment of it.The class not only taught me about public speaking, but it also reminded me why I wanted to come to Harvard in the first place. Because Expos 40 is an elective, people from all concentrations take the class. I only knew a couple of other classmates coming into the class, and I am so glad to have met such an interesting and kind group of people. I loved listening to everyone's speeches – their various perspectives, passions, hopes, fears, and goals. I learned as much from my peers as I did from the structural parts of the course, and I don't think I could have had that with any other class. Come in with an open mind and intention to be an engaged peer, and you will get so much from this course.1000% recommend! Lottery, and lottery again if you need to!

This class was incredible, easily, hands down, not even close, my favourite class I've taken. I'm CS through–and–through, took this with 165 and 153 to help balance my load, but this was the highlight of my semester easily. The class community is unmatched in any class I've seen at Harvard – I have a huge amount of respect for everyone else in my section, and also am incredibly glad I got to meet and hear so much from them about their lives, beliefs, values and opinions. Harvard might be the worst rated institution for free speech or whatever we are getting flamed for in the papers, but EXPOS 40 makes a mockery of that. Both in speeches but also just general discussions at starts of classes/around breaks (normally took a lunch break for 10 mins in the middle of 12–2pm class, we were in Lowell screening room so could go get food from dhall as a group which was 10/10), there was an enormous range of topics discussed. Why you should travel, why you should get a credit card, a case for ethical non–monogamy, we should abolish social security, we should get rid of extra time on exams, how to dance Folklorico, how to erg, how to secure the first date, why long distance dating is underrated, an intro to sports betting, intro to meditation and mindfulness, history of the Persian empire (That wasn't quite the title, I apologize we had a lot of great speeches, I loved this one Hayden, you'll just have to give it again :) and so many more. All the speeches of introductions. All the improv sessions, all the warmup dance nonsense and vocal warmups. So many highlights from one class.Now I have to talk about the star of the show. I wouldn't have traded Zach for anyone, any other class, no chance. Zach brought this class to life in a way that I truly didn't think was possible. His energy is infectious, he is a fountain of insane and random knowledge, funny quotes and general good vibes. At the same time, he is an excellent public speaking teacher – I really felt that I have developed a lot as a speaker throughout the class, and it's even more evident in some of my classmates. I was very pleasantly surprised by my improvement, but I was staggered by how much some of the others in the class improved, their first and final speech were night and day, incomparable, it was incredible to see.If this review is ever viewed given the new system, lottery for this class. If you don't get in, put yourself on the waitlists. I got in in the second week of the semester from the waitlist, and I can't express how glad I am that I did. It was the most welcoming and supportive learning community I've been a part of at Harvard, and it was an incredible experience that I would wholeheartedly recommend to anyone here.

This class was the absolute academic highlight of my freshman fall. Staying two nights at the forest once a month was such a cool and unique experience, and I bonded so much with everyone else in the class. There is a lot being thrown at you on the class days, but is balanced out nicely by how much fun you are having. Dave is an excellent teacher and truly like a father figure to everyone in the class. He makes the experience so special. You also get to have only 3 classes the rest of the month,  since this class doesn't meet regularly, which takes a HUGE load off academically and is a nice way to get adjusted. The homework is minimal. There is reading to do before each weekend. The only submitted work (aside from the final paper) is to submit a short writeup answering a couple questions, due 1 week after each trip. These are very low–stakes, chill assignments that don't take long, and you don't have any submitted homework at all the rest of the month. The final paper was legit but manageable and we had a lot of time to work on it. The forest was absolutely beautiful, the stars were incredible, and it was so cool to get to go around and explore nature – great way to escape the Cambridge bubble and get outside. The accomodations are truly outstanding as well – you live in a huge house with tons of beds, tons of space, nice bathrooms and showers, an active kitchen, and tons and tons of free food and drink that is purchased for you to snack on. You really feel like it is your home and you have total free reign to live in the space. You also learn a lot over the course of this class! Getting off campus 1 weekend per month is really not a huge commitment and is honestly really good for you – I looked forward to those weekends more than anything. It felt like an escape from the stress of Harvard life and into a whole separate world. In conclusion – this is literally, like, the best class ever conceived.

He is also incredibly kind, and cares about students so deeply (in some ways, he resembles Leopold Bloom in his kindness and care for how others might feel).

If you're not interested in any, you'll find the class a bit abstract and vague. I personally loved this class and learned so much from it, but I had mixed feelings in that there was a lot of poetry I had to read and I wasn't honestly expecting that. I don't mind poetry, but when I have to read Oberiu absurdist pieces right after doing two problem sets when my brain is already fried, it can get kind of annoying, especially when you're someone who likes to get the right answer and find the ultimate meaning. I think the ultimate point of this class is that you'll never get that singular message from any work of literature, and that's okay (though you may or may not be satisfied with that answer, that deceptively simple message opens up a lot of room for further complexity and a diversity of interpretations). I really loved the creative aspect of this class and I got to use a lot of interesting theories, ideas, and concepts, and apply them to an assortment of things I got to write. I think you definitely get what you put into this class: this class has definitely showed me that I am still interested in literature (though not that much in poetry) and it has even convinced some of my peers to pursue comp lit or translation studies. The readings were a lot more than I expected, and although you could technically get away without doing them, you'll do yourself an injustice. The films, poems, novels that we read/watch are amazing and will introduce some good ideas. The professor is awesome and super passionate. Sometimes this class goes into very abstract concepts (like Benjamin's ""messianic language"") and it might feel like you're losing touch with reality, but it's kind of a nice break from the problem–solution oriented courses. However for some people it could be very unpleasant and intangible.

Going into this class, my attitude was something along the lines of “I’m going to really enjoy this class, and possibly find my calling in it.” Still not sure about the second half, but I was certainly right that I’d enjoy it. I learned a lot about agri science and systems in a setting that I wouldn’t otherwise have had the ability to. I’d had some spark of interest in agriculture and food prior to this class, but it was instrumental in building out that interest to something much more real. Partly because of 52Q, I applied to a food justice internship for the spring–fingers crossed for that!I think that Ann did a great job of broadening its scope beyond hard science; the majority of the readings were very accessible and many addressed indigenous food ethics & practices, cultural significance of food, and narratives about the science we were studying during class. Of course, I learned a ton about plant and food science as well. It's a pretty chill seminar as far as workload goes; roughly 2 hours of reading per week until week 10, with two very short essays during that time as well, plus one 8–ish–hour group final project.And, as a bonus, Ann brings a themed snack every week, which is especially helpful because it’s a 9am (or at least was this year) but you don’t have to eat breakfast before :)",0.9958,,0.0,"GEM!!! As far as first year seminars go, this has got to be up there with the best of them.

The course really challenges you to think of food holistically and from many schools of thought that value science as the key player.  The assignments are fun and relaxed, and the final group project (building an operational farm) was definitely a highlight of my semester.

We referenced quite a few interesting pieces of architecture, but I wish we spent more time dissecting the projects. In addition, a lot of the conversations and readings we had on architecture were western–oriented, and so it was disappointing to not see examples and references to non–western cultures.

The readings are definitely not always the easiest to understand but Quinn helped make everything much clearer in class and we had some super cool conversations.The teaching of this class is great—Quinn is one of the most dedicated, knowledgable, and friendly professors out there and is extremely chill and accommodating. At the same time, I felt like he cared a lot about each of our thoughts and was dedicated to helping us improve our understanding of philosophy, from (extremely!) thorough gradings to cool conversations. ESPECIALLY if you are on the more shy side, I encourage you to speak up as much as you can in class (it's ok to get things ""wrong""!!) and go to Quinn's office hours! He has really interesting insight and it honestly just feels good to express your beliefs, and the class starts feeling a little lopsided when only a few people dominate the conversation. Start your assignments early so you have time to chat about them with him. If you are thinking about taking this freshman seminar, I 100% encourage it, but definitely make sure to review the syllabus to ensure that you are interested in the readings—I admittedly didn't look too closely and had a different idea of the class than what it actually ended up being so some weeks felt drier to me because of that.

Please take it if you have any interest in race, racism, or the intersection of science and racism. Professor Fuente was an absolutely incredible teacher. From day one, he asked my peers and I questions that were genuinely very difficult to answer despite the answer seeming obvious when he first posed the question. I truly feel as though my conception of race and the history surrounding racism has been challenged thoroughly by this class, and I can confidently say that I think differently about these topics having taken this class. Each class I felt genuinely stumped by some of the questions we were asked to discuss, and it was exciting how discussions didn't just feel like synthesizing information from readings, but as though we were really trying to arrive at some sort of understanding regarding truly complex issues that wasn't yet obvious at the beginning of class. The way I thought about each reading transformed dramatically by the end of our discussions, which made them feel truly worthwhile. In fact, I can confidently say that this course was one of the most academically fulfilling parts of my semester. If you're looking for a class that will truly challenge you and force you to rethink much of how you conceive of concepts like race, this is the class for you. Furthermore, I'd really like to emphasize what a wonderful teacher Professor Fuente is. Each week, we were assigned a brief essay that reflected on the week's readings, and while this assignment wasn't supposed to be anything more than a summary of our thoughts going into the week's discussion, Professor Fuente took the time to leave thoughtful feedback on every single essay we submitted. Whether it was applauding the thinking I had done or pushing me to wrestle with the readings more, I always felt that Professor Fuente truly cared about what I had to say. I felt the same in class, as he truly gave each student the space to speak, even if we were simply posing more questions to the group. He remembered details we shared about ourself on the first day of class and brought them up when relevant throughout the semester, he took interest in our lives outside of school, and, all in all, he made it clear that he cared about our wellbeing which was very comforting being new on campus. As I've already said, he also genuinely challenged us every week, and it made you want to really pay attention to everything he said each discussion. Professor Fuente is also just a really interesting person with some pretty incredible life experiences he shared with us. The two hour seminar period somehow always felt too short!One thing I will say is that if you are simply looking for the easiest freshman seminar option, this class is probably not for you. Readings in this class were long, with full books being assigned for the week's homework sometimes. In addition to that, there was a short essay due reflecting on those readings each week. However, none of those readings ever felt useless. Each class discussion made it very clear WHY we had read a given text or series of texts, and I believe that attempting to cut some of those out would have sacrificed valuable material from the course. Furthermore, the course is structured chronologically, so you really understand the connection between the various texts throughout the semester. Lastly, I cannot express enough what a wonderful experience this class is, and I think that ought to make the greater–than–average freshman seminar workload worth it. It truly is just a great course with a great professor teaching it, and what you take away from Race Science is so worth a couple of reading cram sessions throughout the semester, especially if the rest of your schedule isn't too rough. Please don't avoid this course because of workload if you think you'll be interested in the content. I literally have nothing but good things to say about it. TLDR: Race Science was one of the best parts of my freshman fall, and I am so grateful to have gotten the chance to be Professor Fuente's student. If you are interested at all by the subject matter take the class. It's a great opportunity to have challenging, in–depth discussions in a small–group setting with other students who are similarly passionate about the course content (I loved my classmates in this course!!!!). I'd absolutely recommend giving this course a try, and I'm so happy to have taken it.",0.9994,,0.0,,0.0,222107,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,First Year Seminar Program,First Year Seminar,,None,,Seminar,Race Science: A History

It covers a ton of content and is super insightful. The most difficult part is the readings. If you want to get the most out of this class you need to do the readings and prepare for discussions, and that is time–consuming. Most of the readings are alright, but some of them are very long or dense. Once you do the readings, though, the rest of the class is pretty easy. The discussions are largely student–led and you will learn a ton from your peers.  There are very few assignments; outside of one assignment at the beginning of the semester, the midterm, and the final, it is just discussion boards. You only need to do 8 discussion boards for the class (though you may find yourself voluntarily doing more) and they are short, informal, and open–ended, so there is very little pressure associated with them. Professor Light is incredibly intelligent and sweet, and she also brings food for students every week!

Everything you learn from this class can be applied in your life.

Good for you.

Have fun with the writing assignments and follow the instructions and you will most likely do well. This course has a couple things that really affect your grade: labors (little comprehension quizzes), creative assignments, the midterm essay, the final essay, and section attendance. I think basically all the TFs don't really care if you attend lecture but I did hear about one TF who did roll call with their section during lecture but that was only one I'm fairly sure. Attend section! It's kinda fun but they do have section makeup assignments if you miss a couple. The labors are kind of annoying but you don't have to do very well on them (I usually got 3/5 questions correct), since they're each like 3% of your grade. Make sure to have fun with the creative assignments! The ones where I put my creativity in it I definitely felt happier with than weeks where I just mashed something together, but generally I got about the same score, but do submit them on time because the late day penalty does add up and it's more worth it to submit a worse assignment than a late one. The midterm essay was kind of fun and pretty chill! The final essay was somewhat strangely structured imo but the 75 minutes was enough time for me and you have most of the assignment details before so you can review material before writing. Overall it was a pretty decent class and not too stressful, the TFs are very nice about answering questions (I had Arin and she was great !!),  I didn't find the lectures helpful whatsoever, but the class overall was a decent break from my other coursework since I like Ancient Greek literature but if you don't like it I would be cautious.",0.9939,"Lectures are extremely boring, and I guarantee not one person was paying attention. Take this course if you want to waste one of your class slots and basically do other classwork during lecture, The professor is a sweetheart, but the overall format of this course is terrible. Erin is easy to reach and the head TFs are pretty generous when it comes to extensions.  You can get away without doing the readings, just know a brief summary of the key points for the ""labors"". The ""creative"" writing assignments revolve around death, or envisioning yourself dying in 10+ years from now. One of the assignments was a drawing of that. Grading is a lot harsher than it should be, especially for a class on greek mythology, also heavily dependent on your TF. Joao is known as the harshest grader and you're expected to have read the readings and the handouts he emails us, whether it be an hour or a week before section. He also cold calls during section. Used to be a gem, but seems to be getting harder as the years pass, also given that this class will most likely get a different professor in the future. You'll get at least an A– if you put the slightest amount of effort in the assignments, but much more difficult to get an A. There are a lot better Geneds for the aesthetics and culture requirement, and I fully regret taking this course. Do not recommend.",-0.9233,"This is of course a GEM, but also a really fun class too. The weekly assignments are creative and enjoyable,  the readings are not necessary,  and even the midterm/final are presented in a way that makes them not overly boring or honed in on the specifics of Greek texts.

Also, you are forced to write in your journal for like 5–10 minutes every class in silence then discuss what you wrote with your peers, and if you don't do what they ask when they ask, there will be a TF literally standing over you to make sure you're either actively writing or talking to your neighbor.

Making students write a 500–word response to make up an EXCUSED absence is insane. Throughout the semester, it really seemed as if the staff was working against students. Much of the teaching staff appeared unsupportive, strict, and quite frankly, pretentious. The grading was also very harsh. It felt as if the course was made to be strict and difficult just for the sake of being strict and difficult!!!For a course that takes itself so seriously, it's not even good.  While some readings were interesting, the lectures were incredibly dull and the class discussions felt very forced and unproductive. Our readings would be about serious topics regarding patient health and terminal illnesses, and then we would just talk about...similes and metaphors in class?This is also one of those classes where everyone in section is quiet...even the TF.

The class, all in all, is not too demanding because attendance is not mandatory, exams are take–home, there are no reading checks and it's easy to participate in sections even if you haven't really done the reading. But if you don't go to lecture it's really hard to keep up with the content – I say if you don't have any time, just don't do the readings but definitely go to the lecture or have someone who can tell you about it because the exams are hard and the classes are not recorded/slides aren't shared, and depending on your TF, it's not the easiest to get a good grade. The sections were really great, Prof Sunstein has an amazing team of law school students etc. who help him with the course! He himself is also incredibly engaging, smart, and funny.

You think that your frivolous, insouciant attitude is enough to cut it. HAHAHA NO. That's your optimism bias speaking, the planning fallacy in action!  Are you prepared to combat the Perversity Thesis while fending off sludge from every corner? Have you even stopped to consider that maybe you're the Bootlegger, not the Baptist? Change isn't some docile stream you can bend and dam up at will. It's a gushing waterfall, and right now, you are a mere tree branch getting swept up in all that change.But don't fall victim to Paralyzing Pessimism! Change is fickle thing, but if there's one thing Professor Sunstein has taught me, it's that the FedSoc did it and so can you. Take this class so you can learn about the secrets of policymaking and behavioral science. Personally, taking this class gave me superpowers—the superpower to make change, to be exact. I haven't got a full handle on these powers yet, but I let's just say I was able to make change on my GPA after that Making Change final! Talk about it! Get out there and make change, everyone.

Reading is unnecessary, and the exams will not test it—can be helpful to skim once and a while to lock in on a concept, participate in an optional discussion post that boosts your participation score, etc.  There are no recordings of the lectures, so you need to attend class to succeed.

I loved having guest lectures from different culinary backgrounds and expertise, ranging from chefs from the Galapagos, Michelin star chefs, or owners of local bakeries/restaurants in Cambridge (not to mention the free food we would get every class!!). Lectures were engaging and interesting and the class demos always left me discussing with friends outside of class. However, this class is not the easiest. Though we cook for every lab, this is not a cooking class and definitely is very rooted in chemistry. With minimal previous chemistry knowledge, I was often left confused on concepts as they weren't covered that in depth in class but would make up most of the PSETs. I went to office hours every week and still struggled on the PSETs and did not do well on the exams.

Also, if your group is small, and half your group is absent, it makes it hard to tell the story.

Never a dull moment there.Take the class if you like superheroes (if you don't know anything about them, you'll be totally fine), and if you will be fine with the readings.

I don't feel like I learned anything.

The class is advertised as a gem, which is only partially true. There is not a lot of work in the class, but the grading is not particularly generous, so you're definitely not guaranteed an A. Occasionally Professor Burt gave interesting lectures (she is a brilliant, hilarious, well–spoken, and entertaining person). Much of the class, however, involved a role–playing game whereby you pretend to be a superhero and tell a story about adventures your superhero goes on with other people in the class. This may sound appealing, but it is not. It is awkward, tedious, not fun, and incredibly uneducational. There are so many aesthetics and culture geneds at Harvard that can provide you an interesting foray into that world. I suggest you pick one other than this.",0.973,,,,,,,,,

Many of the cases played it too safe where there was really only one stance to take because the other one is literally just something that would get you cancelled. Thus many of the points in discussion in class were very repetitive and just everyone agreeing with each other with possibly some additional points from their personal life (which was the part that was definitely nice to listen to). However, I did really enjoy section a lot as it was a very comfortable space to share personal experiences and give more opinionated thoughts – which I guess is what I thought would happen in the class overall but I also realize that it is not as comforting to do the same in such a huge class. Overall though, it is a good Gened to take as it opens your eyes to a lot of things that you may never have talked about with your family or friends like ever so that was really insightful – and the midterm and final are essays that are manageable as long as you space them out well and don't procrastinate – good class to add to your schedule if your schedule is packed with pset classes as my schedule was – just make sure to start essays EARLY!! Ask a TF if you have concerns about your essay topic and get any help throughout the process – it will make your life so much easier.",0.9951,"I learned more about different religions in the American context and the conversations were really enlightening.  I think the Ethics and Civics requirement is notorious for not having good options, and I think this one is a pretty decent option if taken pass/fail.

The course content was mildly interesting and Professor Eck is very very nice. There is very little work (just a discussion post and reading) on a weekly basis, but the midterm paper and very long final paper take a while. Taking a class on religion this semester, during the Israel–Palestine conflict, was a bit uncomfortable, especially because no one was willing to talk about it but everyone had an opinion about it. That said, I did learn a lot. The lectures were super boring. Finally, the grading in the class is wildly inconsistent across sections, and sadly, I had a more difficult TF, but I had many friends who had easier TFs.

I did not know it was possible to facilitate a discussion among a ~200 person class, but Sandel did it masterfully as if it was nothing. Lecture was very interesting, and he would regularly invite the authors of our readings to come in and speak (including such speakers as the current chief justice of the Indian supreme court, just to give you a sense). By the middle of the course, it felt that readings were a little redundant to lecture (ie the authors would just come in and rehash everything the reading covered), which I found a little unfortunate as it would have been nice to dive deeper into the material, but lectures were still engaging and interesting. I think the intention was for student discussion and engagement with the guests to be what drove the conversation deeper than the readings, which is fair. Some may find this a plus, others a minus, but nonetheless the course was very interesting.In this class, it is very easy to participate in lectures, but hardly necessary. Section was great, very interesting discussions. I will say, in our section students sometimes got too caught up in practical considerations and distracted from the actual political philosophy, despite the TFs best efforts to steer them back towards philosophical thought, which was okay but a bit frustrating. But our TF ran section wonderfully and was very passionate about the material, engaged with us, etc. Essays were interesting topics, and the TF offered very helpful and thoughtful feedback on our first essay. The oral exam was not my favorite idea, but it was not too bad (or at least I don't think it was!)Of all the aspects of the course, the one that was the biggest highlight was Prof Sandel's office hours. These were basically another section, but just run by Sandel. Conversation was always incredibly interesting, and really the most meaningful part of the course to me. Whether you agree or disagree with Prof. Sandel right now, especially if you do disagree with him, you should take this course. The questions that it asks are incredibly interesting, and the conversations that it forces are incredibly enlightening. I have honestly found that the more I've taken the course, the more I've been convinced, and this course has really forced me to look at society in a different way. I think it has just encouraged me to take less for granted, and be more thoughtful in thinking about society. All in all, I would highly recommend this course!",0.9986,Grading on essays is brutal,-0.6249,"If you are interested in the idea of meritocracy, definitely take this course! It is the perfect class to explore such an interesting topic– the assignments are primarily readings and the lectures are super interesting. Michael Sandel is the best of the best, and I believe everyone should take at least one class with him.  I felt like I learned so much in this class, and it was such a low time commitment, while still being engaging and fun. The only negative, in my opinion, is that it starts to get a bit repetitive. However, every class is always interesting– Professor Sandel brings in a lot of amazing guest speakers, and you can tell he really cares about this topic and his students!

I had never taken an art history course, but honestly it was really fun for me to just come to class and hear her present on her material. She is an excellent lecturer, she keeps you engaged live with interesting class discussions (that somehow doesn't seem cheesy and stupid), and she weaves together interesting stories, arguments, and themes in her presentations. She CLEARLY puts a lot of time, effort, and thought into TEACHING which is very refreshing to experience from faculty at Harvard, who more often seem to care much more about their research and less about students. Ultimately, Professor Maranci is incredibly kind and compassionate and just wants you to learn about Armenia, a place and culture and aesthetic tradition she has a lot of love for. If you just show up with a curious and excited mind, you will have a lot of fun, and she will also meet you right there –– that's pretty much all you need to do. That being said, if you think you *Can't Stand* staring at images of art and architecture for an hour and fifteen minutes twice a week, don't take this class, because despite professor Maranci being wonderful and engaging, this class is structured around presentations filled with images of Armenian art and architecture, largely religious in nature (like images of Jesus and churches).Sections weren't great, but hopefully they will be restructured as this was the first year teaching this course.",0.9974,,0.0,"This is a great class to get an introduction to Armenian culture, art, architecture, and history.

Professor Peterson may seem intimidating but he's a nice dude, and although you might not get to know him personally without going to office hours, or running into him before class he is always a joy regardless. He keeps his politics and opinions out of class, and takes a view of American Government in well, 'a new perspective' like the name of the class. But to get to the point, this class is great if you are: starting your government concentration, unsure on majoring in government, want to take a class that is very entry level to government, and also looking for a class to fill your schedule that doesn't take too much time! There is a one prompt short answer 5 min question at the start of every class, but they are also relatively the course material from the videos so don't worry too much, and it is easy to catch up if you get sick and miss a class.The readings are very inaccessible due to costs, so I recommend finding a way to get them through library reserves or speaking to the Professor or TF, I got one of my books from requesting it from an inter–library loan which is another option. I try not to spend money on books so that is my advice!Summary:– Professor Peterson is a icon, he is funny, well–versed, and knows what he is talking about– Books are expensive, but can be accessed online, through TF's or via library.– Easy if you already took classes like AP Gov, might need extra studying if you don't know anything about American Government– Midterms and Finals were relatively explanatory– Quiz every class lecture, but just the course material– HIGHLY RECOMMENDED COURSE– Also STAN Chris S. Liu!!!!! (dude in the videos!)",0.9923,THIS CLASS IS A HIDDEN GEM IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE OR IN DEPT ABOUT AMERICAN GOVERNMENT.

I was a little worried about taking this class my freshman fall, but it was well taught with so many resources for support outside of class. Blackwell is a great lecturer who does a good job combining coding skills and statistical concepts in his lectures. I will say that having an understanding of some basic statistical concepts may make the class a bit easier to understand. However, it's definitely not necessary.  Similarly, I don't think that you need any knowledge of R to take this class. I came in having never coded in R, and the class definitely takes the time to teach the basics, especially in the first half of the semester. Beyond the class, I genuinely just think there are so many resources to support you with p–sets, projects, and exams that even if you have trouble with the lectures, you should still be alright in the course. Section, office hours, study halls,  and Ed and Slack discussions are all excellent resources. Don't hesitate to go to office hours as much as you need! I went to office hours almost every week to get p–set help, and I'm so glad I did. P–sets were no problem at all for me, and it was because of the incredible help the TFs and CAs provided myself and other students with. The main TFs I went to for help were Ahmet and Pranav, and they were absolutely incredible for the entire semester. Both were excellent section leaders and were very available outside of that. They reliably answered any questions I had about p–sets and my final project. All in all, this class is run very well, and I genuinely believe Blackwell and the course staff want the students to succeed. They certainly did everything they could to make sure we did this semester!",0.9966,"Gov 50 is no longer the horror gov elective that it was once thought to be.

I never felt like it was wasting my time or like it was busy work. Every single thing (except for section) in the course and on the website served a purpose and it did so very well. I can also not say enough nice things about Matt Blackwell. He is a Harvard GEM and we need to protect him at all costs. He cares SO much and it shows so deeply and I am so glad I had him as a professor.

I think if you have any interest in authoritarian leaders or governments, it's definitely worth trying this class. While the readings can be a bit theoretical, you can definitely see the connection of theory to real–world leaders or history. I was personally pretty excited to see theories from class in real–world politics, something the course highlights nicely with an assignment that asks students to submit news articles/videos/etc about world leaders or events that reflect class themes. I also appreciated the case study aspect of the course where you get to examine a particular authoritarian leader over the course of the semester. I'd recommend avoiding obscure leaders since the assignments related to the case study are very research heavy and often call for quantitative data. Choosing a more obscure leader will make completing these assignments significantly more difficult/time–consuming. Professor Hummel is a great professor. Her lectures are extremely effective, and I'd always prioritize lectures over readings (though I truly recommend doing both! It will make the midterm much easier). She also was available outside of class, and I was able to meet with her for office hours multiple times with very little trouble. Section is good, though it certainly was obvious that many students did not do the readings. However, I think my section leader did a good job of keeping conversation flowing. I'd sincerely recommend meeting with your section leader about each major assignment in the course. As long as I met the expectations I discussed with my section leader during office hours, she was very understanding about grading on all of my essays. Regarding grading, I think the essays were graded fairly. The midterm is open–note, and while there's a tight timeframe given the expectations of the midterm, it's definitely doable with organized notes and a good baseline understanding of the material. I think this course in on the easier side, and it was definitely a good introduction to the Government department in my experience.",0.9958,"Just do the readings and you'll be fine!

The data exercises help you learn a lot about both the content and data science in general, plus it's cool to get your hands on the data that you've just learned about in lecture.

For my final project, I got to create and conduct my own social science survey with hundreds of actual respondents, which I thought was really cool.

I recommend this class, but only for those with a desire to do more math in the context of social sciences!",0.9894,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

The 24 hour exam took me 19 straight hours to do. But it's also very rewarding and a very well–resourced course for a class of its size. Kosuke and the teaching staff are all great and patient.I took it as a undergrad with STAT 110 and STAT 111 previously and 139 concurrently (as well as lots of R experience) and was fine for the GOV side of the course, though experience with more advanced regression implementation would certainly be useful. The distinction between the GOV and STAT side can sometimes be blurry, but in general the GOV side is more focused on empirical implementation while STAT focuses on analytical derivations.286/2003 covers a lot of ground. Regardless whether you're STAT or GOV, the course tries to teach both the theoretical underpinnings of various inference methods while teaching you how to implement them, which... is a lot! But it's generally pretty successful in this endeavour.I'd recommend doing all the PSETs and be sure to note that the second half of the course gets much more difficult and has far more content.Also just an aside but the STAT TF Kyla Chasalow is easily the best TF I've ever had. She made the material so clear in her section, even when it could get a bit muddled in lecture. Also she wrote a 130–page note document for the class, effectively serving as a course textbook.",0.9962,"This course is very challenging and you have to invest a lot of time.

This is probably the best history class I've taken so far (as a junior in the concentration) and I don't say that lightly. I learned so much from the readings –– which are all awesome and very intentionally chosen so definitely spend some time doing them...or at the very least doing part of them since they are like 200 pages a week –– and the discussion is very centered on discussing the readings in depth so it helps you really understand them. There were weeks when I wasn't able to do the reading and it was fine, as Prof. Bekemeyer is so so nice and really just wants to help you (so if no one knew an answer he would help by asking more leading questions lol like he wouldn't leave you out to dry with the discussion). The assignments are a typical scaffolded history assignment structure where you lead up to a final paper on a specific topic you choose based on primary source material – pretty standard here. Prof. Bekemeyer and Sanjay are great – it's the perfect mix of seriousness –– decent amount of reading, discussion cannot be bs'd and the assignments also are taken decently seriously (although I wouldn't say are graded super hard, pretty reasonable). It's a great course for a history concentrator (like me) but it is also a good class for someone who is scared to take their first history seminar/might not have as much of a history background. It's pretty intense on the amount of reading and the final assignment is a 15 page paper creating an original argument based on primary sources (aka you can't just summarize what has been said about your topic before) which can be a bit tough if you haven't written a paper like that before, but if you are willing to push yourself I'd definitely recommend. Prof. Bekemeyer and Sanjay are so supportive and I highly recommend going to their office hours. Overall one of my favorite courses here and I'd recommend it to anyone at all interested (with the caveat that you need to put a good amount of effort/time in lol).",0.9967,"Take this course only if you have preliminary knowledge on capitalism, crime, and punishment.

Solid history class, but I want to make a huge caveat: You’ll only get one, biased viewpoint on the history of Black lawmaking in this class. The instructor has very left–leaning ideals, and so do the students. The only lawyers that were given case studies were far left–leaning. They were upheld as martyrs. There was no political diversity in this course, which made for a very boring and intellectually dull experience. There was no room for debate. Not all Black lawyers are liberal. I would’ve loved to learn more about conservative Black lawyers and their impacts. Liberals don’t have all the answers. Students self–select into this class, so beware of the class discussions. They’re very left–leaning and left no room for critiques of leftist/liberal ideals. I mentioned representation of conservative Black lawyers in class once and I got shunned. This class has no room for academic freedom. Discussions were long and monotonous and repetitive. It’s the same 11 “future lawyers/activists” and IOP kids spewing their half–baked thoughts on inequality and Black rights—when 80% of the class wasn’t even Black. One day we wasted 45 minutes discussing what pronouns we should use for Pauli Murray. I believe in gender representation/rights, but minuscule details like that are not important for understanding the depth of her impact. No one paid attention in class discussions. Maybe one or two students. Everyone else just did work on their laptops. Given the self–selection into this class, be prepared to meet and be irritated by the obnoxious social justice warriors. One student would never fail to remind us that she’s doing research at Radcliffe and has swipe access to all the buildings. That’s just the nature of people who’d be interested in this class—obnoxious people who think they know the answer to everything. In–class discussions and discussion posts were absolutely useless. Other than that, it’s a solid history course. It’s unique in that you get full access to Schlesinger library. Something that you should take advantage of during your time here — especially if you’re a woman. I enjoyed the research process. Professor Eatmon is a solid professor and accessible with writing/research assistance. She’s not the most organized though. She changed the final assignment halfway into the course, which was incredibly frustrating and unprofessional. We were originally given the option to record a podcast, which attracted a lot of people to the course—including myself. After the add/drop deadline. she changed the final assignment to only having the option of writing a 3,000 word paper….Baiting people into a class with a fun final project—just to change it at the last minute—is not cool. I didn’t appreciate that at all, and future students should beware of this behavior. The archival activities were interesting and unique. Outside of that, I wouldn’t recommend this course.

Some students might find these simple assignments and lack of secondary source reading as gem–like, but I just found the assignments annoying to do. Even more frustrating, they were graded in a very nit–picky, surprisingly harsh way. I didn't find any assignment gratifying, and the grading was very uncharitable, especially given how vague/simple all the assignments were.  These assignments also didn't really build any of my skills as a history student. The final paper involved three ridiculously vague prompts and only 3 pages to discuss 500 years of European history. No secondary source reading allowed, only lecture notes, and it was so odd and vague.

This is not to say that the discussions on culture were absent––they were simply not the main focus of the class. As such, this can be a great class if you are interested in History and Science or STS. However, if you are more interested in learning about the politics of representation and/or media studies in general, I would consider other courses. Something to keep in mind is that most course materials were (dry) academic papers and essays, with very few primary sources to engage with.

You encounter a ton of cool art from the last 40 years in class, and some of the pieces I saw in lecture will stick with me for the rest of my life. The workload is never unmanageable, and you can re–do pretty much every assignment with feedback from the TFs, who are great, if you want. This course has the content of an intro class, but Professor Lambert–Beatty does not have the attitude of someone teaching an intro class. As pretty much everybody knows, there's a big debate about what ""art"" actually is, and it's pretty much impossible to start from zero knowledge about post–modern art and contemporary art without hitting the wall of, ""does this still count?"" But Professor Lambert–Beatty, maybe because she's been in the art world for so long, and maybe because she's simply sick of the central debate of any person encountering art academically for the first time, sort of refuses to engage with this question. Genuine curiosity from students is met with defensiveness and accusations of thinking the course material is unserious. Sometimes Professor Lambert–Beatty would even acknowledge that some people in the class might be skeptical of certain types of art, but every time somebody took the bait and expressed that opinion, it would turn into a  one–sided debate between a professor and somebody who had only just learned what ""contemporary"" means a few weeks prior. I'm only expressing this so long–windedly because I hope that in the next iteration of this class, there's a bit more of an assumption of good–faith curiosity rather than an expectation of cynicism. As a humanities student who took this class as a pure elective, my heart sinks when I think of people taking this class for the humanities distribution requirement thinking that this is how we all are. I really do understand the impulse to protect something you love as much as Professor Lambert–Beatty clearly loves art. But I fear that she's just protecting the art from genuine interest. One more thing—as you learn pretty quickly in this class, contemporary art is mostly about and/or related to social justice issues. Professor Lambert–Beatty often comes across as a bit uncomfortable discussing these topics in front of a lecture. Again, this seems to come from a desire to get it right more than anything else, which you have to respect. But it's a bit awkward to sit through the anxious throat–clearing before we can get to the heart of these discussions. Whenever it was something related to my identity being discussed, I felt sort of othered a lot of the time because of her anxiety discussing things that are normal to me. In my opinion, this isn't a reason not to take this class. But something to note. tl;dr take this class but don't raise your hand in lecture unless you want to be argued with",0.9879,"Professor is awful (like really awful at teaching/engaging, i don't believe anyone takes her seriously) but the class is somewhat made up by content, little workload and lack of exams.",-0.6762,,0.0,207735,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,History of Art & Architecture,History of Art & Architecture,,Arts and Humanities,,Lecture,Introduction to Contemporary Art

Dr. Alex is amazing and working with her and learning from her is the one of the best parts of the course. She is very approachable, supportive, and helpful, and works with you on your project. It is a class that make you think about different forms of science communication through lecture discussions and weekly assignments. You choose a project that you will work on throughout the semester and work on that project, and meanwhile learn all these different types of scientific writing. Great course, and I absolutely loved it.",0.9882,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

The format of the class is a bit unique, as there is no lecture component and is entirely student discussion led (although this means the quality of each class is dependent on a student discussion leader) Two hours of discussion can feel like a lot, so I would say to only take the course if you're really interested in the material and prepared to do the (manageable) readings. There is a great community around the class, and you can tell everyone is very interested in the topic. I was initially worried that the topic might get redundant week to week, but every class was super interesting and offered a look into different aspects of our relationships with animals.  While the weekly work load is relatively low, writing the two papers and planning your week's discussion are pretty involved, and I would say the professor is a bit of a tough grader. I think my only real issue with this class is that the professor does not put grades into Canvas, so it's on students to calculate their own average and keep track of their grades (so hold onto your printed and graded discussion posts!) Overall, this is a really great class, and I think that everyone can take away something valuable from it!",0.9859,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

The lab section is normal bio lab for the first half of the term and then turns into all coding for the second half of the term. You do not need to know how to code to join this class, but I found it very overwhelming and frustrating at times because almost everyone else did know so it wasn't always taught in a super beginner friendly way.  That said, Claire (TF) was super helpful and made the code–learning process so much more manageable and eventually enjoyable (to a degree). I think the class overall is very interesting and worth taking. I think I learned a lot, especially during the final paper. I would just be hesitant if you have never coded or if you aren't super comfortable with dense scientific papers, because the HW is always to read challenging scientific papers and then class is mostly discussing them.",0.9832,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

Professor Bobaljik is really engaging and obviously cares about the material. It is really fun to participate in class as well, and I say that as someone who usually gets very anxious and uncomfortable participating. If you are nervous about the required participation, Professor Bobaljik makes it less scary. He gives positive feedback on your answer even if it's not quite right, and encourages participation for things like examples of English words that have some characteristic, which may feel easier to answer than a question about linguistic theory.I didn't really make friends in this class, but I recommend you do for checking psets over. Even though the psets are easy, some small things are sometimes tricky, like confusing instructions or conflicting approaches. I really loved this class though. It was the highlight of my semester. Lecture was exciting and the readings were interesting. There was never any busywork either– all assignments had a clear purpose and all readings had important information in every paragraph. The process project is extremely fun, so have a blast with it.I didn't give this class all the effort I wish I could have, because of other hard classes and a personally difficult semester, but I still got a lot out of it. In some ways, having this class during such a hard semester in my personal life was amazing because it felt entirely like fun, even though it was something technically productive to work on. It's also a really nice reminder about how cool humans are in general. Language is neat because people are neat. I think if you like linguistics as much as I do, which I am guessing you do if you are a concentrator or taking a secondary in it, this class is the bee's knees. Professor Bobaljik is a really good professor. I recommend taking advantage of office hours to get the most out of the class. If you are confused about topics or particular examples, he will spend a lot of time explaining it and even follow up with more information. Honestly, this class nearly convinced me to become a linguistics concentrator. 10/10 experience.",0.9981,,0.0,,0.0,125790,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Linguistics,Linguistics,,Arts and Humanities,,Lecture,Word Structure

Aside from the 12 hours per week you spend outside of class on problem sets, you must review content in order to pass exams and gain a full understanding of the material. This class involves attending section 3 days a week, math workshop 1 day a week, and (optional but highly recommended) math coaching 1 day a week and an algebra study group 1 day a week. If you do not have a solid foundation in Algebra and Pre–Calculus, I recommend brushing up on those skills before enrolling. I was unable to complete problem sets without going to office hours and the Math Questions Center nearly everyday. I spent most of my time devoted to Math Ma in comparison to my other 3 classes so I would avoid taking this class alongside other STEM or problem set classes. Although I found this class to be very challenging, the teaching staff and course assistants are the best. My teaching fellow, Matt Demers, was very kind and approachable. He explained concepts clearly during section and was always available to meet one–on–one outside of section to review difficult concepts. The course assistants care that students have a full understanding of material and answer questions thoroughly.

The first few PSETs are scary, but don't let that deter you! The exams will be the same concepts tested in the simplest way and it is easy to do well. Overall, trust yourself! If you start studying for exams at least 3 days prior, pay attention in section, and do the PSETs to actually understand the math, then this class will be easy. I know people are gonna drag this course, but it truly was not bad. The main issue was just that the practice exams were way harder than the actual exams making it hard to get a good idea of what the exams would be like, but this is easily fixable.",0.99,"This class will be difficult especially if you have never taken calculus in high school.

Having a solid background in calculus (AP Calc AB is enough imo, but do the first diagnostic pset to figure out your own comfort level) is helpful, along with a high–school level background with biology/chemistry. You'll likely want a basic working knowledge of concepts like rate law, cell cycles, action potentials, etc. You can definitely take this course as a substitute to Math 21A, and possibly 1B. Upsides: 1 problem set a week (5–8 questions, reasonable difficulty and TFs are very helpful), Wes is an amazing lecturer and I highly recommend going to his office hours. Final project instead of a final exam, and the two midterms are honestly fine — and very similar in difficulty/content to the practice midterms. Being a small class, it's really easy to get close with and make friends with your coursemates — make a group to check psets with/study with, and you'll do great. Grading on the psets and exams are fair and Wes really does try to give as many partial points as possible when grading the midterms. Downsides: the course material does speed up in pace somewhat significantly after the first midterm. There are weekly readings (papers) that you should really try to keep on top of,  because otherwise studying for midterms will be a pain (reading–based questions on the midterms make up ~15% of the exam grade). Wes does offer a good amount of meetings/consultations/advice for the final project, but you really need to pick a good initial paper to have a good project — and get started on modelling/simulating in Mathematica well before reading period so you can debug and fix your modifications without getting overwhelmed.",0.9955,,0.0,,0.0,110596,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Mathematics,Mathematics,Yes,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Modeling and Differential Equations for the Life Sciences

Since the class is taught in small sections, you build a really good bond with your table, the TF, and the course assistants, and the class environment is very supportive. They really emphasize working through hard problems (and there will be many of them!), which makes the process of learning very rewarding and solidifies your understanding well. I absolutely loved the teaching method of this class and I could not recommend that more. My only reservations with this class are that you should not underestimate the workload of 3 psets/week (the psets are not very short and you will need to check answers or go to MQC for help) and that you have to be prepared to spend time really solidifying these concepts outside of class or before exams. However, if you need to take this class or want to go further in math than Calc I/II, I really really enjoyed this course and would recommend. (P.S. Fanhui is an awesome TF!)",0.9884,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! I don't care what anyone says––take anything else. Taking this course has made me realize how manageable and fair of a course Math 1B was. I did well in Math 1B and found this course to be unreasonably difficult. The exams were incredibly unfair –– no amount of studying or practice was ever enough to prepare me for what I was being tested on. It seriously felt as if I was taking an IQ test every time I took an exam.We also met FOUR TIMES a week because we were forced to attend an additional *useless* workshop that no one wanted to be in. Also, for a class that has 3 PSets a week, the PSets were very long and we had practically no extra credit opportunities.

If you can avoid taking the class, please do. I regret the decision all the time — I could have taken a math I'd already done and enjoyed my life, but I thought I'd challenge myself. I guess I thought that with enough hours studying or doing PSETs at MQC, I'd be able to master the content and do well on the exams. But no matter what I did (practice problems, watch videos, read the textbook, organize study groups, make study guides, etc.) the tests were just so much harder than what the average student in the class would know. When I would do PSETs, I felt confident about the material and also studied an insane amount leading up to every test. Regardless, they went mid. I think the final went better, but who knows? It's an unfortunate situation, especially because I'm pre med so grades matter. So if you're pre med and do not need this class for your concentration, PLEASE take anything else. Something that I realized pretty late was that a lot of people in my section had already taken multivariable calculus to some extent, and so they were able to connect the dots faster than the average student. I wish I had done that with BC, because the mental and emotional toll this class took on me was intense. Of course, challenge yourself and I'm sure you can do anything you put your mind to, but at some point you have to ask yourself: is it worth it? Is your mental heath and happiness worth it? Because that's what I sacrificed this semester and, for me, it was not worth it.

Many students have already had exposure to this material which makes the understanding of the concepts in section be much faster and moving through the material at a very fast pace that leaves people who are new to the material left begins in the understanding. Also, this semester's teaching team did not provide enough support for student who are struggling with the material in the exception of 2 TF's who are dedicated to the students success, (Fanhui & Roderic)  besides that I had very limited contact t and understanding of the concepts with the rest of the team. Office hours and MQC are essential for the understanding of this class and the only way to succeed in the course. I constantly felled behind the course even if I went to MQC, office hours and began the pset the day it was assigned. I constantly put priority in beginning the pset and asking questions in MQC/Office hours in order to grasp the concepts and study outside of class but even with the constant work the exams were extreemely hartd and time consuming which allowed for a lot of room to make mistakes and lower my overall grade in the course. The exams make up a big portion of the grade so this misunderstandings and feeling isolated in the class with your learning and understanding can lead to a low grade and be in the cusp of wither passing the class or having to retake it. Thius class is definately not the best at its teaching sue to the fast–paced that is lead by students who have seen the concepts before and students who this is the first time in seeing the material are elft behind and the gap in knowledge bvegins to build.

I will tell you from experience, this is not an easy course, but it is doable: You just need to put in the work. First, I will talk about the course structure (assignments, exams, etc.) and then I will tell you my personal experience about the class.Lecture – Math 21a is organized into small class sections rather than a big lecture hall like the other STEM classes. You'll have a class of ~20 –25 students. Each class, you'll have to bring your workbook to complete the questions regarding the course concepts. But here's the catch: You actually have to write out WORDS in math. Yes, words... The worksheets are structured so that you won't be able to finish them all on time, but there are few occasions where you will finish. Don't worry though, the solutions to the worksheets are posted on Canvas the same day later in the evening.Problem Sets (psets) – Like Math 1a and 1b, 21a has three psets a week, one due Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Now, your first instinct would be to take Pset 0 and head to the library to figure it out on your own. That is fine, but, if you're spending 1–2 hours on one question, you are wasting time. My strongest advice is if there are office hours (OH) after class, go to them as soon as you finish class so that the material stays fresh in your mind. The TFs are helpful as they can provide clarification on questions you feel lost on. OH are held on Mondays through Fridays. The other resource that is super helpful is Math Question Center (MQC), which runs from Sundays through Thursdays in the evenings. They are held by course assistants (CAs) who have taken the Math 21a already and can help you knock your pset. My warning is that Sunday nights are usually the most chaotic since so many people are trying to submit their pset before Monday morning; so try to arrive as early as it starts so the CAs give you as much attention as possible. Workshops – The section is honestly not too helpful at times. They are headed by CAs and you are required to attend these sections every Tuesdays, except the Tuesday(s) during the week of your math midterm, and they're meant to show you how multivariable calculus is applied in the real world. While they were interesting at times, I felt like they could have been used more for reviewing topics that build on one another (similar to how discussion sections in science classes are meant to review content). Other than that, you'll have to complete your workshop activities diligently as few of the questions in certain workshops are in your problem sets.Mini–Exam + Revisit – The mini–exam only covered the first 5 topics. It is meant to give you a taste of what a math 21a exam looks like. The good news is that you can retake it for a higher score. The bad news is (1) that if you want to retake it , you would have to take it the same day as midterm 1 (the revisit takes place after the midterm) and (2) it only accounts for 5% of your grade. Then again, every point matters in your grade, so it is up to you.Midterms + FinalYou'll be provided with practice exams with answers and solutions for each test. My biggest advice for this is to do them as early as possible and truly reflect from them. Just as a disclaimer, just because there is a question on the practice test, this doesn't mean it will be on the actual test. The practice exams are to help you identify concepts that you need more clarification on. So make sure that after you finish them, make a tally of all the questions you got wrong, write down which concepts are being tested by them by looking at the solutions, and then bring your questions or concerns to MQC/Office hours. From my experience, I remember that the second midterm surprised us because the wording of a few of the questions was so weird. But regardless, you need to (1) figure out what they want you to solve, (2) discern the possible concepts need, and (3) execute your solution.For my background, I had taken multivariable calculus in high school when I was a senior. However, we did not go as in depth into the topics 21a covers (partly because the class in high school was brand new, so it was a pilot course). Regardless, I still struggled in 21a during the first couple of classes because we needed to think in terms of R3 (the third dimension) and reason with derivatives and integrals in R3. The psets were a pain at the beginning since I made the rookie mistake of trying to figure them out on my own instead of seeking out for help. Luckily, in the second half of the semester, I went to OH regularly after class to knock out a good chunk of pset questions and then went to MQC to verify my answers.Do not be afraid or embarrassed to ask for help in your 21a class. This is not meant to be an easy class nor are you meant to do it alone. Even though most students will have the same/similar math background as you, some may comprehend the math topics quicker than you, and that is okay. It is not indicative of your capabilities or skill set in math, it just means you have more to learn.

I will tell you from experience, this is not an easy course, but it is doable: You just need to put in the work. First, I will talk about the course structure (assignments, exams, etc.) and then I will tell you my personal experience about the class.Lecture – Math 21a is organized into small class sections rather than a big lecture hall like the other STEM classes. You'll have a class of ~20 –25 students. Each class, you'll have to bring your workbook to complete the questions regarding the course concepts. But here's the catch: You actually have to write out WORDS in math. Yes, words... The worksheets are structured so that you won't be able to finish them all on time, but there are few occasions where you will finish. Don't worry though, the solutions to the worksheets are posted on Canvas the same day later in the evening.Problem Sets (psets) – Like Math 1a and 1b, 21a has three psets a week, one due Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Now, your first instinct would be to take Pset 0 and head to the library to figure it out on your own. That is fine, but, if you're spending 1–2 hours on one question, you are wasting time. My strongest advice is if there are office hours (OH) after class, go to them as soon as you finish class so that the material stays fresh in your mind. The TFs are helpful as they can provide clarification on questions you feel lost on. OH are held on Mondays through Fridays. The other resource that is super helpful is Math Question Center (MQC), which runs from Sundays through Thursdays in the evenings. They are held by course assistants (CAs) who have taken the Math 21a already and can help you knock your pset. My warning is that Sunday nights are usually the most chaotic since so many people are trying to submit their pset before Monday morning; so try to arrive as early as it starts so the CAs give you as much attention as possible. Workshops – The section is honestly not too helpful at times. They are headed by CAs and you are required to attend these sections every Tuesdays, except the Tuesday(s) during the week of your math midterm, and they're meant to show you how multivariable calculus is applied in the real world. While they were interesting at times, I felt like they could have been used more for reviewing topics that build on one another (similar to how discussion sections in science classes are meant to review content). Other than that, you'll have to complete your workshop activities diligently as few of the questions in certain workshops are in your problem sets.Mini–Exam + Revisit – The mini–exam only covered the first 5 topics. It is meant to give you a taste of what a math 21a exam looks like. The good news is that you can retake it for a higher score. The bad news is (1) that if you want to retake it , you would have to take it the same day as midterm 1 (the revisit takes place after the midterm) and (2) it only accounts for 5% of your grade. Then again, every point matters in your grade, so it is up to you.Midterms + FinalYou'll be provided with practice exams with answers and solutions for each test. My biggest advice for this is to do them as early as possible and truly reflect from them. Just as a disclaimer, just because there is a question on the practice test, this doesn't mean it will be on the actual test. The practice exams are to help you identify concepts that you need more clarification on. So make sure that after you finish them, make a tally of all the questions you got wrong, write down which concepts are being tested by them by looking at the solutions, and then bring your questions or concerns to MQC/Office hours. From my experience, I remember that the second midterm surprised us because the wording of a few of the questions was so weird. But regardless, you need to (1) figure out what they want you to solve, (2) discern the possible concepts need, and (3) execute your solution.For my background, I had taken multivariable calculus in high school when I was a senior. However, we did not go as in depth into the topics 21a covers (partly because the class in high school was brand new, so it was a pilot course). Regardless, I still struggled in 21a during the first couple of classes because we needed to think in terms of R3 (the third dimension) and reason with derivatives and integrals in R3. The psets were a pain at the beginning since I made the rookie mistake of trying to figure them out on my own instead of seeking out for help. Luckily, in the second half of the semester, I went to OH regularly after class to knock out a good chunk of pset questions and then went to MQC to verify my answers.Do not be afraid or embarrassed to ask for help in your 21a class. This is not meant to be an easy class nor are you meant to do it alone. Even though most students will have the same/similar math background as you, some may comprehend the math topics quicker than you, and that is okay. It is not indicative of your capabilities or skill set in math, it just means you have more to learn. Definitely, Math 21a helped me grow as a problem–solver at Harvard in terms of recognizing how concepts build on one another, and working collaboratively with others. This class is a journey, and just like any journey, you've got to embrace the process.",0.9964,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

On one hand, yes, the allegations are true: this class is very difficult for two main reasons. 1. It is unfamiliar for most people going in. Despite following the A/B naming convention of the intro math courses here at Harvard, 21A and 21B are nothing alike. In the former, it was pretty clear what you were working with vectors and calculus in 3–D space and all of the implications of that followed from the basics. 21B doesn't feel nearly as connected as 21A does; the best way I can describe it is that 21B is a survey of the different (admittedly pretty cool) things you can do with linear algebra, but it doesn't have the same logical progression of 21A, especially towards the latter half of the class. Some will disagree––I know at least one person who hated 21A and loved 21B, so it may just be personal taste. All I can say for certainty is that, if all you've taken for the last few years is calculus, this is a completely different experience.2. The material is hard. Or rather, a more accurate statement would be that reliably seeing the connections between topics is difficult. I don't think that any one topic in 21B is particularly difficult from a conceptual point of view. But, the questions that are asked on exams require a certain ""creativity"" that requires a level of mastery that's a bit deeper than I think this class set us up for. The class requires you to apply concepts in interesting ways (which is a strength of the class), but it doesn't really teach you how to apply those concepts.Suffice it to say, if you're thinking about adding this as a fourth class to a 30+ hour a week schedule (like I did), don't: you are not him.On the other hand, linear algebra and differential equations are two of the most useful topics in math to learn for STEM students and I equally feel like I learned a ton from this course. But, unlike my other hard classes, I didn't really enjoy the struggle as much. In fact, after the first midterm, I actually started dreading this class because I just didn't feel like things clicked as they were supposed to. Yet, this is a very important class to take for a lot of STEM majors so I do recommend going in with an attitude receptive to learning.So, is this a good class? Maybe, but I for one am glad it is over.",0.9833,"This course was really tough! You spend minimum 3 hours on each pset (gets closer to 4–5 later in the semester), and considering there are 3 psets a week and only 1 drop for the entire semester, you're basically chained to this class every day. Each pset is long and tedious, and you can spend over 45 min on one part of one question just to get to a final answer that's probably wrong because you made some tiny algebraic error. It's also very unfair that the psets are only worth 20% of your final grade; you spend the bulk of your time in 21b working on the psets, yet ultimately it'll come down to how you perform on the midterms/final, which are themselves very difficult. The level of support for this class is also poor. There are very little office hours, and if you can't make it to MQC because of extracurriculars or some other reason, you're pretty much on your own for that pset.",-0.8878,,0.0,110989,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Mathematics,Mathematics,Yes,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Linear Algebra and Differential Equations

Do not recommend at all.First of all, this course needs a section. There is no real learning done in lecture, because the concepts are so varied and there is a lot to learn quickly. Thus, either the course needs to go slower in lectures or have a section.Second, the course needs a lot more office hours. The problem sets (which often do not cover what is covered in lecture, but rather what's in the book, although I would say that proof problems didn’t even cover that) required me to go to every office hour session, which is not how I think a course should be structured. Unlike other courses, however, these OHs are at extremely inconvenient hours (when all the clubs often meet, so I often had to give up on other meetings). Instead, other classes I took that are approximately the same size (both in class size and teaching staff size) have office hours at every hour of the day, which is much more convenient. This system allows to spread out the number of people at each OH, which was a huge problem this semester for Math 22 –– 1 TF and CA for every OH is not enough if there are 30 people waiting! This often meant not having my questions answered and wasting two hours not figuring anything out. The syllabus says collaboration is allowed, but I found it really hard to find people to work with, mainly because I noticed an unfortunate level of arrogance among everyone who is taking this class toward the less confident in the material. Sections based on confidence in the material would have been much better.Additionally, the teaching staff must be hired more carefully. I found it really hard most of the time to communicate with them, and some of them even shrugged at my question. Based on previous testimony, this is because to be a CA for Math 22 this year there was no selection – just a form to fill out. Needless to say, they were not great educators (except for NS, shoutout to her. She actually made me understand stuff but unfortunately she was only at OH for two hours a week). As someone coming into the course with a lot of calculus experience, this course does not have any of that, which was expected, but I would not consider it an introductory course if it is taught the same way it was taught this year. As a beginner, most of the time, PSets took me a long time (10+ hours). This will probably not apply to the overall average hours spent on the course but that is because half of the class has probably already had some kind of linear algebra experience. But, keep in mind my comments. Although the professor is very good as a human and responds to emails very fast, I don’t think this is a great class to take.

Experience with linear algebra and/or proof–writing is by no means a necessary prerequisite for this class, though is definitely helpful (still not necessary, but I do I think some exposure to proofs makes the class much more streamlined.) It is a relatively fast–paced class, though still slow enough to go through every topic in great detail. The course content mainly follows that of Axler and a bit of Artin.Regular attendance is extremely helpful (and also expected), though attendance is not specifically measured (however, you should note that lectures are not recorded, and posted lecture notes tend to be brief; thus, missing class on an objective level is generally not advised). Although this is Chris's first year teaching 25a, he is very knowledgeable and is well–prepared to teach us.  Furthermore, Chris is a great lecturer and very personable, making lectures engaging. There are no sections for this class, as usually only 30 students take it per year, but there are frequent office hours almost everyday of the week, which are really useful–– Chris, our TF Natalie, and the CAs go above and beyond to make sure you understand the material, and are great for pset help (ask them to check over your proofs!). Chris is very responsive to questions and feedback, so don't be scared to ask questions!Chris is a bit more forgiving in terms of class intensity and (overall) grading than what I've heard about Wes (who had taught 25a prior to this year), but you should still expect to spend a lot of time doing math: psets (one per week, due Wednesday at noon) will likely take at least 10 hours and up to 20. Note that psets will be graded more harshly (but midterm (one) and final grading is bit more charitable). Some further notes if you're in–between 22a, 25a, and 55a:22a provides a mainly computational approach to linear algebra, whereas 25a is much more rigorous and is proof–based. I would say that 25a is more of an extension of 22a, where 25a explores much more of the ""why"" to 22a (you will still need to know how to do computation, however, but is a smaller component of 25a). Meanwhile, 55a is a lot more fast–paced and goes in a bit less depth into linear algebra; you'll spend around two months on linear algebra, and then spend the rest of the time on multilinear algebra (& inner/outer algebras), category theory, and representation theory. I think generally 55a tends to be a little bit more collaborative in nature, but finding peers to work with during OH for 25a is pretty easy; also I think 25a psets are doable by yourself (might take a bit longer though), whereas 55a psets are not so much.",0.9966,,0.0,,0.0,110808,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Mathematics,Mathematics,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Theoretical Linear Algebra and Real Analysis I

I have lots to say, but if you don't read all of it, here's my most important point — more than teaching me math and preparing me for future studies (which it did very, very well), this course made me a smarter person. I can't fully describe it, and indeed it's somewhat uncanny — but after a semester of working through Math 55 problem sets, I genuinely notice that my mind is much sharper; I think more intelligently about the world (and I honestly didn't think that was possible) far outside of math. What more could I every ask from a course?Math 55 has a reputation. But no, it doesn't take over your life; you can still take other tough classes, be part of some clubs, and have time for your friends (believe me, I did it, and many others alongside me). Don't be fazed by the ""hours per week"" — it's much more manageable than you think. And yes, it's hard. But that's the best part. It's more than a class. You make so many close friends and find a wonderful community with your classmates, CAs, and the math department as a whole. Think of it this way: The College claims the First–Year Seminar Program is designed to help you integrate into the Harvard academic community — and that's true, but Math 55 is even better.The hardest part of the course isn't the content. It's the speed and the homework. But Joe Harris is amazing (and I'm sure whoever they assign to teach it in the future will be, too). I truly didn't notice the speed we were moving at — it always feels like he is moving slowly (in a good way), but he manages to cover so much content in a way that every person in the room understands. I have nothing but praise for him. Oh, and his lecture notes are the best. Side note — follow Joe Harris wherever he goes in his post–55 future. You won't regret it.Now for the best part — the homework. Math 55 problem sets are, well, a rite of passage. Yes, they're harder — in fact, I'll admit that they're harder than they need to be for you to learn the content. But solving the problems (whether on your own, or, more often than not, with your soon–to–be best friends) and writing up your proofs engages you with the content in a new way unlike any other assignment in any other course. Believe me, the course is the way it is for a reason — for you to learn, have fun, and make friends. If you like math, take advantage of it while you're here. There is quite literally no better exercise for your brain.You have to live it to know it, but Math 55 is a truly transformational experience unlike any other. In hindsight, I would pick Harvard over any other school just to take this course. There is no better way to start your Harvard journey. And you'll have so, so much fun along the way — from way too many inside jokes to memorable late nights in the math lounge. Enjoy.",0.999,"This class is way too quick and hard to actually learn anything if this is your first pass going through it, unless you happen to have Olympiad–level intelligence. I spent in excess of 30hrs a week JUST ON THE PROBLEM SETS and had barely enough time to try and fully understand the material. The grading is not too harsh and the course advisors are okay but I highly suggest you take something like 25 where you'll actually learn something. Lecture ranges from barely comprehensible to the class groaning by the end. If you don't work in a group you're probably screwed. In all likelihood you won't be able to finish a problem set by yourself, no matter how hard you try.",-0.7943,,0.0,113627,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Mathematics,Mathematics,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Studies in Algebra and Group Theory

I am now completely desensitized to notation overload, and I feel confident when a professor starts writing in Greek on a chalkboard.Some specific advice:Don't stress about the tests. There is a CHASM between the difficulty level of the problem sets and the tests. The tests tend to be the most basic possible question based on the material, while the problem sets can be very difficult  at the beginning (office hours are good).This class has very early midterms, which can be difficult but it also means that you won't have to study for this class and a normally–timed midterm at the same time.There are three problem set drops, and problem sets are graded very lightly. The CAs took months to grade our PSETS; we were getting psets from early November back after the final, so bear in mind you may not be getting much feedback until it's too late.Don't read Halmos, if it is assigned again.

Second half of the course also went OK — until the last 2/3 weeks–ish. To be fair, the 2nd half is way more interesting and beautiful math, but the last section on Seifert–van Kampen is pretty fast and kind of confusing if you don't already have at least a working knowledge of the intricacies of normal subgroups and quotienting. I feel like I only really understood Seifert–van Kampen after the final, which, needless to say, is too late. In any case, if you're fluent in set theory, knowledgable in rigorous calculus, and conversational in group theory, then take this course. Honestly, I wish I took 122 concurrently with this course. If you're coming from 22A/B, do this if you can and you'll likely be fine in a class with people coming from 25A/B, and even 55A. Even though I didn't, I ended up fine grade–wise ( I think/ hope). As with any math class, go to OH and have p–set buddies. Oh, and by the way, Auroux rocks. He might not teach this class in its next iteration, but he made it a lot better than it would have been under a professor who'd care less. So take note of who is teaching the class.",0.9941,,0.0,,0.0,111458,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Mathematics,Mathematics,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Topological Spaces and Fundamental Group

All in all though, I felt like I liked Colin's lecturing style when I understood it, and he brought a bit of informality to the class in terms of his energy that made the class more intimate (while also getting through a lot of material). To give you some reference on the difficulty of the class, Curt McMullen (who was teaching a graduate complex analysis course in the room the class period before us) asked us if this was a graduate combinatorics class early on in the semester. All in all, the office hours were helpful and the course staff and Colin made sure you knew the material if you asked for help. They were also generous with accepting unpenalized late work which was greatly appreciated by many of us. Next iterations of the course are not guaranteed to be as difficult since the course content and structure changes so much from year to year, so if you are looking for math classes to take try sorting by instructor if Colin isn't teaching this class next fall. Even without having to take exams, I feel like I have a really solid knowledge of algebraic combinatorics in general and other combinatorial objects based on how much I was thinking about them from week to week. Some problem set questions still have me a bit traumatized (the cute kind of trauma though).  I also really liked the topics that involved algorithms and drawing pretty pictures.

Both geometric intuition as well as the algebraic rigor are provided. – The course notes are very well–written. They are rather terse, but give helpful background and intuition, as well as presenting the main ideas of the proofs. – The course is divided into 5 sections: first, basic facts (e.g. material in math 55/113, though also with their relation to harmonic functions and consequently at times physics); then, Riemann surfaces and metrics (e.g., the hyperbolic plane, and the Schwarz Lemma); next, entire/meromorphic functions (main results: Hadamard factorization theorem, gamma function, consequences); fourth, the Riemann mapping theorem (which is a very beautiful theorem! intuition on the importance of the Schwarz Lemma is also provided); and lastly, elliptic functions and curves. The first four are very fundamental in standard complex analysis, and provide many important and general results of Hadamard/Riemann, etc. I also really enjoyed the final section, as a hint towards the consequences of the development done throughout the course on elliptic curves, which of course have many nice relations to algebra and number theory.  – I emphasize also the importance of having both the rigorous introduction as well as intuition and connections.

The first quarter of this course is 113 review but it is fast and not easy.2) Pay attention to the main ideas underlying all the theorems.

It covered a lot of very intriguing and foundational material (e.g., the main result of local CFT is very strong and amazing!)  – The course was very difficult. The problem sets in the first half of the course were quite long, though there were many HW problems which were directly related to course material (e.g. prove a fact used in lecture, etc.) The second half of the course consisted of shorter problem sets, which were mostly an application of the course material. The material was covered fairly quickly; for instance, infinite Galois theory (there were several problem sets which helped the material become familiar; it was however covered quickly). – It is helpful to know some mathematics outside of the stated prerequisites. In the first half of the course, 221 (commutative algebra) helps with understanding of, e.g., local rings, Dedekind domains, etc.: familiarity with algebra would make some of the problems easier. At some times, knowledge of cohomology would help (e.g. in Tate cohomology). These are not strictly necessary, but could enhance one's understanding of course material in a broader context.  – Prof. Wood gives very helpful intuition; for instance, in the proof of Hensel's lemma (cf. Newton's method). The course texts are fairly difficult to read: Serre is very terse (and cites Bourbaki frequently); most of the course follows the presentations in Neukirch, which is densely written but with more details; it helps significantly to attend lecture and gain intuition, as well as work through many details on one's own outside of the class.  – There is a review and final exam at the end of the course, which are very useful in regards to summarizing and reflecting on the material learned. Several important connections are made; for instance, Kummer Theory and CFT combine to give the Hilbert symbol.  – The last few lectures are largely a survey over many cool results (e.g. general reciprocity law, absolute galois group of separable closures, etc.) which are beyond the scope of the course.

Every week, you will also have a tutorial section, in which you either prepare a presentation on a clinical case for a small group to discuss, a 15 min presentation on the background of the disease, or a 10 min presentation on a novel research topic.

Sometimes I'd show up to class and we'd be discussing a completely different topic from what I was expecting. Thankfully, it doesn't really matter whether or not you did the correct readings (or any readings) – the students led the discussion each week, and nobody knew what was going on, so we just discussed whatever was most interesting to us. I read whichever readings looked interesting and skipped the rest. And despite her lack of organization, Dr. Etcoff is super sweet and happy to let the class unfold naturally, so I was never worried that the disorganization would hurt our grades.

If you want a taste of chem/bio, but don't need a class to fufil pre–med/life science concentration classes,  DON'T take this course. If you get placed into LPSA, take it instead of LS1A (it's better taught).Tips:1. Check your PSET and Lab answers at SSN (PSET) or CPM office hours (Lab). They make up a big portion of your grade and TF's can be harsh graders.2. Your TF will make or break this class. If you don't like your TF, find an extracurricular activity that conflicts with your section and put in a request to move sections. 3. Find 2 TFs you like and go to their office hours every week, even if you feel like you don't need to. Those extra 2 hours of *good* office hours saved me so much time studying/PSETing, but OH with a bad TF literally made me go backwards.4. You can sign up for 1–1 peer tutoring (drop in or with the same person) through the ARC, which is really helpful for studying. I would book 2 hours of peer tutoring during the week before each midterm and they would sit there while I did practice problems until I got stuck (win–win bc then they get paid to do their homework) and then if I was confused they would explain the problem.",-0.9528,,0.0,121189,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Molecular & Cellular Biology,Life Sciences,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,"An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences: Chemistry, Molecular Biology, and Cell Biology"

It will be one of the hardest classes you have ever taken, but you will also emerge with an amazing group of friends. The best part of LS50 is truly the community––the professors, TFs, and CAs are all very approachable and work hard to create a supportive environment in the class. Special shoutout to Emma Nagy for being the heart of LS50 and to Kara McKinley for her engaging and interactive lectures on Regenerative Biology. Aside from the teaching staff, the students in LS50 are some of the most intelligent and fascinating people you will meet at Harvard. You must seek out LS50 to be a part of it, so your peers will be some of the top STEM students at Harvard––people who will inspire you one moment and then invite you out for a meal the next (just hope you don't get a jalapeño burrito). In terms of content, LS50 is truly INTEGRATED science. This means that you will be learning everything from biology to chemistry to statistical mechanics and coding. This has both pros and cons. On the plus side, you will be exposed to many fascinating scientific specialities you didn't even know existed. However, this also means you will inevitably be exposed to something you don't like (I'm looking at you, stat mech––the bane of my existence). LS50 is also an incredibly difficult course. This is not for the faint of heart. You will be working on psets anywhere from 15–20 hours a week. Psets are impossible to complete on your own unless you are some kind of super–genius (which is entirely possible––like I said, LS50 is full of awesome people). Most psets will require help to complete, which you can find at office hours––hosted every night. Office hours are like the great melting pot of LS50 where much of the bonding takes place. You are bound to form great friendships when you and ten others are stranded at office hours until 11:30, desperately trying to figure out stat mech (which did in fact happen). Midterms are even harder than psets, and a sizable portion of the whole class fails every time. I would also say that part of the difficulty of LS50 comes from the vast discrepancy in scientific backgrounds. Some people in this class have done research all throughout high school, while others (aka me) have never even touched a beaker or pipette before this class. For the most part, the professors do a good job supporting all students, but sometimes prior knowledge of topics is assumed and you have to figure things out yourself. All that said, DON'T take LS50 if you're merely looking for an easy class. LS50 is no GEM; this is life science, not geology, and really intense life science at that. Don't take LS50 unless you're prepared to have it consume your life––you will be attending lecture every day, lab once a week, section once a week, and many additional office hours as well. LS50 takes the place of two classes, and you take it all year; it's literally half of your freshmen schedule, and probably way more than half of your headspace. Don't take LS50 unless you're prepared to reach out and make friends. As I stated above, LS50 has an incredible community, but only if you're willing to be an active member. Friendships don't just sprout up overnight; they are formed out of shared meals, evenings in Cabot pset–ing together, burrito runs in the middle of the night... If you put effort in, you'll get so much in return; if you put nothing in, well...just look to Newton's 1st law. And go take physics instead because we don't actually learn about Newton's 1st law in LS50. DO take LS50 if you truly love science and want to pursue science as a career. DO take LS50 if you want a small class where you can really get to know your professors. DO take LS50 if you want to be around some of the top STEM students a Harvard, and if you see yourself as one of these students ;). DO take LS50 if you want to make deep, meaningful friendships. DO take LS50 if you were able to read this entire crazy, unhinged rant! And finally, DO take LS50 if any of the following experiences sound meaningful to you. After all, science is all about observation, and here's some data culled from my freshmen fall experience: ––Playing spoon Assassins with the whole class ––Eating Thanksgiving with LS50 friends ––Watching a horror movie after the second midterm (what's scarier? Scream or stat mech. Take the class and then decide yourself). ––Staying at office hours until 11:30 (stat mech strikes again) ––Listening to the new TSwift Album with LS50 friends (Cabot party!)––Running to Jefe's at 4 am for pset sustenance ––And so many other memories!

You must seek out LS50 to be a part of it, so your peers will be some of the top STEM students at Harvard––people who will inspire you one moment and then invite you out for a meal the next (just hope you don't get a jalapeño burrito). In terms of content, LS50 is truly INTEGRATED science. This means that you will be learning everything from biology to chemistry to statistical mechanics and coding. This has both pros and cons. On the plus side, you will be exposed to many fascinating scientific specialities you didn't even know existed. However, this also means you will inevitably be exposed to something you don't like (I'm looking at you, stat mech––the bane of my existence). LS50 is also an incredibly difficult course. This is not for the faint of heart. You will be working on psets anywhere from 15–20 hours a week. Psets are impossible to complete on your own unless you are some kind of super–genius (which is entirely possible––like I said, LS50 is full of awesome people). Most psets will require help to complete, which you can find at office hours––hosted every night. Office hours are like the great melting pot of LS50 where much of the bonding takes place. You are bound to form great friendships when you and ten others are stranded at office hours until 11:30, desperately trying to figure out stat mech (which did in fact happen). Midterms are even harder than psets, and a sizable portion of the whole class fails every time. I would also say that part of the difficulty of LS50 comes from the vast discrepancy in scientific backgrounds. Some people in this class have done research all throughout high school, while others (aka me) have never even touched a beaker or pipette before this class. For the most part, the professors do a good job supporting all students, but sometimes prior knowledge of topics is assumed and you have to figure things out yourself. All that said, DON'T take LS50 if you're merely looking for an easy class. LS50 is no GEM; this is life science, not geology, and really intense life science at that. Don't take LS50 unless you're prepared to have it consume your life––you will be attending lecture every day, lab once a week, section once a week, and many additional office hours as well. LS50 takes the place of two classes, and you take it all year; it's literally half of your freshmen schedule, and probably way more than half of your headspace. Don't take LS50 unless you're prepared to reach out and make friends. As I stated above, LS50 has an incredible community, but only if you're willing to be an active member. Friendships don't just sprout up overnight; they are formed out of shared meals, evenings in Cabot pset–ing together, burrito runs in the middle of the night... If you put effort in, you'll get so much in return; if you put nothing in, well...just look to Newton's 1st law. And go take physics instead because we don't actually learn about Newton's 1st law in LS50. DO take LS50 if you truly love science and want to pursue science as a career. DO take LS50 if you want a small class where you can really get to know your professors. DO take LS50 if you want to be around some of the top STEM students a Harvard, and if you see yourself as one of these students ;). DO take LS50 if you want to make deep, meaningful friendships. DO take LS50 if you were able to read this entire crazy, unhinged rant! And finally, DO take LS50 if any of the following experiences sound meaningful to you. After all, science is all about observation, and here's some data culled from my freshmen fall experience: ––Playing spoon Assassins with the whole class ––Eating Thanksgiving with LS50 friends ––Watching a horror movie after the second midterm (what's scarier? Scream or stat mech. Take the class and then decide yourself). ––Staying at office hours until 11:30 (stat mech strikes again) ––Listening to the new TSwift Album with LS50 friends (Cabot party!)––Running to Jefe's at 4 am for pset sustenance ––And so many other memories!

The workload is lighter than Neuro 91 (only 6 hours compared to 15) and they set you up with a PI who shows you the ropes, so that structure is really nice. We have three presentations during the semester and that’s the only work besides weekly lab work, which you either do during the 3–5pm meeting time or on your own time, depending on the lab you’re in. Also, you have a choice of three labs after they each give an elevator pitch type presentation on the first day of class and I think basically everyone gets their first choice. All groups regardless of which lab you choose work out of the learning lab in Northwest so transportation is not an issue. My only qualm with this class is that I have no idea where I stand grade–wise. There is no syllabus to tell us if participation in lab work contributes to our grade, which is frustrating because half the people in my group never go to lab and collect data. Also, it doesn’t tell us what percentage of our grade the three presentations count for nor did we ever get graded feedback on any of the presentations. Finally, the final paper is a bit daunting because you write a grant proposal that is up to ten pages single spaced, yes I said single spaced. It’s nice that we write a partial draft and get feedback from our PI’s but I guess I wish there was a rubric? Or something that would help me know if I’m on track to get a good grade on it. I also don’t know what percent of our grade this final paper is worth. These are all issues that could easily be fixed and I would love to see them addressed in the next iteration of this course because this really is a great option for people that aren’t ready to take the leap into Neuro 91 :) Would I recommend this course? Yes…as long as I end up with an A.",0.9933,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

There are a lot of things I did not like about MCB 60, but in the end, I do appreciate the amount of knowledge I gained. So first, let me talk about the things that need to be fixed: the course structure and assignments. The PSETs and exams were ridiculously difficult for unfair reasons. The PSETs are meant to challenge students to think like researchers, but PSETs should also be an opportunity for students to have a safe–space to learn and actually practice thinking like a researcher. Instead, they are graded somewhat harshly (depending on the specific grader), and the pressure from having to get everything correct down to the last detail takes away from the best learning experience possible. Your homework should be designed so you learn from your mistakes, not for you to be afraid of making them. Unfortunately, these PSETs make up a large portion of your grade, so you just can't make mistakes or else. Also, the answer keys for the PSETs were often confusing and vague as well, so even that wasn't very helpful in the end. The office hours should be places where you can get questions cleared up, but for several of the office hours, the TFs were so focused on not giving away the answer that often they gave very vague guidance that made you walk away even more confused. I do recommend Janice's office hours though if she is still here. Also, the questions written on the PSETs are often written poorly and it can be super confusing on what the question is even talking about. What the question wants is also very vague. For instance, ""what does the figure suggest?"" Well, often the figure could suggest a lot of things, so you never know what the grader is actually looking for. The amount of time to get feedback is also not that great. By the time you receive feedback, you are already weeks ahead learning way different content. The shortcomings of the exams are very similar to what was described about the PSETs. The exams did get better as we grew over the semester, but the growth process was not the best. The first exam will be atrocious, but they will gradually be ok.  Lastly, you should be aware that the flipped–classroom style also takes away from the learning experience. The weekly pre–lecture videos did not do the best job explaining the background we needed to know for the week. The background would be quickly glazed over and then we immediately dive into problem solving. The textbook did a good job filling in the holes,  but it is still necessary to have detailed explanations on the week's concepts during instruction time just so we can all avoid confusion. However, we don't get that. The textbook reading assignments take up a lot of time and a lot of the content was never ever mentioned or applied again in class. It isn't the best use of time, but skipping it really wasn't a solution either since there are those one or two things you really need to know.  You don't know what is important until later, so you really can't sift through the material efficiently. It will be challenging thinking about the best way to study for this class, but in the end, you will survive. Despite the structure of the course needing some patch–up work, you will learn and grow a lot over the semester. I now have a better understanding of how the cell and body works like a machine. I enjoyed learning how prions are formed, how cell signaling happens, how stem cells work, and how the origins of cancer come to be among lots  of other cool topics. This course covered a lot of great details about how biology works, and it really made me appreciate the fascinating nature of cells. They seem to always have a way around solving problems, and I remember often feeling amazed by the intelligence and adaptability of these building blocks of life. Also, I think MCB 60 did a good job preparing us for lab and research experiences outside of class. Now I have a lot of practice using pipets, knowing how to use centrifuge, doing dilutions, reading gels, counting cells, plating cells, growing colonies, doing Western blot, and also reading research literature.",0.9939,"The lecture style is extremely unengaging. It's one of those flipped–classroom style course where you watch the modules before class and discuss questions with classmates in class, and the course heads manage this teaching style very poorly. You are supposed to think about the questions on the pre–lecture quizzes(which is due every week before Monday lecture), so  I personally felt like I have already done most of my thinking for a question while completing the quiz. Discussion with classmates rarely provided me with much new insight because either the answer was straightforward and warrants little discussion, or my classmates were equally confused. The time given to discussions is PROLONGED(often 5–10 minutes for a single question and altogether account for more than 70% of lecture time), which makes the pace of lecture very slow. At the end of discussion the professor would call on students to give their answers to the questions, but when the students' answers are not toally correct, the professor often fails to explain at the end what the correct answer is. For this reason, the lecture content is often disorganized and I have a difficult time taking notes I can use for exam review. My notes had to rely heavily on the textbook and the pre–recorded modules. The lecture component can be improved if the discussion time is cut down a bit and the professor gives more organized lecturing.  If you have to take this class as concentration requirement, prepare to expect little from the lectures and learn independently.",-0.7916,,0.0,110424,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Molecular & Cellular Biology,Molecular & Cellular Biology,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Cellular Biology and Molecular Medicine

You are supposed to think about the questions on the pre–lecture quizzes(which is due every week before Monday lecture), so  I personally felt like I have already done most of my thinking for a question while completing the quiz. Discussion with classmates rarely provided me with much new insight because either the answer was straightforward and warrants little discussion, or my classmates were equally confused. The time given to discussions is PROLONGED(often 5–10 minutes for a single question and altogether account for more than 70% of lecture time), which makes the pace of lecture very slow. At the end of discussion the professor would call on students to give their answers to the questions, but when the students' answers are not toally correct, the professor often fails to explain at the end what the correct answer is. For this reason, the lecture content is often disorganized and I have a difficult time taking notes I can use for exam review. My notes had to rely heavily on the textbook and the pre–recorded modules. The lecture component can be improved if the discussion time is cut down a bit and the professor gives more organized lecturing.  If you have to take this class as concentration requirement, prepare to expect little from the lectures and learn independently.",-0.7916,,0.0,110424,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Molecular & Cellular Biology,Molecular & Cellular Biology,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Cellular Biology and Molecular Medicine

If you read the Fall, 2022 Q–Report for this course, you will likely notice that many students describe MCB 63 as being a very easy course and a “gem” of a class, with one even saying that it is near impossible to not get an A. However, this is only partially true, with it being highly dependent on your prior experience within the field of Biology, Chemistry, and Biochemistry.At its core, most of the students that are taking MCB 63 have either (1) already taken CHEM 27, another Biochemistry–focused class, or (2) already taken or are in the process of preparing to take the MCAT. As a result, many students enter this course with some form of background on the subject. For students that do not have this background, MCB 63 will be significantly harder, and you will likely feel way behind your peers. In the syllabus, since SGA’s, which are basically reminiscent of PIE’s from LS1a/LS1b are only worth 30% of our course grade, it may seem really easy. However, the SGA’s are very difficult at times, with some not even matching up with the list of objectives we were provided with beforehand. It is very easy to perform poorly on an SGA, as they are graded out of just 30 points (so each mistake costs a lot!) Additionally, with them occurring bi–weekly, it makes it seem like MCB 63 is basically always absorbing your time and causing you stress. It gets especially bad for the final two, which are lined up back to back and cover 6 lectures worth of material at once. Additionally, please know that there are NO GRADE CUTOFFS SET for the course. According to a student from the previous year, they ended with a ~94.5% but still received an A– in the course. For those that are very wary about their GPA’s, please take this into consideration as we are unsure how final grades are decided. At the time of writing this, I still have no clue what I will be ending with in the class.In terms of the class itself, the topics are definitely interesting, but it is very difficult to tell what is important to know/memorize, especially since Professor Viel can get very detailed in his explanations.

We also received very little guidance on the final essays, not even a rubric on which we would be graded. We were consistently told not to worry about grading, but you actually do need to worry.

There are lots and lots of details and it takes WORK to memorize all of them. I was studying for this class weekly — it was maybe 40% less weekly studying than LS2, for reference. Don't let the ""3 psets"" fool you into thinking it's an easy class; you have to be disciplined and study because there is just too much information to memorize at the last minute. Don't worry about reading the textbook, just make sure you stay on top of HMX and are paying attention in lecture/studying your lecture notes weekly because if you zone out you miss a lot, and most of the time lecture slides are not at all helpful. So if you miss something you have to ask a friend or go back and rewatch the lecture. However, lectures are really interesting and engaging. Dr. Pillai is a great speaker. Sometimes he goes a bit fast and you will inevitably miss important points. But your section leaders have your back, so pay attention in section too and you'll be fine!

I came to appreciate the truth of nuance. It truly, truly, was a transformative experience. The expectations of the course are very straightforward and set in the syllabus. The exams are quite easy (I ended up with over a 100 in the class), and Professor Teeter provides a study guide that lets you know specifically what to study. The course does a good job of catering to individuals who have no prior experience with the Bible and those for whom the text is familiar literature. You learn a LOT in a very short period.Also, Professor Teeter and Byron are two of the nicest faculty members at Harvard that I have ever met. Professor Teeter exudes this positive energy and contagious excitement about the content. Byron's a grading machine, getting papers and exams back to you sometimes within the same day.

If you have a chance to take it you absolutely should, regardless of background and prior experience. It has changed my perspective on not just books, but the history and development of modern life. Professor Stern is an incredible professor and puts so much time each week into curating an amazing selection of books, readings, and lectures.Every week you get to spend time in Houghton looking at some of the most pivotal and incredible scrolls/manuscripts/books from throughout history (and you're actually allowed to flip through them and examine as you wish!). The assignments are manageable and well thought through, allowing you to deepen your knowledge and engagement with the material. This year we had weekly readings, weekly short reading responses (completion–based), and two papers at the middle and end points of the semester. The class was held in different locations each week including the Divinity School, the Law School, Dana Palmer, and more. As well as giving you a great opportunity to explore the libraries of Harvard, it means the breadth of material on offer is vast. There are also really cool extra sessions such as the printing workshop where we learnt to use a printing press and a visit the the book restoration building where we learnt how books were bound. Additionally, we were able to speak to so many cool guest speakers and auditors from a whole range of different backgrounds.A nice extra bonus of this class is learning how to navigate and make the most of the Harvard libraries. Whether you are hoping to do some research/thesis or just want to make the most of everything the Harvard collection's have to offer, this course helps you build great relationships with librarians and learn how to make the most out of all the resources on offer.

The field trips were really fun, as was getting to know the TFs and their research. If you’re interested in pursuing ecological field work, it’s a great class to start getting an idea of some quantitative methods and conceptual understanding of ecological processes.Unfortunately, communication was a big weakness.

Metaphysics and history of philosophy tend to be the areas of the field that I am the least interested in, but I took this course because I had previously taken Phil 8 with Professor Simmons and was very impressed with her. That turned out to be an excellent decision as this was easily one of my favorite classes I have taken during my time at Harvard. Professor Simmons is always available to meet and discuss content (or anything else in philosophy) and I found some of the best discussion happened during office hours. The course itself has a very manageable workload, though reading philosophy closely is always time consuming. There are low–stakes weekly reading responses which you get feedback on, which is helpful. Throughout the semester there are also assignments that serve as preliminary steps in writing a final research paper. At the end of the semester when it came time to sit down and actually write my research paper I realized I was done with all the most tedious parts, and the paper itself was then quite easy to write. I think I produced some of my best writing thanks to this structure, and the feedback on the final paper was extremely helpful.

He has a very different approach to philosophy than others I've encountered; he is far less concerned with doing a rigorous reconstruction all of the time and far more interested in getting at and exploring what an argument is really saying. While each approach has its advantages and disadvantages, it is wonderful to experience the latter as someone not previously exposed.

You start with the works of Rawls, but pretty much all the rest of the readings are either politically charged ramblings or direct appeals to emotion. This is not to say the readings were bad; Waldron's article on the lack of freedoms for the homeless, in particular, was extremely striking. In general, I'd say the readings are extremely one sided, but at least interesting. Philosophical rigor is rather low.Prof. Stanczyk is every stereotype of a male humanities professor rolled into one. He's pretty nice, and quite funny, which is always good. However, his lectures are just an endless onslought of pure appeals to emotion with very little in the way of actual philosophy. He also very clearly leans extremely far to the left on pretty much every issue, and invited speakers who openly described themselves as socialist. This is neither good nor bad in a vacuum, but definitely something to be aware of when stepping into this class.Both Isaijah and Rachael are absolutely phenomenal, wonderful people and teachers.

He's fantastic, and I really hope I get the pleasure of taking another class with him before I leave Harvard.",0.9956,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

Lectures and the live demos are very engaging.  The hands–on component of the course is a huge plus––one of the best opportunities at Harvard in my opinion to actually practice and implement engineering techniques (rather than just studying them conceptually on paper).  I started this class not knowing anything about any sort of fabrication, and I learned so much and had so much fun in this class.  I HIGHLY recommend this class for anyone who feels that Harvard's engineering/science courses are too theoretical––this is a great way to learn how to actually build things.

This class was helpful as a low–workload way to do that. I saw that I find the research interesting, but the structure of academia is not appealing to me, and so if I go to grad school it would be a couple years after graduating college and not immediately. The big assignments are a presentation and a 10–page paper. I found the paper difficult because for some reason I chose a topic I am not terribly interested in, but I see that if you choose a topic you care about it could be a very helpful and enjoyable assignment. The presentation was difficult, however, because they are on topics you probably won't have sufficient background on to explain in depth. Professor Westervelt will help with the presentation, but that also makes it a bit more confusing. For example, he helped me prepare my presentation, and then when I did the example we discussed in front of the class, he said to use a different one and I got rather confused. He also takes over talking for most of the presentation since the point is for everyone to learn about the topic and he will almost surely know more about it than you, so don't be alarmed or worried about your grade if he just starts talking for 10 minutes in the middle of your presentation; the presentation is not formal like that.",0.9551,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

Professor Jaffe was great – both at teaching and at using the small class size to its advantage by making it as interactive as possible. TF Serhii Kryhin deserves a special mention for his accessibility, dedication, patience and great explanations. The class community is smaller than that of the typical physics course at Harvard, and as a result usually has a more informal feel to it which gives it the potential to be (and in my experience, was) something special. The material is a really nice breath of fresh air, especially when contrasted with one's typical ubiquitous and frustratingly boring first encounter with classical mechanics, and was both beautiful in itself as well as having many interesting connections with various bits of physics and mathematics such as quantum mechanics, lie algebras, differential geometry and more – definitely gained a totally new appreciation for something I once found so dry and lifeless. The problem sets and exams were a good opportunity to practice working with things that will undoubtedly be seen again and again in modern physics courses such as GR and QFT – sometimes the ""bash"" felt a bit much but it always resolved to something nice that is consistent with good intuition and felt like a good conceptual takeaway. One critique is that more preparatory material for the exams would be much appreciated – don't think anyone in the class was that clear on exactly what to study, especially before the first midterm. Overall, I find that the course does a great job of balancing beauty and rigour, and I greatly recommend it to all concentrators – especially to those who are interested in the more theoretical side of physics and to those who are looking for a fun and unique course. (Specific groups of people to whom I would recommend this to especially:Ex–Physics–19ers who found the snippets of analytical mechanics interestingAnyone who needs a mechanics requirement but has gotten sick to death of Newtonian mechanics (I belong in this category)Freshmen looking for a lighter course than 16 which teaches similar material (could imagine that this would be especially good to have under your belt before Physics 251 for more maths–forward physics students)",0.9968,,0.0,"This was far and away my favorite class of the semester, and one of my favorite classes of my time at Harvard so far. I had already taken 15a my freshman fall, but I absolutely do not regret going back for a second pass at mechanics. It is a completely different subject when looked at more deeply, and far more beautiful than I gave it credit for before taking this class. The main content of the class revolves around symmetries and conserved quantities in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, a subject that (as professor Jaffe stressed over and over) had very deep connections to modern–day quantum theory.Due to the small class size, we all became pretty close by the end of the class. This was in large part fostered by the gem of a TF, Serhii––try and take any class he TF's in the future, not just 151! Professor Jaffe gave incredible lectures for the most part, and would frequently drop incredibly stories about his life and career. He is an incredibly physicist and a really sweet person––the class party at his house at the end of the semester was definitely a highlight!The only downsides I found in the class were the problem sets and tests. Many of the problem sets (biweekly) were short, so the workload was very manageable for the majority of the semester. However, I found the pset questions to be very detached from the material we were learning in class, with much time spent on endless bashing without any noticeable benefit. The exams were stressful, with professor Jaffe not giving any practice exams or practice problems and forbidding cheat sheets (his teaching style is very old school in general). However, the two in–class midterms comprised only 20% of our grade this semester, so it wasn't the worst thing in the world.We had a final project as our final assessment for the class, which was really fun, albeit quite stressful. It is incredibly how deep of a subject classical mechanics is, and I don't think you get to experience its beauty in any other class at Harvard.Overall, I think that Physics 151 is as close to a gem of a class as you're going to get in the Physics department––relatively low stress and low workload, very interesting and relevant content, and an unforgettable experience with incredible people! I would highly recommend incoming freshman take this class over 15a, 16, or 19 to fulfill their mechanics requirement, especially if you have a decent linear algebra background. (Without a solid linear algebra foundation, it's very hard to appreciate a lot of the material we covered.)",0.952,111231,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,Physics,Physics,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Mechanics

The lectures were very disjointed and disorganized, and the two professors often seemed to be in conflict with each other to the point where it was uncomfortable to be in class. Melissa (the physics professor) also seemed to be disinterested in, or have disdain for, both literature and the students in the class.

I have wanted to take a course about writing about science and this course was everything I hoped it would be, and so much more. Prof. Messud and Prof. Franklin's lectures are incredible; I learned so much from both of them and I appreciated their complementary approaches. I also really enjoyed the guest lectures they arranged for the course: it was so cool to hear from the authors whose work we were reading! I learned a lot from the course readings and appreciated the variety of styles we encountered. The course readings are also really fun and engaging; we read poetry, fiction, essays, science journalism, history of science articles, and much more. I also really appreciated the teaching staff who were very knowledgable, helpful, and dedicated. I regularly attended the professors' office hours as well as the teaching fellows' office hours and I found these sessions to be extremely helpful.

There are much easier ways to learn AMO than taking this class. Sure, you learn a lot of AMO, but at a high cost. The first pset takes 25 hours and is the hardest of the semester, but that is mainly because it has questions that the class covers 2 months into the semester. So you spend a lot of hours just reading other textbooks to figure out what is happening, and you learn a good chunk of the course in that one pset. The final project is not that difficult since you get to work with a group. The course has one hour of office hours every two weeks with the TFs, and then Lukin has weekly office hours, but they are not the most helpful. Maybe it is because this is a grad class, but if you are lost on a problem, the TFs won't tell you how to do it. They will give you hints, but if you are lost and can't understand the hints, all you can do is hope one of your friends knows how to do it. Also, the problems are very hand–wavy, so you can't even really rigorously do the calculations, and you just have to ask the TFs which approximations are allowed and which are not. Furthermore, only pset 1 was graded for me after around a month, and then the remaining 5 psets were graded after the final project. This means I had one piece of feedback the entire course, so I could not tell where I needed to improve before it was too late to do anything. Some grad students are required to take this, but generally the undergraduates cared more about getting things right because of grades. This meant that when undergraduates worked with grad students on the psets, the undergrads would start early, and then the grad students would just work on it a few days before the biweekly pset is due. This means that the undergrads sort of just work on the psets themselves, which also feeds into the unnecessary difficulty of the class. The class has a reputation of being difficult, but it definitely does not have to be. For instance, if the first pset covered more fundamentals like which parts of quantum people should know instead of material later in the course, then students would be better prepared to tackle those questions after the class teaches it.",0.9321,"In this class, you may struggle, you may fail but you will see everything pays off.",-0.4404,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

But definitely don't expect to come out of the class with a rigorous understanding of any one of them –– this is very much a survey–type class. The first 1/3 of the class (information theory) is definitely the best organized and taught part of the  course. The second 1/3 is statistics (a subset of stat 111 covering MLE and Bayesian stat). Idk, maybe it was just me, but after taking a real stat course, their way of doing things looked pretty sloppy and confusing. The last 1/3 is ML, which was interesting and although it had a fair amount of overlap with cs 181, I still learned a lot of new things and gained some intuition.I did take this class after stat 111 and cs 181, which I wouldn't necessarily recommend since it was a bit repetitive. However, Sharad is an excellent lecturerer and the way he motivated everything using information theory and the perspective of a physicist/biologist was still quite new and interesting to me. I think it says something about the class that I still learned from it even coming in with a decent background.The problem sets for this class were decent, but you kind of had no idea what you were going to get. Sometimes they were super easy, sometimes super hard/fancy coding, and sometimes incredibly tedious algebra. MULTIPLE TIMES they would have these problems that were worded in an incredibly confusing way that nobody could figure out (eg has a paragraph of incomprehensible text and then asks about some variables that aren't even defined in the text). Then, when you went to ask the professor or the TFs they seemed to have no idea what the problem was trying to ask either or would give conflicting / self –contradictory explanations of the question. Like ??? The course staff is super chill, so it's ok. It was just a bit weird LOL.",0.9933,"This was one of my favorite, perhaps the favorite class, I've taken at Harvard. Despite being familiar with some of the material, I was excited to go to lecture and see how Sharad thought about it. We spent ~2 weeks in CS 181 on the expectation maximization algorithm, and Sharad presented it more clearly in 45 minutes. He is an incredibly engaging lecturer and it really feels like he has a deep, intuitive understanding of what he is talking about. The course moves quickly over topics sometimes, but I it is intended to be a survey course, and I think it is an excellent survey course. The one downside I'd say is that it was a bit unclear how to complete some of the problem set questions sometimes, but that was more of minor irritant than a major problem with the course.",-0.5367,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

It is a bit technical and you will not necessarily look forward to every lecture, BUT Professor Lukas still manages to make every class as interesting and engaging as possible and manages what can be pretty dry material into a funny and lively lecture. Also, while I admittedly would sometimes get bored in class or not be enthused about the process of learning, it is really interesting and important content once you learn it. It is one of the few courses I would talk about outside of classes saying things like ""did you know that..."" or ""I just learned..."" I really do feel like I learned a lot. It is definitely one of the more impactful courses I have taken at Harvard. I learned a TON about how drugs actually work in the brain and the true risks and benefits of different kinds of drugs and medications. Professor Lukas is incredibly intentional about the course and has very clear purpose for teaching. Yes, he cares about the content of the course and you need to learn some nitty–gritty material, but he generally cares way more about the more overarching lessons and takeaways than the super specific details. Additionally, he clearly cares a ton about the WHY it's important to know the material and emphasizes content that has real world implications, such as emphasizing the true relevant dangers and uses of each drugs. You can just tell he is a compassionate doctor and researcher that is in this field for one reason only: to help patients and reduce suffering. I feel way more knowledgable in the content of this course, but more than that, I feel like I have a much better grasp of why it matters and can distinguish what is fear–mongering and fleeting anti–drug morality versus what is actually relevant as it pertains to people's suffering, addiction, risks, etc. Additionally, it is quite reasonable in terms of workload and expectations. It is pretty low weekly workload if you attend lecture, but it's not necessarily a gem, you likely will need to study and review concepts and it's definitely not an auto A, but it is very manageable and generally, your grade is reflective of what you deserve.

I'm a psych minor and thought the class was an absolute GEM –– the readings don't end up being too bad as long as you understand their main points and results/conclusions, and it's really easy to inadvertently hit the (very non–strict) 500–word discussion post guideline while simply explaining your takeaways, so the weekly assignments were really not time–consuming (contrary to my expectations). The ""seminar leader"" assignment seems like a lot, but it's really just explaining the readings from your chosen week and asking the class to discuss some questions, and Ryan is really helpful with preparing for it. The final paper also ends up being pretty chill because a good chunk of it is regarding your personal takeaways from the literature, which is not hard to write about.Ryan is an awesome professor, really understanding, flexible with assignments, and responsive. At no point in the semester did I ever feel really pressured by this course because most work just followed smoothly from understanding the readings and was evaluated really fairly as long as it was clear you'd thought about the material a bit.  He would frequently go on interesting natural tangents that really helped me 1) mentally connect the course material to other parts of psychology, 2) get insight into parts of psychology I hadn't learned before, and 3) genuinely enjoy and look forward to class each week. If nothing else, I really appreciated a crash course he gave on how to efficiently read a psych paper, which's helped me a LOT with both understanding them and cutting down the time I need to do so, as well as his explanations of some commonly used statistical models in psych papers that I hadn't known about before and served as helpful statistical refreshers. My favorite part of this class was the small seminar discussion feel, since that made it really easy to participate (which was not graded harshly at all) and share/get opinions from Ryan and the class, so oftentimes the class felt like a mutually beneficial dialogue incorporating many different perspectives on why/how something might be the case.I really recommend PSY 1711 as long as you're interested in some of the seminar topics or personality psychology overall. I definitely understand behavioral/personality psychology MUCH better because of this course –– holistically, not solely limited to each week's specific topics –– because of the helpful frameworks/intuition I got throughout the semester. Not much of psychology I've been exposed to before put this much emphasis into how situational factors affect one's personality both short–term and long–term, and I feel much more able think about them both theoretically and with application to better understand my own life now. The course also covers a slew of topics not really touched on in other PSY courses I've taken, from self–concept to social media's impact on personality, and oftentimes really recent research on those subjects. While I was obviously more interested in some topics than others, I thought the class was extremely enlightening overall and definitely had some new takeaways I appreciated from each week. Overall, I thought the breadth this course covered while still keeping a coherent focus on situations' influence on personality psychology was extremely impressive and helpful to learn from, and the class environment/setting made it really easy and enjoyable to do so.",0.9988,"TAKE THIS COURSE!

Professor Greene is absolutely fantastic and engaging and knows how to encourage discussion while also providing guidance where necessary. He is clearly very knowledgable and a few of the readings we read were written by him. This course is essentially completely discussion based, truly following a ""no right answers"" motto, but with readings that offer evidence and philosophy allowing for strong arguments to be formulated. This course not only progressed my academic knowledge on these topics but also caused a reevaluation of my morals and beliefs I have and truly feel like I grew as a person in my perception and understanding of myself and the world.

She cares about her students, makes class really engaging with frequent discussions and group work. She is extremely knowledgeable in clinical psych, speaks about her own experiences, and is pretty interesting to listen to. The class is super chill, and it never felt like a chore. 2–3 light readings a week and you only have to respond to two in the whole semester, an assignment ~every other week (the longest was a 4–5 page group paper & presentation but we had like 3 weeks for it), and 2 hour lecture once a week flew by (plus she always gave a break halfway through and brought us pizza on presentation day). The weekly appchats (you only do one a smester) were really cool because we got to discuss our own experiences with social media apps, some that I had never even heard of.

I found this course to no more rigorous––in fact, even easier––than the QM courses I took in undergrad. This course basically covers scattered topics in Griffiths but at a pretty shallow level. It teaches some applications like band structure, rotating wave approximation, quantum info, etc., but I found those to be rather pointless since many people plan to take solid–state, AMO, and QI anyways, which cover those topics more thoroughly. By taking this course instead of a more rigorous grad QM course, I felt underprepared for the other course I took this semester and future physics courses. PSETs and exams are easy but often algebraically tedious, which made them just busywork. The grading also made me feel like I had gone back to high school after graduating undergrad––it's been a hot sec since I've seen points being taken off for not showing enough work even though my answer was correct and I understood what I was doing. But to be fair, the course assignments/sections are very pedagogical and probably useful if you don't have a solid undergrad QM background. And the easier, biweekly PSETs allow for more time spent on research (unlike physics251a where PSETs are weekly).You're required to take this course if you're in QSE, but I would suggest stalling until your later years or until this requirement is relaxed (probably unlikely though).",0.9796,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

There are much easier ways to learn AMO than taking this class. Sure, you learn a lot of AMO, but at a high cost. The first pset takes 25 hours and is the hardest of the semester, but that is mainly because it has questions that the class covers 2 months into the semester. So you spend a lot of hours just reading other textbooks to figure out what is happening, and you learn a good chunk of the course in that one pset. The final project is not that difficult since you get to work with a group. The course has one hour of office hours every two weeks with the TFs, and then Lukin has weekly office hours, but they are not the most helpful. Maybe it is because this is a grad class, but if you are lost on a problem, the TFs won't tell you how to do it. They will give you hints, but if you are lost and can't understand the hints, all you can do is hope one of your friends knows how to do it. Also, the problems are very hand–wavy, so you can't even really rigorously do the calculations, and you just have to ask the TFs which approximations are allowed and which are not. Furthermore, only pset 1 was graded for me after around a month, and then the remaining 5 psets were graded after the final project. This means I had one piece of feedback the entire course, so I could not tell where I needed to improve before it was too late to do anything. Some grad students are required to take this, but generally the undergraduates cared more about getting things right because of grades. This meant that when undergraduates worked with grad students on the psets, the undergrads would start early, and then the grad students would just work on it a few days before the biweekly pset is due. This means that the undergrads sort of just work on the psets themselves, which also feeds into the unnecessary difficulty of the class. The class has a reputation of being difficult, but it definitely does not have to be. For instance, if the first pset covered more fundamentals like which parts of quantum people should know instead of material later in the course, then students would be better prepared to tackle those questions after the class teaches it.",0.9321,"In this class, you may struggle, you may fail but you will see everything pays off.",-0.4404,,0.0,223843,Primarily for Graduate Students,Quantum Science & Engineering,Quantum Sci and Engineering,,None,,Lecture,Modern Atomic and Optical Physics II

The course does a great job balancing many things that you might want from an introductory course. In terms of New Testament thought/history, we get fair/detailed treatment of theological/theoretical perspective through the gospels, epistles, and early Patristic theologies. In terms of history, we get a considerable overview from the early Church, heresies, schisms, and the Protestant Reformation into America. Notable too is the time spent on more modern reception ––– Kant, feminism, liberation theology, etc. In terms of methodology/medium, while most of the course is certainly focused on texts, there's considerable exploration beyond philosophy/theology and into art, poetry, personal narrative, etc. Even with the preconceptions of what I thought I wanted from this course (specific interests on aspects of history/theology) and what I thought I already ""knew,"" I learned so much in the variety of new topics as well as in a deepened and changed understanding of areas I thought I knew. The format of the course I think is well–balanced with a variety of readings, a chance for personal reflection with Canvas responses, chance to reflect in class, but also (most appreciated at least in my perspective) a really thoughtful and quite detailed mini–lecture of the concepts introduced in our readings at the beginning of class. This was honestly really helpful in so many ways ––– whether it was explaining certain doctrines of law and sin, the particular context of monastic hierarchies, or just what on earth was being really argued in regards to heresy.  Briefly, too, on some logistics ––– Professor Lamberth is just an amazing person to get to know and makes the classroom experience wonderful. The course never becomes overbearing, either, with grading or workload and just allows you to focus on and enjoy the content of the course.If you're looking for a course that delves really deeply into literary analysis of the Bible or a more theological side to interpreting what is or is not said in the Bible, I think you might be a little let down ––– something like ANE 120A might be more of that exegetical/analytic stuff you're looking for. What this course instead offers, which I think is just as important, is a really informative overview of different ways we can understand the New Testament ––– whether that be identifying some core literary themes of the Scripture and early texts, tracking themes of debate and argumentation within the Church, or studying the changes in modern reception to the New Testament. Even if the course isn't a theological Bible study of the text or a debate–driven course on what the New Testament does or doesn't say about modern ethical issues, this course is wonderful for equipping you with a lot of critique yet respect for the tradition. I walked away realizing how much more complicated and diverse the Christian tradition is, and I think that students find this regardless of whether they are students of religion, people of personal belief in the religion, agnostic or atheistic skeptics of the religion, etc.",0.9949,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

This class is not too difficult, but it is usually discomforting in the first couple days because you essentially required to speak, and subsequently, think in French only. I took French 20 based on my placement score and the fact that Dr. Turman said I made a good fit for the class since I already had the fundamentals from my high school french class (verb conjugations, prepositions, etc.) even though it had not taken it since freshman year. However, since this is an ""intermediate"" class, students are not expected to be super skilled at speaking. Other than that, the class was good. The homework (Dossiers) are graded on completion and give you more insight on various Francophone countries and vocabulary based on various themes (e.g. education, family, etc.). My advice: Work on them as soon as you receive them. As a STEM student, I kept leaving these assignments off to the last minute because I left my psets consume my time. You'll want to study the vocabulary and grammar sooner rather than later as well. What I didn't like about the course, but it was necessary, were the Boomalang conversations. You choose which Francophone speaker you want to have a 15–minute conversation with and review the voice recording and complete a reflection on them. Sometimes I felt uncomfortable with attempting to create new sentences when talking to my speaker, but it pushed me to think more on the spot.The quizzes were okay. The prof provided practice quizzes so that we could sharpen our grammar, and they are generous when it comes to grading them in terms of spelling errors or wrong conjugations. You'll also have to write two 400–500 word compositions based on a theme they assign you. But luckily, they provide a pre–write assignment, which basically has you answering questions that help you make an outline of your composition. Lastly, the Experience Culturelle Project is essentially your final. You have to participate in a French activity and essentially create an in–depth reflection about your experience and then present your findings in presentation in front of your class. Thankfully, the class provides a couple of opportunities for you to complete your project (e.g. Haitian Folkloric and West African dance classes). When I presented I was extremely nervous and I would mispronounce some of the words or spoke too fast. However, know that everyone else in class that has to present is probably feeling the same as you. The culturelle project presentation may be the first time you will have presented in front of others speaking only in French. Oh! And one more thing: Do not be intimidated. What do I mean? There will be students in your French class that will have various strengths compared to you. Some may be better at speaking in French, but have poor writing or grammar skills. The purpose of this class is to help refine and introduce grammar that you'll see more frequently as you continue learning more about the Francophone language. In short, this class is doable, just complete your assignments on time and genuinely practice on sharpening your French vocabulary and practice speaking everyday phrases.",0.9942,,0.0,,0.0,126938,Primarily for Undergraduate Students,Romance Languages & Lit,French,,None,,Lecture,Intermediate French: Francophone Culture in Local Communities

Patricia has tried her best, and I try not to blame her, however, the structure of the course is really poor. For an INTRO to Spanish class, there is !A LOT! that is expected from you, and Patricia will spend little to know time reinforcing concepts that we've learned in the past, she just expects that you know them. Once again, for an introductory class, this is unbelievable. You would think there is more built–in support so that students can go over things they have learned again and again so that it solidifies in their brain. The whole idea of learning a language is repetition, repetition, and more repetition. There was little to none of that in this course; we would just breeze through topics week after the next. What's the rush? Just slow the course down.The whole expectation is that YOU make time for office hours and go in and practice with her more... why? Everyone needs more help and practice, why can't you just build it into the class? On top of all of this, the quizzes and exams have been HEINOUS! There are no study–guides, no review, nothing. One time, during class, a student asked Patricia ""so, what is the expectation for the exam? What material is good a good idea to review?"" And Patricia just said to study everything in the past. Every. Single. Thing? Really? It was insane. The least she could've done is curated a list of verbs that we should know (as they were scattered EVERYWHERE in Canvas rather than in one concise place), and small topics that we should review (for example, telling us that we should know our colors, or we should know how to describe someones appearance, or we should know how to talk about the past). Honestly, this course has been INSANE and one of the worst I've taken in my time here as a student at Harvard. I am just so disappointed and I really hope that the structure takes a huge hit and changes.",0.8251,"This is a good intro, but be careful who you get as a professor.

Don't get me wrong there probably was a lot of use of translators by a lot of students, but he would take out his frustration on everyone within the class.

Please take it! My ability to understand and speak Spanish improved immensely over this course. Coming in I could not have a conversation and now I can. A lot of the coursework is watching movies which was not only fun but also an incredibly useful method of comprehension practice. We also read short stories every week, and we discuss the two in class. The sections themselves are pretty chill as we mostly talk about the readings and movies, but they work to improve your Spanish.I would recommend going to office hours while writing the compositions. The essays are not stressful or graded particularly harshly, but going to office hours will improve both your composition and your writing ability.Coming in I thought the class would be too hard and I was planning to drop to Spanish 30 because although my placement score put my in Spanish 40, I had gotten a 4 on the AP and my AP class was barely a real class.  However, this class pretty much meets you where you are, and I felt that it was the right level for me.

I came into this course as a non–native but fluent Spanish speaker, and I was super nervous about my ability to keep up. There was definitely a period of adjustment in terms of my language comprehension, but Alejandra was super understanding  and reassuring — it's okay to make language mistakes! After the initial hump, I was perfectly fine and was able to communicate complex ideas about feminism in Spanish by the end of the course. There is far too much reading for you to reasonably finish before each class (about a book per class, which met twice per week), but we always had plenty to discuss, and even in weeks where I had only read the wikipedia page and skimmed the first fifteen pages, I was completely fine.

Each week is a cool discussion on a subject from Polish history and particularly literature/film which reflect specific periods or historical movements. I didn't have much knowledge about Polish history or culture before the class and felt like through the class I've learned so much fascinating material. If you're considering taking the class as long as you find the material on the syllabus interesting, I would definitely recommend the class.",0.972,"Just take it. Many themes in Polish culture are of course specific to Polish history, but many of the artistic achievements you learn from the class are appealing universally. It's also sad that despite the global eminence of Polish literature, it is not well represented in the United States. I strongly believe that even if you study British, American, or German literature, your knowledge of Polish literature/culture will enrich your understanding of the field.",-0.0054,TAKE THIS CLASS! It is truly a GEM because of how accessible Dr. Kremer makes all the material. Even if you have no background in Polish history all the readings are understandable and fascinating. You walk away from this class with an immense amount of knowledge on how a country could undergo so many changes in such a short period of time. Class meets only once a week but the discussions that we have are so enriching because you get to see how everyone interprets such dense material through multifaceted perspectives. The assignments are also manageable and fun because they challenge you to write about difficult topics at times.

I came into this class taking it as an elective, but ended up changing my major to social studies because I liked it so much :)Social Studies 10 can have a bit of an intimidating reputation, but don't be dissuaded by that – it's not as hard as people make it out to be. The readings are very interesting, and as long as you get through all of them before section, you're pretty much guaranteed to do well in the course.Social Studies 10 is also the quintessential Harvard course – you'll get to hear from all sorts of expert social sciences faculty and read theory that's applicable to pretty much every field of study. The small tutorial size is also great – you'll get a lot of individual attention and be able to build up a close relationship with your tutorial leader. Definitely one of the most unique and worthwhile courses I've ever taken.",0.9846,"I would not recommend this course unless you have to take it for Social Studies. Too much material is squeezed into too little of a time period. Lectures range from good to bad, mostly bad. There's absolutely no reason to have 1 two hour lecture a week, and the class would greatly benefit from having two hour long lectures instead. Section is engaging, but way too long. It is exhausting, and not because it's so rigorous, but because it is too long. There's not enough structure given to Tutorials and they can range wildly in quality. The most important thing, however, is just the sheer amount of material covered. Reading a book a week works when it's Hum10, and you're working with literature. You can understand Frankenstein, mostly, in a week. You cannot understand Hegel in a week. It means that you come out with a very surface level understanding of most thinkers, except for those you choose to write about. Even then, you read so little of their theory that, save three or four thinkers, you feel as though you're not even engaging with them as thinkers. The environment of the course is also incredibly toxic, with just how much pressure they put upon you to concentrate in Social Studies. Every lecture includes 5–10 minutes about why you should concentrate in social studies, and you face actual legitimate pressure to concentrate, which is kind of unacceptable in my opinion. I often legitimately felt ostracized as someone who decided half way through that I wasn't going to concentrate.

At first, I was excited by the idea of a project based course with community engagement. It was awesome to meet organizers who cared so much about niche but super important issues and see why/how their passions manifested through public and justice work. The class has a break about half way through and Flavia even brought pizza a couple of times. BUT the class is just not worth the time and unnecessary stress. There is so little scaffolding for students to know community best practices and have meaningful project ideas that the whole class felt disingenuous. Several groups, mine included, had deliverables that were just connecting their partner organizations to other organizations. However, for the sole purpose of completing the course, it was a long drawn out process of conducting interviews and making things look pretty. Our final presentation thus felt like preaching to the choir. You’re essentially giving a 20 minute lecture to community experts and 20ish students who already probably knew the information because the group projects are pretty similar/have overlap. Towards the end of the semester, everything was just disorganized. The class just became reviews of the professor's research and forced discussions based on questions students had on readings. Among other flaws in the class, some readings are unnecessarily long, we had several challenges being able to see/access materials, and there were several mistakes with assignment descriptions, submission deadlines, etc. on canvas. The feedback is short, vague, and doesn't reflect the grading on assignments/participation. Grades took at least a week to be updated, if at all. I received only 2 grades out of multiple assignments by the time the class ended. The syllabus also gives vague descriptions of the assignment components and it is assumed that you should just know how to complete things to an unrealistic, unspecified standard with no rubric to back anything up. It also doesn't list any concrete information on the expectations in the class on participation, attendance, etc. so if you aren't keen to ask for specifics early, be prepared for a whole rollercoaster of unexpected mess. As a student with both DAO and Title IX accommodations, this class was a nightmare. If you have accommodations, please don’t take this class or do so with extreme caution and keep EVERYTHING in writing. Firstly, the class is in PBHA on the second and third floors with no elevator. When I had mobility issues,  getting zoom access was restricted and an unnecessary deal was made out of moving class to the first floor. Almost every time I asked for help from Flavia or Kamille, but especially Flavia (Kamille often just felt like an enabler/bystander in much of this, which wasn't much more helpful), their condescending tone and poor communication styles made me, and even other DAO/Harvard staff who were witnesses, feel uncomfortable. They were very unaccommodating to physical and mental accessibility needs and quick to shut down conversations on how my accommodations could be met. The irony of the situation was truly unfathomable and traumatic given the supposed intention of the course. Although Flavia preached the importance of listening to people who are experts on their situations and how unethical health practices are harmful–it appears her personal values and teaching style are misaligned. I shared my concerns on several occasions and she was wholly unperturbed. She was incredibly shady in emails and obviously held grudges (even if I owned up to and/or explained something due to disabilities/illnesses). I often DREADED coming to class. The class is small, so everything you do is observed on a microscopic level and that sort of punitive scrutiny can't be productive to anyone's learning experience. Dealing with all these course issues, the staff's poor attitude, and navigating disabilities, was exhausting. I'm worried about repercussions but hoping my honesty will prevent other unassuming students from blindly taking this course. I'm no quitter, so I finished and did my best, but at what cost? For future students, even if you don’t have disabilities or other issues, I would suggest that you take a different course or join a community–based organization and learn through more organic, hands–on experiences. I think Flavia and Kamille are superficially nice, but are deeply flawed and so is the class. Don’t expect the content or name of the course to guarantee that you'll have a good experience or even really learn anything.",0.9827,,0.0,,0.0,,,,,,,,,

My favorite part of the class was section, I had a 9am section and I was excited to go, yeah I know crazy. Rachel is so funny and always makes sections fun and we go over material in an engaging way.

It requires no background knowledge on stats, and although the lectures lowkey don't make sense, the wrap–up sessions are BEYOND helpful (SHOUTOUT JULIE!!) It is important to note that the course recently changed from its usual format, so the exams are no longer take–home (they're all in person), however there are only 2 exams (the midterm and the final) and they are both open note.

Note: be prepared to spend a lot of time on the PSETs. Like a lot. Hahahah.... It'll suck when you're trying to finish it, but you'll honestly be grateful for it in the end because the exams are basically just a shorter version of the PSETS (the PSETS prepare you SO well for the exams).

QRD sucks in general and STAT 100 is not perfect, but Kelly really wants you to do well, and it is SO doable, I promise. It requires no background knowledge on stats, and although the lectures lowkey don't make sense, the wrap–up sessions are BEYOND helpful (SHOUTOUT JULIE!!) It is important to note that the course recently changed from its usual format, so the exams are no longer take–home (they're all in person), however there are only 2 exams (the midterm and the final) and they are both open note. Also, the PSETS hold way more weight than the exams, and there is an opportunity to do a midterm make–up where you basically just correct your answers and can get some points back on the midterm. Slay!As long as you take good notes, have a PSET group (it could literally just be a couple kids in your section whose numbers you have), you'll be totally fine. I personally am not super interested in stats and probably won't be using R ever again after this class, but still, I can say now that I have baseline knowledge on coding which is kind of cool! Note: be prepared to spend a lot of time on the PSETs. Like a lot. Hahahah.... It'll suck when you're trying to finish it, but you'll honestly be grateful for it in the end because the exams are basically just a shorter version of the PSETS (the PSETS prepare you SO well for the exams). Also, once you get the hang of the PSET grind, it becomes so chill. Still annoying, but if you just lock–in and get it done, you'll be chillin. ALSO!! Shoutout Kelly! She is so understandable and so sweet. Her lectures are a tiny bit boring, but it's okay because she's literally such an amazing human and she is so passionate about what she teaches which makes me really happy! And trust me, she KNOWS a lot of us don't know what we are doing, and she is totally okay with that!! Coding is not the easiest thing in the world, and it takes some getting used to! Kelly and the TF's meet OUR needs, instead of the other way around, which is really cool and such an effective way of teaching. When the profs and the students have mutual respect for one another, it makes for a very safe learning environment that you honestly might not find in a lot of other Harvard STEM courses (from what my STEM friends have told me LOL).So ultimately, TAKE STAT 100!",0.9974,"If you have never coded before, this course will be quite brutal,",-0.659,"The best introductory statistics course to take if you aren't already statistically–inclined.

Joe is an amazing lecturer and all the staff for this course are amazing people! Please don't be scared by the reputation of this class; this course really rewards you if you just put in hard work. The course material is also so so interesting. Instead of bashy calculations, Joe tries to make everything work out very nicely (he loves his symmetry arguments), hence less tediousness and more fun! I have learned so much from this class and have enjoyed every minute of it! Just to address some of the common concerns:1. Midterm + Final being too hard: I think if you put in a lot of work (I mean a lot like doing all the practice exams for midterm and final), even if you find the material less intuitive you can still do pretty well on the exams via pattern recognition. This class also has a pretty generous curve to compensate for the difficulty so DON'T BE SCARED! 2. PSETs taking too long + too hard: There are plenty of sections + OH to help guide you through psets. Sections tend to be reviews of the material covered in lectures and techniques for solving problems that are similar to those on the psets. All the TFs are also super patient and willing to help at OH  so don't worry about not having enough support in the class. 3. Statistics boring BOOOOOO: A common misconception (which Joe always addresses at the beginning of STAT110) is that this class is not technically on statistics, rather, it is an introduction to probability (as the name suggests). And, probability is fun. It may be brain scratching at the beginning to think about things such as counting the number of ways to pair people up in a group, but Joe is a great lecturer and tries to help you develop intuition for such problems! All the pset problems are very well written and fun as well! Joe dresses up every year for Halloween too and it was truly one of my highlights of this semester.Some tips on studying for this class:1. Start psets and studying for exams as early as possible: They do take time so please don't introduce unnecessary stress into your life by procrastinating on psets and studying. Some of the problems are really fun to think about as well!2. Study groups: Studying with friends is a great way to motivate each other! It's also great trauma bonding experience to be in the trenches with all your besties.3. Go to section: TFs are AMAZINGGG. Even if you never go to lecture and don't read the textbook, sections will carry you! The TFs put in a lot of work to make times accessible, and since they are all students who have taken the class, they understand what you are going through!4. READ THE TEXTBOOK: Since lectures are only 75 minutes, sometimes Joe cannot go as in depth on certain concepts/proofs/examples. The book goes beyond what's covered in lectures and has so many more examples demonstrating applications of concepts. Reading the textbook definitely helps so much with understanding the material. The book also has neat tricks such as Baye's Billiards that Joe doesn't quite cover in lecture.  TAKE THIS CLASS :)!",0.998,"Anyone who says that this course teaches a lot or shifted the way they think about life is lying. This course is basically pure pain. You will work hard week after week and still come away barely understanding any of the concepts. Read the textbook. Do practice problems. Make this is your hardest course this semester and make sure everything else will be as non–time–consuming as possible.  Practically all of this class is just pattern–matching and doing practice problems is really the only way to get fluent in it. A much as you think you know what you're signing up for, in practice it will be far worse, more difficult, and more time–consuming. Go to section. Go to office hours.

Professor Blitzstein’s lecturing ability was undoubtedly a selling point for the course – even as someone who has done measure theory before I appreciated his exposition of most of the mathematical side of the material. Problem sets were interesting, appropriately challenging and fun to do with other students. Regarding the actual material itself, I will split my review into two halves:1. 'The good stuff'. (Probability and Measure, Representations of Distributions, Expectation and Conditional Expectation, Generating functions, Martingales). I really loved these parts of the course. Learning about these topics answered a lot of unanswered questions I had from 110 in the summer, and simultaneously led me to have very many followup questions (both mathematical and practical) about the material that Prof. Blitzstein and the TFs were great at answering. There are loads of powerful tools here that are really lovelily motivated in lecture and that can be used to approach problems in applied probability much more elegantly than than the approaches one would use in 110. I'm sure this would be mentioned by others as well but I would really like to sing praises especially for Representations and Martingales for helping me build additional dimensions both in my problem solving toolkit and in my appreciation for the beauty of the subject. This might be controversial (especially amongst the maths concentrators), but I personally thought the Measure Theory was done in 210 to an appropriate amount – enough that one understands its role as a ""construction tool"" for many otherwise not–obviously–well–defined objects that we are working with, but not so much that it got tedious or boring (and believe me when I say that I do not want to read through Royden and Fitzpatrick ever again). The one caveat that I might make is to just briefly expand the conditional expectation topic to a more general one on the construction of conditional probability – didn't understand since 110 why conditioning on an event of zero probability made sense and I feel as though myself and many others would have found the idea of how one might do that enlightening. 2. 'The slump' (Multivariate Normal and Asymptotics). Enough said. These parts of the course were terrible and were possibly the worst parts of any course I have taken at Harvard (to be fair I don't think I've had experience with truly terrible classes here). I feel like whilst thinking about how to teach these topics, Prof. Blitzstein didn't feel the need to motivate these as he feels as though we will see plenty of applications in Stat 111, 212, 230 etc. . I completely understand this viewpoint, and especially as a PhD statistics student I could see why learning about these topics would be enlightening, but for me (and a lot of other undergrads who typically take this class) whose exposure to Stat is limited to Stat 110 and 210, I didn't really get to see why these ideas were important at all. This would have been fine if the material was beautiful, but it wasn't – it was ugly, full of bash and uninteresting. Most importantly I did not feel as though these topics were in line with the theme of the class of looking at 110 material from a more elegant and interesting perspective. It really is a shame that I hated these parts of the class so much as I feel as though Prof. Blitzstein could have made these topics a lot more fun and interesting by recognising that these parts of the course are not the most intrinsically beautiful and adapting by motivating this section of the course a lot more via cool applied scenarios like he does for everything else in 110 and 210 (to be fair, I'm possibly beating on a dead horse here because I feel as though I am in the majority of Harvard maths students in the sense that I hated Real Analysis I for its ugliness was so it is probably safe to say I still wouldn't have loved 'the slump' anywhere near as much as 'the good stuff' but it would have definitely helped it go from terrible to at least meh to see it motivated better).Nevertheless, I'm really glad I took this course and I feel like I enjoyed it overall. I am sure that it is miles more interesting than what Graduate Probability Theory would look like at most other universities. Most importantly, it has generated within me a lot of curiosity about the material and has motivated me to want to answer the remaining questions I still have by taking by taking more Statistics classes.",0.9988,"it starts with measure theory. if you came in with good analysis background but bad probability background, don't get too used to slacking",-0.5859,,0.0,111696,Primarily for Graduate Students,Statistics,Statistics,,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,Lecture,Probability I

Lee is a great teacher and his content was very interesting. The papers provided are all fascinating. The teaching staff are very helpful and understanding. There are many interesting individuals taking this course that you get to interact with. In this class 75% of your grade is group work that you will almost undoubtedly feel out of your depth completing; this isn't innately a bad thing, and you learn a lot very quickly, but it induces a lot of grade–related stress. I believe taking this course Pass/Fail is not an option, so make sure you have the space in your schedule to really commit to the process of the group project. Feedback could definitely have been more comprehensive and given at more points throughout the semester. A strong biology background is helpful, but everyone seemed to feel equally out of their depth; this course goes somewhat beyond the theory learned in previous classes. There were times I thought taking this course was the biggest mistake of my time at Harvard, there were times I was very glad to have taken it.

CLASS. EVER. I seriously don't think there is a better class at Harvard. Remo creates such a welcoming and positive space. All the improv and acting activities are so engaging and interesting. Everyone gets the chance to really learn more about themselves when it comes to generating ideas, team work, etc. I love the community this class built, and I will miss it so much! I look forward to this class every week. Writing the blog posts after each class is a great way to reflect on what we have learned. AMAZING CLASS! PLEASE AUDITION IF YOU CAN!",0.9905,"Amazing, life–changing. Best class at Harvard by far, but you have to be willing to fail and make a fool of yourself!",-0.7088,"This is a great class if you're looking for an easy 4th GEM. There is literally no homework at all, except a short response at the end of the week where you briefly talk about your time in class that week. However, if you actually want to learn improv, this maybe isn't the best class. Class was pretty inconsistent with how you'd receive feedback during scene work, which was unfair. For example, asking questions during an improv scene is frowned upon. When guys in our class asked questions during scene work, even if it was necessary for the flow of the scene, they were castigated for doing so immediately, and experienced frequent interruptions in their scene work from Remo. However, when certain girls in our class would make the exact same mistakes, they were not critiqued or interrupted as frequently in their scene work. Why was this the case? Not sure. As a girl, I noticed these differences.It doesn't feel like you really learn anything about improv in this class. You simply play games and exercises for 2 hours, and in the lucky chance that you get to do a scene, you get interrupted constantly by Remo, which makes it extremely difficult to actually learn how to improve. Certain people have certain strengths when it comes to acting, and it didn't feel like we catered to those strengths as much as we could have. There's the famous Einstein quote about how judging a fish by its ability to climb a tree is an inaccurate way to gauge the fish's abilities, and this metaphor could not be applied more to this class. For example, judging one's comfort and ability to dance to Taylor Swift songs in front of everyone is not an accurate way to see how comfortable someone is dancing and how good they are at dancing. Why not switch up the music playlist, and see the differences of how people dance? In this regard The class heavily catered to women like myself, and felt inconsistent with how normal classes at Harvard operate.",0.9766,160654,For Undergraduate and Graduate Students,"Theater, Dance & Media","Theater, Dance & Media",,Arts and Humanities,,Studio,What's so Funny?: Introduction to Improvisational Comedy

Ana is an absolutely amazing instructor, and the TF will definitely also be awesome (Cassie was wonderful!), and they are both very kind people. This course is a tremendous amount of fun, and you will be pushed to move in front of others and connect with yourself and others in ways that you have never before. If Gaga, namely moving in bizarre and vulnerable ways in front of others, sounds really scary, or if you know you wouldn't be interested in such a thing, do not take this course because it is ""easy"". First of all, if you are clearly disengaged because you are ""too cool"" as you look around and don't commit, this will probably be noticed by others and by the teacher and TF, and *gasp* you might not get an A (I don't know how the teacher grades, just a guess that doesn't seem unreasonable). Second of all, forgetting the grade, your lack of effort can affect and bring down the overall vibe, which is just unfair to your peers who are interested in creating a really special, intimate environment where people are happily moving and connecting with one another in a judgement free zone. ASK YOURSELF: Can you envision yourself moving your hips, spine, arms, legs, neck, and face muscles slowly and in different ways as you make eye contact with a stranger? If this sounds terribly unpleasant or **doesn't sound exciting**, in that you don't aspire to be able to do that, I recommend you really ask yourself why you want to take this course and how you reasonably imagine yourself expressing yourself and exploring in an environment where something like that could and will happen.On another note, the founder of Gaga, Ohad Naharin, has been characterized as moving in a ""feminine way"", and there is an intimacy and softness of heart that is integral to large parts of Gaga. If you in no universe can see yourself delicately (or sometimes aggressively) moving your body in ""weird"" or unusual ways, I just don't recommend taking the course. Gaga isn't supposed to turn into a rave (where you move weirdly but in a lost, drunken, out of touch way), but a conscious exploration of our bodies, our movement, and how we connect with these and others around us THAT DOESN'T BREAK DOWN IF EVERYONE STOPS AND STARTS STARING AT YOU (This does happen a few times in groups! Can you dance in the middle of a circle with 30 people? Are you EXCITED to do that and be VULNERABLE in that way!! Reflect –– if you were raving and everyone stopped, you would probably become uncomfortable and lose interest. These are fundamentally different ways of moving with others).I loved this course and encourage others to take it if these things sound interesting. And if one is a bit shy, that's natural of course, and you will get more comfortable throughout the course. But I think the most important question is *Do you want to make yourself deeply vulnerable in front of others?*. If not, don't take this course. If you truly want to make yourself vulnerable and are open to exploring intimacy, take this course. I hope you've found this helpful, and I really encourage you to reflect before signing up.",0.9923,"This course is amazing!!!! I always looked forward to going to class.

The weekly discussions on Canvas were always so interesting already, and continuing them in person with Ju Yon's lecture to guide us really forced me to think deeply about art and identity. She's an amazing professor, she was always happy to meet and discuss, and she gave such helpful feedback on all the assignments. You get such a great mix of students of different backgrounds, both culturally and artistically speaking.

I think there is hope and the course could be much better structured. But what I experienced was subpar. Having a class on this subject is incredibly important, which is why getting it right is important. There were few guided discussion questions and the conversations often led nowhere, stifling engagement with the text. The same people (overwhelmingly graduate students), spoke over and over again, and said few things of substance. The professor did not engage enough with the discussion to encourage critical thinking. Breakout sessions were not effective and wasted time, they had even less direction and would end quickly with students having nothing to say. There was no other structure to the course besides unguided discussion for three hours straight. This kind of experience turns people away from theory and academia and makes it seem like it has no purpose.The course assignments were very unclear. Because few to no requirements nor guidance was given, success in an assignment was nebulous, hard to understand, and hard to achieve. Additionally, because there were only two assignments, it was hard for students to learn from mistakes and improve. We had to  figure out for ourselves what a good paper looked like and what the staff was looking for. By the time we got our first feedback, 40% of our grade was finalized because there was only one other assignment left. Even after going to office hours, how to succeed in the next assignment was unclear. I'm not sure if this is how graduate level courses are intended to be, but since this course included first–years, the assignments did not feel appropriate for learning. Because there were few to none concrete guidelines given for assignments, grades were not assigned based on concrete mistakes or meeting the guidelines given. Even after soliciting more feedback in office hours, the course staff gave no concrete ways to improve in future work. I would encourage students to take other classes in race and gender studies, because they can be incredibly powerful and useful. If this course improves, I would encourage students to take it.",0.9843,,0.0,,0.0,142819,N/A,"Women, Gender & Sexuality","Women, Gender & Sexuality",,Social Sciences,,Seminar,Black Feminist Theory
