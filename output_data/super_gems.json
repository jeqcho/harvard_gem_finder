There is literally no homework at all, except a short response at the end of the week where you briefly talk about your time in class that week. However, if you actually want to learn improv, this maybe isn't the best class. Class was pretty inconsistent with how you'd receive feedback during scene work, which was unfair. For example, asking questions during an improv scene is frowned upon. When guys in our class asked questions during scene work, even if it was necessary for the flow of the scene, they were castigated for doing so immediately, and experienced frequent interruptions in their scene work from Remo. However, when certain girls in our class would make the exact same mistakes, they were not critiqued or interrupted as frequently in their scene work. Why was this the case? Not sure. As a girl, I noticed these differences.It doesn't feel like you really learn anything about improv in this class. You simply play games and exercises for 2 hours, and in the lucky chance that you get to do a scene, you get interrupted constantly by Remo, which makes it extremely difficult to actually learn how to improve. Certain people have certain strengths when it comes to acting, and it didn't feel like we catered to those strengths as much as we could have. There's the famous Einstein quote about how judging a fish by its ability to climb a tree is an inaccurate way to gauge the fish's abilities, and this metaphor could not be applied more to this class. For example, judging one's comfort and ability to dance to Taylor Swift songs in front of everyone is not an accurate way to see how comfortable someone is dancing and how good they are at dancing. Why not switch up the music playlist, and see the differences of how people dance? In this regard The class heavily catered to women like myself, and felt inconsistent with how normal classes at Harvard operate.","workload_score_mean":1.55,"best_gem_comment_short":"This is a great class if you're looking for an easy 4th GEM.","course_id":"160654","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpvf-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=d9dd738f6680cb10c51936db34a2a0b7ceb95fbbddd8132322bb5003293ef2ab2bf685313c8532302d9ddbb1ef46408e&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"ENG-SCI 152","useful_title":"Circuits, Devices, and Transduction","course_score_mean":4.77,"rec_score_mean":4.54,"gem_probability_mean":0.0909090909,"sentiment_score_median":0.8964,"best_gem_comment":"To begin with, to all the EE concentrators, you have probably heard of this course and\/or the iconic Gage Hills, and I assure you the hype is real. Of all the courses in EE I have taken, none has been as effective as ES152 in instilling an intrinsic curiosity and desire to truly understand how things work. This course is very challenging. Be aware that this class is called ES152: Circuits, Devices, and Transduction, which Gage will point out should probably be three separate courses. That means that material which should be covered in three semesters (or more) will be covered in one. It's a big ask, and Gage being as dedicated and passionate about the material as he is, will not skimp or shy away from unturning as many stones as possible in this one semester. Don't be afraid though. It is one hell of a ride. The lectures are always focused on establishing intuition and Gage has an incredible ability and level of patience to explain concepts in a step\u2013by\u2013step way, building on your understanding and connecting sub\u2013concepts into full topics.  The lectures are so entertaining and useful that this is a class where you would never want to miss a lecture. They are very engaging (pun intended) and Gage even spends hours outside of class making MATLAB simulations of MOSFETS and electron orbitals just to help us have a better visual. Homework was split into analyticals and labs. They come as a set, intended to be given once a week\/two weeks. Fair warning, each homework is very long, ranging from 20\u201330hrs on average. However, the homework is full of excellent explanations and guidance, and although you may go pale seeing subparts a\u2013t for a single question, know that by the end of it, you will be amazed by how deeply you understand the concept that question was targeting. Labs were excellent. They covered a good variety of material like audio amplifiers, DACs, and semiconductor devices. Georgios, who I hope will still be a TF for the course, did an incredible job redesigning these labs last year with Gage. Georgios is a gem for the course and has some of the best advice, understanding, and explanations for course material. If he's available in lab or outside of class, he is a wonderful asset to the course and is a great person to discuss questions and concepts with. Speaking of teaching staff, the TFs were truly a dream team. I have never witnessed a course where all the TFs were as all\u2013around excellent as in ES152. Georgios, TomHenry, and Jalil were the Holy Trinity. TomHenry was a wizard at section. I was amazed at how succinct and intuitively he could explain concepts. Interesting to note is that TomHenry has a more traditional background in how he understands the material, meaning his equations match the textbooks. This was a nice juxtaposition to the less traditional way Gage explained material in lecture. Both approaches have their benefits so getting to hear different angles, one in lecture and one in section, really was a powerful combo. Jalil did a great job leading lab and helping us with debugging any issues. Overall, all the TFs were incredibly enthusiastic, capable, and generous with offering time to help us whenever needed.Lastly, as you have probably come to realize in this long response, Gage is an extraordinary professor. I doubt you could find a student who would describe Gage as anything less than exceptional. No matter if it was the beginning of the course, the weekend, some weekday at 3am, in class, after class, whenever and wherever, Gage is always full of energy and passion for teaching. His dedication toward his students is unparalleled, allowing us to slack him any time we had questions (he responds fast) even late at night, and making it easy to schedule one\u2013on\u2013one time with him if we needed help or just wanted to discuss something. The lectures, homework, and even the final exam were custom catered toward the class. I think Gage takes pride in making the homework questions unique yet comprehensive. For example. the final exam took us step by step in creating a display monitor which was so cool, and it was an amazing moment having Gage guide us in proving to ourselves that with the knowledge gained in this course, we could do things that seemed impossible at our level, like designing circuits to make our computer or phone screens. Gage is an excellent teacher but his dedication to getting to know the class and helping us with problems big or small and doing it with such joy made him the best professor I've ever had. Sometimes, we forget that like any professor, he's probably juggling research, meetings, conferences, and his personal life alongside this class, but it was undeniable how much he prioritized this class and every student in the class. This wasn't something he had to do, but he does it because of the person he is and because he understands that teaching and learning is not just about giving lectures and doing the bare minimum. Every student learns at a different pace and in a different way, and Gage made sure we never felt short of having the right support and help however and whenever we needed it. ES152 will be challenging but so fulfilling. Be excited. This class will probably convince you of why you love EE. And finally, just know that you're in excellent hands.","workload_score_mean":15.92,"best_gem_comment_short":"Georgios is a gem for the course and has some of the best advice, understanding, and explanations for course material.","course_id":"207597","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpvf-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=06ee09a5b592b7764707ebd5c9b172260d978c8ac0cdf12fefad9da95eb260d57c8eec9bd2372916015bf27067fc9ab5&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"PSY 1813","useful_title":"Technology and Mental Health","course_score_mean":4.74,"rec_score_mean":4.68,"gem_probability_mean":0.0769230769,"sentiment_score_median":0.9483,"best_gem_comment":"Shifali is a true gem.
