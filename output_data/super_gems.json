It is a true gem in the comparative literature department, as is Professor Lienau! The professor is a brilliant and knowledgeable literary scholar, an incredible resource, and an eloquent educator. I was constantly learning new words in her class. It was inspiring to realize the continuities across regions and to learn about our oft\u2013forgotten history. For example, themes of grief, loss of nation, class distinction, gender roles, etc.. were truly inspiring to me as a literary scholar. It's a true survey class, so the expectations are not too high while the support is generous from the professor. You will learn so so much, and I really enjoyed the work I produced in the class. It was great that we had a diversity of classmates as well, although I must say the most profound observations were made from the professor herself. It's not a must\u2013take class by any means, but a very strong one to add to your schedule, especially if you have a passion for literature and SEA as I do.","workload_score_mean":4.71,"best_gem_comment_short":"It is a true gem in the comparative literature department, as is Professor Lienau!","course_id":"222897","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=218b436bbc946958cb996e99be7d188dac6fb5c75872c717867377f668881dbac41fb182f8014b796e62a4092cba0e8c&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"EXPOS 40","useful_title":"Public Speaking Practicum","course_score_mean":4.92,"rec_score_mean":4.92,"gem_probability_mean":0.125,"sentiment_score_median":0.9126,"best_gem_comment":"Time spent per week2.5, 2, 4, 5, 2.5, 1.5, 2.5, 1.5, 5, 1.5, 8, 1.5, 0, 1There will be three speeches you will give. It is up to you how much you prepare for it.In hindsight, I think I should focus less on the material and on crafting the topic, but instead focusing on delivery and speech techniques. Start practicing the speech instead of keep editing your draft or slides: your end goal is to improve your public speaking anyways!I won't say it is a gem, because you meet 2 hours per class, 2 classes per week, so that is already 4 hours per week (outside of prep time). It might take time to craft the speech, and also there was a week with >100 pages of reading. However, grading is very low stress, so just put in as much as you want to get out of it.A strength of the course is that the class bonds quite tightly, so you get to know a certain selection of Harvard people that perhaps you might not necessarily come across. However, most of them will be seniors, so you might not meet them again. Regardless, it is very cool to get to know them deeply and listen to their speeches. Some speeches are really impressive that you will learn and perhaps incorporate some of their style in your speech. There are also speeches that can broaden your world view. Some are hilarious to sit through.There are some fun warm\u2013up exercises reminiscent of summer camp activities like throwing small sandbags while walking in a circle and shouting out the alphabets. You don't get to do this in most other classes.The idea of our speeches being recorded and we get to privately review them afterwards is also pretty powerful.Take it! It is a fun class that really bonds and also a chance for you to develop your public speaking skills!

There is so much valuable information to grasp from the readings, and the discussions that you get to have with your peers are priceless. Les is such an amazing instructor and is really what made this course a gem. You are essentially given full creative freedom for the final project, and it is such an enriching experience to work under his guidance. Take advantage of office hours because he will open doors to new ways of approaching your idea that you'd never even considered before. The readings are not only interesting, but the load is very manageable as well and it would only take you a couple of hours of focus per week to be able to make the best of class time. If you are a student like me who is also interested in pursuing medicine, I feel that this class was essential to my understanding of how the foundation of medicine was developed, and think that any good doctor should know this history.
