The seminars were super interesting, and I feel like I got a great survey of so many relevant topics\/issues within the science\/technology realms. The topics change a bit based on the year I believe, but some topics included COVID\/vaccines, quantum technology (a major part of Hongkun's work), brain\u2013machine interfaces, and many others. Hongkun was super awesome, which made the class amazing. He had so many cool stories and experiences to share (including with some very interesting people\/politicians\/business leaders) and is very funny, which was a really rewarding aspect of this seminar. We laughed a lot in this class. Also, go to Hongkun's office hours or out to meals (which we did a few times!) to talk about anything that's interesting to you \u2013 he's a great person to talk to. I took this class as a fifth class because I wanted to try a freshman seminar, was interested in the topic, and saw that the q guide was really really good, and I do not regret my decision at all.

I personally am a joint CS and Math concentrator (but am doing an English secondary), so I feel that I can \u201csee both sides of the veil,\u201d if that makes sense. I have a few diffuse thoughts. First, the reading list in this class is absolutely excellent. You read a good dose of the \u201cclassics\u201d (like Woolf, Orwell, and Montaigne), a good dose of \u201cmodern picks\u201d (like Jia Tolentino, Zadie Smith, and some of Prof Wood\u2019s friends that happen to be able to visit class), as well as one book that has rocketed into my all\u2013time favorites (The Periodic Table by Primo Levi). Second, Prof Wood is really quite an amazing lecturer. He has built a career doing \u201cliterary deconstructionism,\u201d and so it\u2019s a treat listening to him break open a piece. I do think the lectures near the end of term fall off, however; he has less to say about some of the packets of modern essays. Finally, a word on this class\u2019s difficulty. It really isn\u2019t a huge time sink, and you can skate by if you want to without doing much reading. However, the beauty of English 185 is that the readings are actually manageable\u2014so you will get so much more intellectual richness out of this class IF YOU READ! Also, the workload outside of reading is fairly light; it\u2019s just 2 essays. However, these are supposed to be good pieces (by the standards of an English concentrator, not by the standards of your gen\u2013ed TF)\u2014and that is a nontrivial task.","best_comment_short":"You read a good dose of the \u201cclassics\u201d (like Woolf, Orwell, and Montaigne), a good dose of \u201cmodern picks\u201d (like Jia Tolentino, Zadie Smith, and some of Prof Wood\u2019s friends that happen to be able to visit class), as well as one book that has rocketed into my all\u2013time favorites (The Periodic Table by Primo Levi).","best_comment_first":"English 185 is a fantastic course for concentrator and non\u2013concentrator alike.","course_id":"207555","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=b891a83c2453782c3fc279163567cb5b58e54b5ebecc4456005d8e547968bada923a70bb0daa1cea3a23f4830e575439&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"EXPOS 40","useful_title":"Public Speaking Practicum","course_score_mean":5.0,"rec_score_mean":5.0,"gem_probability_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.93195,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":3.5,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"TAKE THIS CLASS!

It will certainly challenges your preconceptions about schooling, and as long as you are willing to come in with an open mind, you can take a lot away while engaging in friendly debate. The teaching team and assignments were certainly the highlight of this course for me. The TFs were incredibly passionate about their work and receptive to student feedback, which made my time in the course so much more enjoyable.

It's such a great MMB Seminar. Dr. Silbersweig is very approachable and extremely nice. He teaches us how to look at mental health empathetically and neurologically. He often discusses what the future holds in terms of personalized medicine and questions us about core ideas that society will have to answer when it comes to treating mental health. What forms of medicine are okay? Should treatment be mediated by a Brain\u2013Computer interface? The class also has such a great energy. It's interactive but not in an awkward way and Dr. Silbersweig does a great job at encouraging discussion. The weekly assignments are just summaries of the two of the readings in a meaninful way, and a greater question that the readings made us think about; they were pretty easy, except some weeks the readings were long. Dr. Silberweig was understanding, though, if we couldn't write about all the readings. The final assignment is a 10 page research paper.","best_comment_short":"It's interactive but not in an awkward way and Dr. Silbersweig does a great job at encouraging discussion.","best_comment_first":"I loved this course.","course_id":"160759","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=49a4cd2b80adfaf6b62d48fe68b26666bb644e8de4f88bdff549ecb2a98f9f7f71c6f804703f9ee23594d697bee175bf&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"}]
