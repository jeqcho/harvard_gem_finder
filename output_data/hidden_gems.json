This class was the absolute academic highlight of my freshman fall. Staying two nights at the forest once a month was such a cool and unique experience, and I bonded so much with everyone else in the class. There is a lot being thrown at you on the class days, but is balanced out nicely by how much fun you are having. Dave is an excellent teacher and truly like a father figure to everyone in the class. He makes the experience so special. You also get to have only 3 classes the rest of the month,  since this class doesn't meet regularly, which takes a HUGE load off academically and is a nice way to get adjusted. The homework is minimal. There is reading to do before each weekend. The only submitted work (aside from the final paper) is to submit a short writeup answering a couple questions, due 1 week after each trip. These are very low\u2013stakes, chill assignments that don't take long, and you don't have any submitted homework at all the rest of the month. The final paper was legit but manageable and we had a lot of time to work on it. The forest was absolutely beautiful, the stars were incredible, and it was so cool to get to go around and explore nature \u2013 great way to escape the Cambridge bubble and get outside. The accomodations are truly outstanding as well \u2013 you live in a huge house with tons of beds, tons of space, nice bathrooms and showers, an active kitchen, and tons and tons of free food and drink that is purchased for you to snack on. You really feel like it is your home and you have total free reign to live in the space. You also learn a lot over the course of this class! Getting off campus 1 weekend per month is really not a huge commitment and is honestly really good for you \u2013 I looked forward to those weekends more than anything. It felt like an escape from the stress of Harvard life and into a whole separate world. In conclusion \u2013 this is literally, like, the best class ever conceived. It is such a cool, unique, interactive learning experience that you will never get again in your time at Harvard. You only have one semester where you can try to take it \u2013 don't miss it for the world!","best_comment_short":"The accomodations are truly outstanding as well \u2013 you live in a huge house with tons of beds, tons of space, nice bathrooms and showers, an active kitchen, and tons and tons of free food and drink that is purchased for you to snack on.","best_comment_first":"TAKE THIS SEMINAR, MAKE TAKING IT YOUR FIRST PRIORITY FRESHMAN FALL, YOU WON'T REGRET IT.","course_id":"112349","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpvf-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=2d36dca784554699e9ae5b11760e064ea9fb8c7fd386d12117d61788c30f0d46d17a03ca41b19cf4dfb66881702a3d70&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"OEB 104","useful_title":"The Mouse in Science and Society","course_score_mean":4.8,"rec_score_mean":4.9,"gem_probability_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.8388,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":2.11,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"***TAKE THIS COURSE.

I feel like this class has truly changed me for the better \u2013 both as a public speaker and how I engage with my fellow classmates at Harvard. I came into the class already a relatively confident speaker,  although I had some areas I wanted to work on. From the very first round of speeches, I was absolutely blown away with how much I was already learning. Throughout the course, I learned how to become an evocative story teller, how to engage directly with the audience, speak on the spot, widen the range in both my vocal tone and body language, utilize the physical space on stage, work with slides and\/or props, and weave numerous rhetorical devices into my speeches. At the same time,  each student was given the space to develop their own style, and everybody had at least one outstanding strength that they could share with the rest of the class (from comforting the audience, to projecting their voice, to bringing vulnerability to their speeches, to incorporating humor, and more). Kate and the class always provided helpful feedback that made each one of us a better speaker.  We would do short practice rounds after each speech to incorporate the feedback, and I would often be blown away at how much more impactful people's speeches would become. We also play fun warm up games to start each class (if you've ever done theater\/drama, they're similar to those). They might seem silly at first, but they are in fact really helpful, particularly the improv exercises that prepare you for impromptu speaking. Last note on speaking: I really appreciated the space we were given to experiment with each speech. I never felt like I was ever going to be penalized if something fell flat, and making mistakes and figuring out feels most natural were pivotal in my development as an independent speaker and thinker. I was truly taking the class to LEARN, and I loved every moment of it.The class not only taught me about public speaking, but it also reminded me why I wanted to come to Harvard in the first place. Because Expos 40 is an elective, people from all concentrations take the class. I only knew a couple of other classmates coming into the class, and I am so glad to have met such an interesting and kind group of people. I loved listening to everyone's speeches \u2013 their various perspectives, passions, hopes, fears, and goals. I learned as much from my peers as I did from the structural parts of the course, and I don't think I could have had that with any other class. Come in with an open mind and intention to be an engaged peer, and you will get so much from this course.1000% recommend! Lottery, and lottery again if you need to!

Additionally, he was really generous with the external opportunities he advertised.

I wouldn't have traded Zach for anyone, any other class, no chance. Zach brought this class to life in a way that I truly didn't think was possible. His energy is infectious, he is a fountain of insane and random knowledge, funny quotes and general good vibes. At the same time, he is an excellent public speaking teacher \u2013 I really felt that I have developed a lot as a speaker throughout the class, and it's even more evident in some of my classmates. I was very pleasantly surprised by my improvement, but I was staggered by how much some of the others in the class improved, their first and final speech were night and day, incomparable, it was incredible to see.If this review is ever viewed given the new system, lottery for this class.

It's tough to make a 3 hour class on Friday  evening entertaining, but David does a pretty good job. If you're not used to long classes, though, the lecture can be really brutal.

Professor Cavanaugh makes class extremely interesting, entertaining, and at times, hilarious, making me look forward to class every week. The class is full of amazing FIELD TRIPS and labs while requiring a manageable amount of work that is not burdening. The class book \"Multitudes\" explains topics in such a fascinating way that makes the material engaging, unlike many dull science textbooks.

Lee is a great teacher and his content was very interesting. The papers provided are all fascinating. The teaching staff are very helpful and understanding. There are many interesting individuals taking this course that you get to interact with. In this class 75% of your grade is group work that you will almost undoubtedly feel out of your depth completing; this isn't innately a bad thing, and you learn a lot very quickly, but it induces a lot of grade\u2013related stress. I believe taking this course Pass\/Fail is not an option, so make sure you have the space in your schedule to really commit to the process of the group project. Feedback could definitely have been more comprehensive and given at more points throughout the semester. A strong biology background is helpful, but everyone seemed to feel equally out of their depth; this course goes somewhat beyond the theory learned in previous classes.

Even if you don't have a strong interest in advocating for animal rights or vegetarianism at first, this course will provide you with a great number of perspectives, with your very own helping further this discussion. Furthermore, this course only has two papers versus most other Expos courses having three as there is a capstone project that requires giving a fun pitch on any topic involving animals.
