I'm glad to now have precise terms to describe concepts that I understood intuitively, but could just never name. One of the greatest things in the course that I personally enjoyed was the integration of personal reflection, particularly in the Final Thing. Not only did Professor Ullman give us freedom to do whatever we wanted for the final project, he also frequently made us think about decisions we've made and how its shaped us. I took the Final Thing as an opportunity to reflect on my personal growth and progress, and it was honestly one of the most insightful assignments I've ever had.

This class is great for an easy 5th class, but you get to decide how much you get out of it based on how many times you actually do the reading beforehand. It's a very forgiving workload, and you won't get cold\u2013called or otherwise exposed for not doing the work. But you have a dedicated HBS professor who is ready to teach you, so don't let that go to waste. This is a really fun class to take with friends to get a taste of what HBS is like and feel like you're doing something a little more practical than a pset! You've really got nothing to lose from signing up. And I honestly had a lot of 'intellectual fun' with the assignments, even as someone who came in with a lot of background experience before the class.","best_comment_short":"This is a really fun class to take with friends to get a taste of what HBS is like and feel like you're doing something a little more practical than a pset!","best_comment_first":"Professor Lerner is an endearing, wonderful professor who will generate interest for the subject matter if you go to class.","course_id":"217639","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=ea36301aa315e3a98f26f60de904b1378e1fe2d7d1696399243ef78faac8e8440487537642404e8e1ca5f5c2ad84a61e&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"EXPOS 40","useful_title":"Public Speaking Practicum","course_score_mean":5.0,"rec_score_mean":5.0,"gem_score_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.8692,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":3.23,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Take.

But perhaps most importantly this class was an amazing reprieve from giant lectures where your presence feels meaningless and tiny seminars where you have to clamor against your peers to demonstrate that you did the reading.
