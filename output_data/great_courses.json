I know it can be tempting to take expos classes that have reputations for being \"easy\" expos classes, but I highly encourage you to select a topic that you'll enjoy and that will push you. Taking Ross' Personhood in U.S. Constitutional Law expos was one of the best decisions I made my first\u2013year and I say this with full confidence. Ross is the best and he makes this course what it is. He's simply just an incredible educator. I feel like I had really outstanding teachers in high school,  so it was so amazing getting to connect with a college instructor who I felt cared for me like my high school teachers did. He is genuinely invested in seeing you grow and thrive as a student and this is something that you will come to see and appreciate more clearly as the semester progresses. He will constantly check\u2013in with you and he's always happy to chat with you (one of the highlights of my semester was talking with Ross after our expos section ended). Besides the fact that Ross is just an incredible human and terrific preceptor, the course content is super interesting. A variety of really important Supreme Court cases make up the core of the reading for this class which is really cool. The discussions you'll have in class are nuanced, engaging, and really meaningful. You'll feel closer to all the people in your section because you collectively take on talking about very difficult topics. This is certainly a class that pushes you, but I think that was one of my favorite parts of the course. The rigor never feels arbitrary or unnecessary; it feels deliberate and productive. Ross has spent a lot of time fine\u2013tuning this course and that comes across when you're a student in the course who can see how well\u2013run it is.

It's the best class (not just best CS class) that I've taken in my 4 years at Harvard. KB and Brian are so incredibly kind, encouraging, and supportive of your interests and personal growth. I've never been in a college classroom where I felt more safe and encouraged to fail, learn new things, and try again. I forgot how much my inner child loved learning until I took this class. Never once do you feel like you'll be penalized (with regards to your grade or anything else) if you try something for your project and it doesn't work, and that is something that I never felt before in 16 years of schooling, let alone in college.The assignments are comprised of a term\u2013long project, which can be literally whatever you want it to be (from a board game to a curriculum to an app), and case studies + reflections. All of the case studies are super interesting and somehow always relevant to your project, and each in\u2013class activity for each case study is a little different, so there's never a dull moment. The week\u2013to\u2013week workload is very much up to you. KB and Brian and super understanding that some weeks you make more progress than others. The best part about this class is that there is never any pressure to achieve perfection. The teaching staff genuinely just wants to see you thrive as a person by doing what you're passionate about. Also, there is a SNACK CART in class that KB will refill with snacks you request. KB is an absolute legend. She has so many amazing connections with people in the CS Ed space who actually come into class to provide feedback on your projects! Anyone you ask her to bring into class, she can probably get them to come because she's just an icon. Brian is a tech expert and always provides super useful feedback on your project. All of the people in this class are so, so nice. The teaching staff and this course in general helped me uncover an area that I'm really excited and passionate about.

There is also a 15\u201320 page final research paper, but it's not too bad if you start early. A key thing in this course is to go to the Professors for feedback before assignments are due: they will tell you what you need to fix\/improve, and if you address their feedback you have a very good chance of getting a top grade. Finally, if you are a student with strong religious convictions, I will say that this class takes a materialistic approach to religion, and so there are some interpretations\/portrayals that you will not agree with because of a difference in first principles. That's fine, and you can also register disagreement (politely of course). It's a useful way to think about religious belief and activity, but just keep in mind that how you might see religion is different from how economics sees religion.Actually finally: YOU DO NOT NEED TO BUY THE BOOK.

Essentially, TL;DR if Wes is teaching this class, take it basically no matter what. If he's not, still take the class, but many of these comments might not apply.General (not teaching staff related):Personal academic experience: I came in with 25a and a pretty reasonable analysis background from high school. While this made the class significantly easier, and I definitely spent less time on it than 25a, it was still a difficult course, especially at the very beginning and very end of the semester. I still thus recommend taking 25b, even if you have previous analysis experience. For me specifically, when I took analysis in high school I didn't have a great linear algebra background, and I lost a lot of the intuition and appreciation for the material that I was able to gain in 25b. The course is an incredible deep\u2013dive into real analysis, and you come out of it with a very good understanding of the fundamentals. Notably, if you're thinking of taking 55b, that course doesn't cover real analysis in nearly as much depth\u2013\u2013from what I heard, they spent a week on it. Additionally, at least with Wes, he made sure that we got computational practice and worked with applications quite a bit, so for a non\u2013pure math concentrator I feel like this class might be more useful than 55b.The intensive nature of this class and the small size made the community very strong. While I feel like it was accentuated with our specific teaching staff, I think that this is probably a constant for 25. For 90% of the class, it was basically impossible to complete the problem sets without at least some (and often a lot of) collaboration. You often found at least 12\u201315 people of the 20 person class at Tuesday night office hours. These office hours are some of my favorite memories of my freshman year, not just because of Saint Knut, the CA for those office hours, but also due to the fervent communal energy that would often last late into Wednesday morning. It was a truly collaborative atmosphere\u2013\u2013everyone contributed, and everyone benefited. All of these qualities made the class feel more like a seminar\u2013style class than a classic lecture\u2013based one in terms of the tight\u2013knit community that formed. Adding to the fact that most of us had taken 25a and had known each other since the beginning of freshman year, I can't think of a better class in terms of community. I'm serious: especially for STEM majors, you're not gonna get better than this.Wes:A gem among gems. Potentially the best teacher I've ever had, and definitely the best math lecturer. I assume this applies to any class he teaches, so this almost certainly applies if you're considering taking 19a, 118r, or some other class that he's teaching. His lectures are sometimes transcendental experiences, Picard\u2013Lindelof proof in particular. (I'm not joking\u2013\u2013I was literally dreaming about how beautiful the proof was the night after the lecture.) His enthusiasm for the material, particularly 25b material, is obvious and so infectious. He made the class feel like a journey\u2013\u2013with the Picard\u2013Lindelof proof, for example, he hyped up that proof specifically for weeks before we got to it, and when he finally proved it in class, the way so many of the concepts we had been learning about fit together so perfectly in the proof was just beautiful. He forces us to participate in lectures, and in a very constructive way that, combined with the clarity and deliberateness of his lecturing, made if feel like I could have proved the given proposition or theorem myself if I was given enough time. He also clearly and genuinely cares about his students, hosting numerous office hours and making himself available to schedule individual appointments whenever. His (sometimes intentional, sometimes not) humor also added to the lecture experience. Yes, it's a 9am three days a week, but it was so worth it. Wes does have a few annoying principles that he sticks to very stubbornly: the worst of these is absolutely no flexibility in deadlines (like if you submit something five minutes late you might get a zero). The exams are also in person and quite difficult, although if you study from the problem sets and lecture notes they're usually doable. All in all, the 25 sequence, including 25b, was one of my favorite and most memorable experiences from freshman year. Both 25a and 25b were my favorite classes each semester, due in part to the interesting material, but much more due to the fantastic people in the class, the community and the wonderful teaching we were privileged to experience. I got a little emotional at the end of the final lecture.

If you took Math 55a you are most definitely prepared to take on this class. We also had I think about 4 students from Math 25a and 2 students from Math 22.Based on my experience and other friends\u2019 feedback it feels that Math 55b was a decent bit easier than Math 55a and that in some sense last semester was the \u201creal Math 55 experience.\u201d Last semester we were forced to work together on hard problems for a long time and go to office hours for help, and as a result, we formed a close community and had a deeper understanding of the materials. To some extent this semester we had the continuation of that community but personally, I felt like I understood last semester\u2019s material better and had more interactions with the CAs and just everyone in the class.This course is titled \"Studies in Real and Complex Analysis,\" but on the first day of class, the professor explains to you that in reality, it is more like Math 131+Math113. We roughly had three units: 3.5 weeks on point set topology, 3.5 weeks on algebraic topology, and 5 weeks on complex analysis. As a result, we don\u2019t really dive into real analysis and students should learn this important area of mathematics on their own at some point.We followed Munkres\u2019 Topology through the first two units. In point set topology we learned about fundamental concepts such as product and quotient topology, connectedness, compactness, and separation axioms, which is Munkres chapter 12\u201334. So I would recommend future students who want to do some preparation during winter break to read this portion of Munkres. This part of the course was comparably more intuitive and chill (admittedly compactness is not very intuitive).In algebraic topology, we learned about homotopy equivalences, fundamental groups, Seifert\u2013Van Kampen, covering spaces, and briefly introduced topics like higher homotopy groups and homology. This is roughly Munkres chapters 51\u201357 and 79\u201381. This part of the course was quite difficult for me as it is harder to visualize and see the significance of these constructions. Later on, after learning complex analysis, I was finally able to see some of the motivations and applications of these concepts. Definitely try to go to office hours here, for me at least the problem sets involve a degree of hand waving and many drawings.About a week after spring break we started Complex Analysis, which according to Professor Harris is his favorite and most beautiful part of the course (as usual Joe is an absolutely fantastic and supportive lecturer). Here we followed Ahlfors\u2019 Complex Analysis, which honestly is quite terse and hard to understand (reading lecture notes beforehand helps). We started with holomorphic functions and with the introduction of the Cauchy Integral Formula we were equipped to take on harder problems. After learning about poles, singularities, and Laurent series, we did a good amount of Residue calculus which gave us important results about holomorphic and meromorphic functions.I have to admit, I personally did not find complex analysis to be particularly enlightening as it felt like learning a ton of cool formulas and then just applying them to solve some seemingly arbitrary problems. In retrospect, I actually liked the topology portion of the course better as they introduced new ideas I have never considered before. I will likely take Math 231, a course Professor Harris highly recommended.From my perspective my classmates took the following courses alongside 55b: quite a few took CS 124, a decent amount took Stat 111, some took Math 123 or 129 or 132, and a few took CS 181.Throughout this semester I have been thinking hard on what the point of taking Math 55 is. If a student took courses that taught the materials in 55 separately they may get a deeper understanding by virtue of spending more time on them. I have come to a few humble conclusions: I think by compressing a large amount of abstract mathematics into each semester we do get a slightly more surface\u2013level understanding of individual topics. However, at the same time, we got to see some connections between different areas of mathematics that would be otherwise hard to see, for example, algebra with topology, complex analysis with algebraic topology, abstract algebra with linear algebra; and I\u2019m sure some of the smaller topics we did like the exposure to basic category theory will serve us well in the future. I think I got a very solid overall \u201cfeel\u201d and overview of higher\u2013level mathematics. Moreover, 55 is really at its core about the community. I have met some of my closest friends and some of the most interesting people through this class. The late nights at Math Lounge and Math Library will forever be a sweet piece of memory lying in the foundation of my Harvard journey and I\u2019m sure years later my classmates and I will look back fondly on those days and laugh and shed some tears. I highly recommend anyone reading this to reach out to your classmates, schedule a lunch or a walk together and get to know them better. You will not regret this.Overall I think continuing with 55b was the right choice for me and most of my classmates from 55a. If you are considering this course, sit in on a few lectures and check it out! I wish you the best of luck!","best_comment_short":"Definitely try to go to office hours here, for me at least the problem sets involve a degree of hand waving and many drawings.About a week after spring break we started Complex Analysis, which according to Professor Harris is his favorite and most beautiful part of the course (as usual Joe is an absolutely fantastic and supportive lecturer).","best_comment_first":"Math 55b was an interesting experience.","course_id":"112871","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=457a1684046c241eeaea84daea2cda48fc6f8155cee39c09d3a1de631139e2ca82163a83f36ba95bfb0ce68856c85143&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"CHNSE 106B","useful_title":"Section ","course_score_mean":5.0,"rec_score_mean":5.0,"gem_score_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.8655,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":8.0,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"This class is the most rewarding class I\u2019ve taken.

This is hands down the best class I have ever taken at Harvard out of my entire 6 semesters.

I loved this class. The negotiations were so well organized and built on each other. There are not too many readings which is great because they really let you focus on your negotiation strategy. The writing assignment is a memo where they discourage the academic fluff, which is amazing for applying this to a job. The only downside was that most assignments were due on Fridays 11:59pm which ruined 6 of my Friday nights this semester due to intense procrastination, so please do your Friday assignments on Thursday nights. This class was 60:40 Undergrad: Grad ratio. But the grad students are super nice and are learning just as undergrads are. Do not be afraid to talk up during debates and really take them as an opportunity to work on your debating skills. You will see vast improvements throughout the semester.  There are negotiation debriefs that allow you to think about what you did wrong during the debate and apply this to improve your next debate; take these seriously \u2013\u2013 they help so much.

Personally, I took 123 solely to satisfy the algebra requirement for math joint concentrators, and while I thought some applications of topics (e.g., Galois theory for the unsolvability of the quintic or the norm in quadratic number fields to solve Diophantine equations), I found much of the course content broadly not very interesting. Nonetheless, the content in 123 feels important to know as a math concentrator, and I'm glad that I chose to take 123 to satisfy the algebra requirement. One of the main factors was probably Prof. McMullen, who is a captivating lecturer and makes the content feel tangible (e.g., through geometric explanations of algebraic topics) and clear. His exams were fair (potentially on the easier side if anything), problem sets were really helpful, and the course notes he posts provide some of the best explanations I could find.

Don't be mistaken, this course is definitely an incredible amount of work and normally we were doing about ~80 pages of reading a week, sometimes more, sometimes less but I'd say on average it was about that much. However, with that said, coming into this class, I was not much of a reader but coming out of it, I've genuinely improved my ability to quickly skim and pull out the most important parts from readings (which is a super great skill in my opinion to have). Professor Felter cares so incredibly much about ensuring that you succeed \u2013\u2013 he leaves a large breadth of comments on your assignments that makes it very very clear on how you can improve for your next one. I've never had a professor be so thoughtful and engaging in our comments. He is extremely accessible outside of class, scheduling office hours 1\u2013on\u20131 with you around your schedule and it was wonderful getting to know him. He is a super cool guy overall \u2013\u2013 a lot of amazing stories from when he was a lawyer and through law school. Overall, I think this course is a pretty good introduction to what *might* be expected in a law school class and I think it genuinely helped convince me that I for sure want to go to law school because I was on the fence when I had taken this class about it. Additionally, even though professor Felter cold calls at times, what I appreciated was he never made you feel dumb or stupid or isolated if you didn't know the answer. He genuinely just wants to lead a nice and productive conversation during class and it's a much more enjoyable experience when everyone in the section has done the readings and is able to engage. I'd for sure be ready to put a good ~10 hours into the course each week, at minimum, if you want to get a good grade and really engage with the content. Normally the readings took me around ~4 hours\/week (probably a little more towards the beginning of the semester) to really dig into them and understand them (especially when we had to do our assignments based on the readings) and another good ~6\u20138 hours each week working on the assignments which again, professor Felter spends an incredible amount of time and care with grading them so I'd for sure spend a good amount of time and care in writing them.

As someone with not much econ background (this was my first econ course at Harvard), it was really great learning about econ\/finance concepts through \"history\" (i.e. the 21st century) and real\u2013life events. I would recommend taking this class P\/F because although the class is interesting, the homeworks and exams are not easy and graded pretty strictly.","best_comment_short":"Professor Dynan did an amazing job covering events comprehensively (also added a special lecture on the fall of SVB).","best_comment_first":"This is a really great course in the econ department!","course_id":"207618","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=06c6b5f3b3256df9f55ca1bace932f210ab6969888ff5870c36fdb321ead767000b9ad59019d34327c2abeef38d6a405&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"SLAVIC 97","useful_title":"Section ","course_score_mean":4.67,"rec_score_mean":4.83,"gem_score_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.6784,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":5.5,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Take this course!

I got to win one of the dragons he gave out, as well as a toy robot from one of our class \"intermission\" exercises, both of which I still have and display on my desk. I was always interested in learning how people think, work, and decide, and this course was right up my alley! I'm glad to now have precise terms to describe concepts that I understood intuitively, but could just never name. One of the greatest things in the course that I personally enjoyed was the integration of personal reflection, particularly in the Final Thing. Not only did Professor Ullman give us freedom to do whatever we wanted for the final project, he also frequently made us think about decisions we've made and how its shaped us. I took the Final Thing as an opportunity to reflect on my personal growth and progress, and it was honestly one of the most insightful assignments I've ever had. I've also never had as much creative freedom in a course project, which is kind of sad that Harvard is so heavy on exams or writing assessments.

The kids who had experience interning in finance and investment banking were at a significant advantage. Same with the kids who had taken some other sort of financial economics class. I also think that you would significantly benefit from the class if you were considering an Econ PhD down the road. The class definitely expects that you know a decent amount beforehand, like acronyms of random financial concepts, but you could always look these up or just ask the professor what they are. The class also has no textbook, so if you don't really understand lecture but want to grind the material at home, you'll really only have the lecture slides, which are kind of confusing when not paired with the lecture (and office hours, of course).That being said, if you're somewhat of an outsider to the field, you can still do well \u2013\u2013 just expect an uphill battle and the frequent feeling that everyone somehow knows more than you.

Even if you don't understand everything he says at first, the mere fact that you're hearing  from someone who served on the Fed Board of Governors has a great impact on your thinking in the long run. You'll get great insight into the decisions that policymakers and bankers face, and you'll get great exposure to contrasting economic ideas. Rather than just learning how to compute rote financial metrics,  you'll learn how to critically think about financial concepts and dynamics. I think that the type of thinking Stein teaches is not only valuable for those aiming to be leaders in the world of finance, but for anyone seeking to use analytical skills in decision\u2013making roles.","best_comment_short":"He's a very kind and brilliant professor \u2013\u2013 he memorized all of our first names \u2013\u2013 and this course is one of a kind at Harvard.","best_comment_first":"Can be very helpful to be comfortable with econometrics, otherwise you won't really understand the papers that you are expected to read and critique.","course_id":"156356","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=b4db2c9a93e22b92bf4fe1ea3f6fca2115c9c8827cffadadfdfc9919df4132103991b7088877786297a5086a3f50e7e7&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"ENG-SCI 190","useful_title":"Section ","course_score_mean":4.5,"rec_score_mean":4.44,"gem_score_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.82055,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":5.19,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Very enjoyable, chill experience with a super nice professor who cares a lot about his students.
