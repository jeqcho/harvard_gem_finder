We gave group meeting presentations, annotated spectra, and wrote supporting information for our compounds (like for a paper).

The 10 students this semester really forged strong friendships in this class and this was a powerful experience.Advice: do as much of the work\/assignments in class so you can ask any questions if you are unsure or get stuck. You can leave the lab early and go home, but I usually stayed till the end to finish the assignments and basically not have research work outside of class. Workload is very fair for this class.Side Note: Chem 135 (experimental synthetic organic chemistry) is taught alongside Chem 100r. Chem 135 is a smaller and faster\u2013paced course with more advanced labs, but does not have the science advocacy component (this may change) and also at least in this iteration of the course was less project\u2013based.

Maya Jasanoff is a fantastic professor, incredibly knowledgeable and quite possibly one of the best professors that I've gotten the chance to learn from. She's very passionate about sharing everything she knows. The TAs were all very kind, patient, and helpful as well. The level of detailed feedback we would get on our papers from our assigned TA was ridiculous, I think nearly every sentence had feedback and this is even if you got a solid grade on the paper. In total there were three mini papers and one final paper. It seemed like a big task to complete so many papers at first, but I found the mini\u2013papers to be extremely helpful in the end: each mini\u2013paper helped guide our final paper which was essentially a topic of our choice. Overall I'd recommend this course 100% if you are looking for one of the best HIST sophomore tutorials to take. It won't be an easy class, but I think every HIST sophomore tutorial has very similar workload, so I wouldn't worry about that.

In that vein, she's also very accessible in terms of draft conferences and office hours. Her feedback allowed me to get past the early obstacles in my essay writing, which makes the essay writing process a lot easier overall \u2013 you can spend more time developing your arguments and mapping out your structure, rather than getting stuck on, say, formulating your thesis. Also, Dr. Gold is super lenient with deadlines \u2013 if something is due on Monday at 12am, it's actually due before she wakes up on Tuesday morning, so if you're a night owl, this is really helpful! That being said, I think you could also say that writing essays in this class is a little \"easier\" than in some other classes if you're interested in the topic. Theses are pretty easy to formulate since you're probably well\u2013acquainted with a selection of feminism\u2013related sources and pop culture, so essays can grow from your natural line of reasoning, whereas in more \"obscure\" Expos topics, it might be harder to do that, meaning you might spend more time on your essays.

He engaged us and encouraged debate about the topics we discussed, fostering some of the most intellectually rigorous conversations we have had in our college careers thus far; with his guidance and pointers, we not only better understood the points we were making, but we also understood opposing perspectives too.

My advice is to either (A) make sure the rest of your course load is light or (B) work out an arrangement with your PI where the time commitment is more flexible\/potentially involves remote work to make it more manageable. Now, for the grading of the course. I would absolutely recommend having a conversation with potential PI's you are looking to work with about their expectations for what you need to do to get an A. Also, check in weekly with them about whether or not you are on track (if not, what you can do to get on track). As long as you do this, you should be able to get an A. One last thing, do not overcommit yourself or make promises you cannot keep in order to get an A because that will only backfire. Read here for the assignments. The amazing thing about this course is that outside of what your PI assigns you in lab, there is only one assignment! A final paper describing what you did during the semester that is only 5\u201310 pages long. Make sure you keep track of when this is due because it happens before the reading period (so it can sneak up on you). They don't even require that you have data.

It begins with some basic concepts from stat 210 with some more rigor (e.g., review of conditional expectation and convergence theorems); then, one discusses the Martingale Convergence theorem, uniform integrability, and convergence in L^p spaces. The classic 0\u20131 laws are discussed, with applications, e.g. in LLN or U\u2013statistics; exchangeability is introduced. Some concentration inequalities (azuma, efron\u2013stein) are proven. The first half of the course then ends with the martingale CLT, which is quite a cool result! The second half then begins with a discussion of Brownian Motion (intro, construction, uniqueness, properties), etc. One then moves to Stein's method. Finally, there is a final project, in which one reads a paper (typically somewhat recent research output), and gives a presentation. Overall, the material is quite fun, and there are a lot of cool theorems and proof methods!~ comments ~The course is organized in a very good manner, as to provide both fundamentals and a bit of an idea of the field. Most courses tend to do only one of the two (or neither). However, the basic material (first half and BM) are done fairly rigorously; occasionally measure theory is swept under the rug, but it can be justified with some (and not too great) effort. The book recommendations are very good: Durrett (PTE) is satisfactory for most of the rigor in measure theory (I spent a good amount of time reading details outside of course\u2013time; it also covers some useful concepts not done in 212), Morters\u2013Peres (Brownian Motion) is a good intro to BM and the later chapters (I read a few extras for fun) cover some surprising and cool facts, for instance geometric properties of BM and its relation to random walks); lastly 'Fundamentals on Stein's Method' (cf. arxiv) provides rigor for the Stein's method parts. I find that the very important fundamentals are done quite rigorously and well; some results are introduced to give a sense of what types of results have been proven, and this latter type is usually not justified, but rather intuition (which is good) is provided. The lecturing is fantastic. The usual way I like lectures to go is to either (1) explicate the material in a clear and engaging manner or (2) provide some intuition otherwise not found. These are both done; the first half of the course especially, Morgane encourages participation and engagement by asking questions about how to proceed; following closely in the course was helpful both in understanding the proofs better and being able to come up with and understand the main techniques of proof (e.g., 'definitions!'). Lecturing speed varies; I found that it started quite quickly and then in the end slowed down a bit. As noted in the last paragraph, I think intuition for the unproven results provided was very useful, whereas the basic facts were justified rigorously (and for these, the intuition often comes from going through the basic ideas and really thinking about the math over and over again). The assignments are fairly chill and fun. There are about 5 HW assignments, with one drop; there are a large number of additional problems and HWs which are very useful when studying the exam or for gaining more familiarity with the concepts (so one has enough problems to work with, but there is minimal stress). The final project was a fun way to see what sort of methods and ideas are being researched in probability (e.g., random matrix theory, Stein's method, etc.). Admittedly, it was pretty difficult to comprehend the presentations, but I enjoyed it because one gains a viewpoint of how the course can lead to later research. Now, a few miscellaneous comments \u2014 the exams are not easy, but contain many fun problems. Studying is certainly necessary but the review process is helpful in going through the main ideas of the course, and there are a number of problems and past finals which are enjoyable (there are a lot of 'cute' problems). I would advise one to read the reference materials, both for review purposes, and because they are good classics, which provide a lot of extras (concepts or 'measure theory' etc!) Lastly, Morgane is very approachable outside of class; I went to a few office hours to ask questions, in addition to our final project meeting. She provides helpful wisdom, both in respect to the main concepts of the course as well as life advice, e.g. experiences in grad school, which I appreciate. I came into this semester with a heavy math background and stat 210 deciding that I wanted a change from heavily abstract mathematics to learn more stats \u2014 this course has genuinely built my enjoyment and interest in probability and was important in helping me settle my focus in the field; in this way it has been a very important course for my personal path. It also has provided a satisfyingly large collection of resources for further exploration (e.g., there are the three course references mentioned; a collection of papers from final projects, resources for random matrix theory, etc.). If you are considering this course, definitely take it!","best_comment_short":"The book recommendations are very good: Durrett (PTE) is satisfactory for most of the rigor in measure theory (I spent a good amount of time reading details outside of course\u2013time; it also covers some useful concepts not done in 212), Morters\u2013Peres (Brownian Motion) is a good intro to BM and the later chapters (I read a few extras for fun) cover some surprising and cool facts, for instance geometric properties of BM and its relation to random walks); lastly 'Fundamentals on Stein's Method' (cf.","best_comment_first":"One of the best courses I have ever taken!","course_id":"156452","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=5f11426a05ee082e425805c1abc57ab36017a4401976392eba7ab88554c4a55345d98926d6b3486ee96b4e698ac7bf8f&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"ANTHRO 98B","useful_title":"Junior Tutorial for Thesis Writers in Anthropology","course_score_mean":4.67,"rec_score_mean":4.67,"gem_probability_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.38885,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":4.25,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"If you are required to take this course or are thinking about a thesis, take this course!

Narrowing down at least a topic of study before the semester will allow you to use class to your full benefit and will, in general, make your experience more chill. Second, be aware that the course is quite chill at the beginning of the semester (think 1\u20133 hrs per week) and that towards the end of the semester, once you start drafting, the work spikes a lot (think 8ish hours per week once you start drafting, with potentially many more during reading period. I think I was spending 4\u20135 hrs per day on the essay for the week before it was due). This is kind of unavoidable, but the more seriously you take the drafting assignments the better the last few weeks of the class will be. Finally, don't be too intimidated by this course! 25\u201330 pages is a lot of writing but the course prepares you well for it.

Professor Gates successfully embodied a seriousness about the course material while also being lighthearted and gracious in his approach to students, which made learning in his classroom a complete joy. This is not the style of William through whom weekly assignments are submitted. Professor Gates expressed grace and flexibility in class regarding the occasional delay in weekly responses, yet this was not shared by William who had a seemingly unprovoked outburst one week disproportionate to the offense when an outside commitment meant I was a day late in a response submission. Having never received a prior warning from him before (or any email response from him for that matter) I was taken aback by the tone in which he felt comfortable to speak to a student. It was the sort of exchange that would make me want to drop out of a class had I not been so far along in it, which is sad as prior to the interaction it was my most enjoyable course. Having been a TF myself, I was extremely concerned that any student be spoken to in this manner (as was the director of student support who I showed the email to in order to get advice as to how to handle it, I am writing this at her recommendation). I would like to give the benefit of the doubt as we all have off\u2013weeks, however a few other students and auditors shared similarly uncomfortable exchanges with him which made me want to convey this on the evaluation form in the hope that it might be remedied for future students.

Looking back on the entire year, taking this class was one of my best decisions (and with the lottery to even get in the class, a stroke of luck I am so grateful for).Given that you took LS 50A, I would strongly recommend continuing with LS 50B (look at that application of Bayes' Theorem!). It's really satisfying seeing how the material from the spring builds upon material from the fall \u2013 all the science you learn really *integrates* together. For example, linear algebra is the *basis* for Markov chains which *feeds forward* into neural networks and then suddenly dynamical systems is back to provide a *stable* foundation for models of action potentials. There is so much interesting material in the spring \u2013 I especially enjoyed Markov chains, protein structures, and computational sequence analysis. My one note is that the linear algebra crash course is very fast so it might be helpful to prepare for that. You really won't find another class like this. Not to sound dramatic, but LS 50 has the power to change the way you think and approach problems, and an important part of this comes from having the experience of the entire year. Sure, in LS 50A Bayes' Theorem might just sound like a fancy name for two way probability tables and what even is a prior, but when you actually put it into words and apply it to hypothesis testing in the context of sequence analysis, it suddenly becomes concrete and relevant. who knows, this might become some arrival\u2013esque thing where you start to think of your life in terms of ls50 material \u2013 there's enough of it to go around.LS 50B is a chiller course than LS 50A \u2013 easier psets and exams (and no stat mech) \u2013 and by the spring you'll already have had a whole semester to get accustomed with the idiosyncrasies of LS 50, so that altogether makes for a more relaxing experience. This semester is less about trauma bonding and more about bonding over being in LS 50 together and realizing that time is coming to an end.But obviously, the biggest reason to stick with the course is for the community. The LS 50 community is so special and was a significant part of my freshman year \u2013 and while it's not immediately apparent, the truth is that the class is really instrumental for building and maintaining friendships. Daily meetings, late night psetting, lab karaoke, and post lab Berg meals go a long way toward forging connections and core memories. Also, you get to partake in designing class merch which is so much fun. Truly, through \u2013 the course staff, the CAs, and your classmates are what make the class special. And assuming that you've already taken LS 50A, you already know how kind, available, supportive, and all around amazing the LS 50 course staff is \u2013 all the more reason to stay. If you're still on the fence, I highly recommend speaking to them to figure out what's best for you.I cannot stress enough the value of staying for a second semester of LS 50. The content, the connections, the community \u2013 there's so much to gain from continuing on. And the spring is much less stressful than the fall, so you'll be alright. You'll do great in LS 50Bby any means necessary. \u2764\ufe0f","best_comment_short":"Looking back on the entire year, taking this class was one of my best decisions (and with the lottery to even get in the class, a stroke of luck I am so grateful for).Given that you took LS 50A, I would strongly recommend continuing with LS 50B (look at that application of Bayes' Theorem!).","best_comment_first":"LS 50 is a truly transformative experience.","course_id":"159707","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=73b02b91733ca627c9b2c92819b1407f48d82c95656a75d38d04fc612f3075a8e61f1c5a78038e0ba7c9159ccaa3ea58&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"KOREAN BB","useful_title":"Elementary Korean","course_score_mean":4.57,"rec_score_mean":4.57,"gem_probability_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9161,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":4.86,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Take this class!

I was pretty nervous about expos and was expecting to hate it but this was actually my favorite class this semester.

That means that you talk a lot about biotech and genetics, but in ways that I wasn't talking about those topics in my other bio\/chem courses. The grading was super fair and I actually always enjoyed researching and writing my essays because the topic was so interesting. The final paper itself is also really open to interpretation, you can research anything you want that is in some way related to biotech, genetics, or mortality. I really loved our class discussions, the majority of section time is this so it's very low stress but interesting. Dr. Raymer is also the best!! She gives great feedback and is always willing to stick around after class or schedule a time to talk about any issues you're having with your papers. She's so sweet and was the most accommodating out of any of my professors with sick days. She genuinely really cares about her students and wants to help. There were some weeks with maybe like an hour or two of readings, but they were interesting and you don't have to read them all everytime. This class had a pretty light workload, other than the three weeks a paper was due. I wasn't expecting to get much out of expos in general, but some of the readings really make you think and are super applicable to how you view life, so I actually didn't mind all the readings.

Be ready to study and put in effort though, the class is really not bad in hindsight but it was often overwhelming and stressful knowing you have other exams and work on top of understanding this material.Try on EVERY exam, especially the first. Getting three attempts on a question is better than two or one as you will not always get an easier question on the next attempt or can make a small, correctable mistake that you can try on the next exam.  This happened and often found myself stressed over stars to get a good grade, but everything worked out in the end once I realized how to study for the course and learn the material. The questions are also not easy, there is no partial credit and you will need to get every component 100% correct to get the point which can often seem overwhelming. The concept of stars seemed great, then horrible, but then great once I got the rhythm of efficiently studying. The psets are also designed to challenge you, but make sure you understand them weekly as if not, you will struggle on the exams (like it said in the syllabus). I found myself only completing the psets and not really understanding them which made for applying what I learned so much more difficult.

Make sure to use their office hours effectively as their sessions are the most useful. They are also happy to meet 1 on 1 if you are struggling, which helped me get caught up and get back on track.The labs are heavy coding based, but not bad.

Here are the reasons why:1) Ample study material. The course is accompanied by a very clear and well\u2013written textbook that has been generated specifically for this course over Eli's many years of teaching APMTH 120. This is paired with a DropBox of coding examples for most of the topics you need to be able to replicate (which you should note as a useful resource for homework assignments). You will never need to scour for random resources or PDFs on the internet, as I have for so many previous classes. These materials tell you exactly what you need to know, with clear explanations or examples for each topic.2) Extremely fair quizzes and exams. You will be provided with a clear list of topics to master, as well as access to every past practice exam covering that same material. Eli doesn't believe in surprises on exams (though it would have been good to have a heads\u2013up about the block power method this year...). The TFs are clear and responsive when you request help or need additional clarifications. If you decide to prepare in advance, you have every ability to do well.3) Highly applicable and relevant content. It was rare that we studied a topic that seemed unrelated to direct applications in data science. This is genuinely an applied class.4) Useful and achievable assignments. All the problem sets have clear instructions, as well as ample help available via office hours and Ed. They are almost perfectly tailored for the amount of time that you have available for them and will set you up well for the exams with no unnecessary head\u2013banging.5) Great course staff and a strong support structure. The TFs under Eli are fantastic and responsive. There are a lot of windows for office hours, and they will take time out of their busy weeks to write clear responses to your stupid questions on Ed. They'll even do things like make supplementary materials or videos to explain trickier concepts. You'll never feel lost at sea.6) An awesome professor. Eli is a wonderful guy \u2014 I laughed out loud at least once per lecture \u2014\u00a0and he's the perfect person to teach this class.Don't get me wrong, the course is not necessarily *flexible* \u2014 there's a strict lateness policy, and the homework assignments come like clockwork every week, including spring break \u2014 but it's consistent, realistic, and the course staff will provide all the support in the world for you. I'm a burned out junior in AM who doesn't really feel like taking mind\u2013numbing and\/or poorly organized upper\u2013level technical classes anymore, slogging through random proofs, learning about abstract concepts I don't care about, or spending hours debugging in whatever awful programming language my professor happens to like. Most classes I've taken at Harvard involve at least one of these attributes, typically several, but this class had none of that. It was clear, helpful, and the right degree of challenging, and I feel like the value I got out of the course scaled linearly with every hour of work I put in. I learned a lot of content in spite of myself. I'm really glad I took AM 120 and hope you take it too.","best_comment_short":"They are almost perfectly tailored for the amount of time that you have available for them and will set you up well for the exams with no unnecessary head\u2013banging.5) Great course staff and a strong support structure.","best_comment_first":"This is literally the best STEM class I have taken in my time at Harvard as a junior in applied mathematics.","course_id":"113876","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpv-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=69cb0449bf5d2de2836a92f7cee23ddb4550ec094309943dd998b1f2355df5a94a5ea38c56d076b6b42450fab756894a&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"MATH 157","useful_title":"Mathematics in the World","course_score_mean":4.27,"rec_score_mean":4.19,"gem_probability_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9294,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":7.94,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"Take this class with friends and you'll have the best time.
