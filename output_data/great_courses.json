This has been my favorite class during my first semester. The assignments are fun and are flexible to your interests even though we have specific reading materials to focus on.  The readings in this course were extremely interesting. Each reading assignment was a different court case that we then discussed in class and the discussions were incredibly rich. This class will challenge you and the assignments will take work and effort but the entire process is incredibly rewarding. The comments Ross gives are fantastic. I've used them to guide each of my drafts and final essays. The feedback served as a sounding board for how I was doing, and I internalized those comments. I mentioned at the start of the year that I wanted to know when my essay was quality without the use of a rubric or someone else, and through the comments I've been able to point out issues with my paper on my own now at the end of the semester.The most rewarding to me was our discussion section. The in\u2013class experience was my favorite part of the class. The classroom environment that Ross, my peers, and I created over the semester has been one of my favorite aspects of the Harvard experience so far. I appreciate how supportive and respectful the discussions are and, the student\u2013led aspect of our discussions has led to many personal revelations, closer relationships, and overall understandings across multiple perspectives. On the instructor level, Dr. Ross Martin is genuinely one of the best instructors I've ever had. He is very intentional in what he says and the way he runs his classroom. You can tell that in every action and sentence, he wants the best for his students and the people he interacts with. I needed that in my first semester here. The amount of care and kindness that he has shown to me and the rest of my peers is unmatched. I am so grateful to have been a part of this class and been his student.In terms of preparation, I think it is good to have experience in writing research papers in high school.

For example, when learning some adjectives, good adjectives will be associated with western parenting and bad adjectives associated with asian or chinese parenting, which is quite ridiculous and which uses lots of stereotypes. I personally do not care what a textbook writer thinks of my parents or their parenting (or my future parenting for that matter) but I think some people might find it quite offensive and I think it is just inappropriate in general to treat Chinese culture or Chinese parents in such an unfair and biased way. The textbook also gives the vibe of trying to criticize Chinese culture or the Chinese government whenever there is a chance, which I guess is not surprising because it's America but even as someone who is not the biggest fan of the Chinese government and fully aware of its problems, I still think it is a bit excessive and unnecessary since it is a Chinese class after all, and I find it hard to imagine an English class textbook with criticisms of British\/American culture or the American government whenever possible.","best_comment_short":"Yu and Xiong Laoshi also really cares about the students, and we have fun lots of fun activities like playing games or watching popular\/funny videos in class.","best_comment_first":"As someone who mainly self\u2013studied Chinese before taking this course as my first Chinese class, I would say it is very accessible, the teachers Yu Laoshi and Xiong Laoshi are very nice, and I certainly improved a lot on speaking and listening (which was what I was aiming for since I self\u2013studied mainly through reading, but there are also improvements in writing\/reading for sure).","course_id":"207494","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpvf-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=0bc897917abc5f3a4967f425560b4bc304e0af7e532a0625cabd82e714f5f94ad1d8b039a3e5038184c759250fcd117a&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"EXPOS 10","useful_title":"Introduction to Expository Writing","course_score_mean":4.83,"rec_score_mean":4.67,"gem_probability_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.4404,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":4.83,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"I'm really glad I took this class.

Please take it if you have any interest in race, racism, or the intersection of science and racism. Professor Fuente was an absolutely incredible teacher. From day one, he asked my peers and I questions that were genuinely very difficult to answer despite the answer seeming obvious when he first posed the question. I truly feel as though my conception of race and the history surrounding racism has been challenged thoroughly by this class, and I can confidently say that I think differently about these topics having taken this class. Each class I felt genuinely stumped by some of the questions we were asked to discuss, and it was exciting how discussions didn't just feel like synthesizing information from readings, but as though we were really trying to arrive at some sort of understanding regarding truly complex issues that wasn't yet obvious at the beginning of class. The way I thought about each reading transformed dramatically by the end of our discussions, which made them feel truly worthwhile. In fact, I can confidently say that this course was one of the most academically fulfilling parts of my semester. If you're looking for a class that will truly challenge you and force you to rethink much of how you conceive of concepts like race, this is the class for you. Furthermore, I'd really like to emphasize what a wonderful teacher Professor Fuente is. Each week, we were assigned a brief essay that reflected on the week's readings, and while this assignment wasn't supposed to be anything more than a summary of our thoughts going into the week's discussion, Professor Fuente took the time to leave thoughtful feedback on every single essay we submitted. Whether it was applauding the thinking I had done or pushing me to wrestle with the readings more, I always felt that Professor Fuente truly cared about what I had to say. I felt the same in class, as he truly gave each student the space to speak, even if we were simply posing more questions to the group. He remembered details we shared about ourself on the first day of class and brought them up when relevant throughout the semester, he took interest in our lives outside of school, and, all in all, he made it clear that he cared about our wellbeing which was very comforting being new on campus. As I've already said, he also genuinely challenged us every week, and it made you want to really pay attention to everything he said each discussion. Professor Fuente is also just a really interesting person with some pretty incredible life experiences he shared with us. The two hour seminar period somehow always felt too short!One thing I will say is that if you are simply looking for the easiest freshman seminar option, this class is probably not for you. Readings in this class were long, with full books being assigned for the week's homework sometimes. In addition to that, there was a short essay due reflecting on those readings each week. However, none of those readings ever felt useless. Each class discussion made it very clear WHY we had read a given text or series of texts, and I believe that attempting to cut some of those out would have sacrificed valuable material from the course. Furthermore, the course is structured chronologically, so you really understand the connection between the various texts throughout the semester. Lastly, I cannot express enough what a wonderful experience this class is, and I think that ought to make the greater\u2013than\u2013average freshman seminar workload worth it. It truly is just a great course with a great professor teaching it, and what you take away from Race Science is so worth a couple of reading cram sessions throughout the semester, especially if the rest of your schedule isn't too rough. Please don't avoid this course because of workload if you think you'll be interested in the content. I literally have nothing but good things to say about it. TLDR: Race Science was one of the best parts of my freshman fall, and I am so grateful to have gotten the chance to be Professor Fuente's student. If you are interested at all by the subject matter take the class. It's a great opportunity to have challenging, in\u2013depth discussions in a small\u2013group setting with other students who are similarly passionate about the course content (I loved my classmates in this course!!!!). I'd absolutely recommend giving this course a try, and I'm so happy to have taken it.","best_comment_short":"It's a great opportunity to have challenging, in\u2013depth discussions in a small\u2013group setting with other students who are similarly passionate about the course content (I loved my classmates in this course!!!!).","best_comment_first":"This class is incredible and was one of the highlights of my freshman fall!","course_id":"222107","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpvf-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=14f070c779c180dfe6d8e223dd868280fa3e4d6e3450117a61b354a8402739c84700fb22897300e689eb2be989a5044d&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"MATH 60R","useful_title":"Reading Course for Senior Honors Candidates","course_score_mean":4.75,"rec_score_mean":5.0,"gem_probability_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.0,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":6.67,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"","best_comment_short":"","best_comment_first":"","course_id":"216307","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpvf-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=2c8ff89c072c35a164faa0097b1a76d289efab63c1b2caa88ede90e05019c6b0733b8fe77af29cea19a514ae748b5df0&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"CHNSE BX","useful_title":"Elementary Chinese for Advanced Beginners","course_score_mean":4.75,"rec_score_mean":4.5,"gem_probability_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9178,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":6.31,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"This class is difficult, but completely manageable!

He gives a very comprehensive history of Greece and its very intentional about going against the grain when it comes to accounting for things like foreign influences, which was refreshing. He also makes it all the way through lecture the vast majority of the time, so you never feel like you're missing out. He is very willing to pause lecture and provide further explanations for things or go down rabbit holes if you have a question. Very good with audience participation and is good at soliciting many different voices every lecture. Eli is a very good TF. His feedback on assignments always makes sense and he is very willing to meet with you during office hours to explain anything you don't understand. I once had to miss a lecture and Eli gave me my own personalized lecture during office hours, which made me feel like I missed basically nothing. He also offered to lend me his copy of our textbook more than once. He seems genuinely interested in making sure everyone succeeds in the class. He's great at leading section. My one criticism would be that he is longwinded, so if you're in office hours with somewhere to be, try not to ask too many questions.WORKLOAD (5\/10): Readings are assigned per lecture instead of per week, which really annoyed me. My whole Sunday and Tuesday were taken up just doing the readings for this class. Most of the readings aren't mentioned in lecture or section, and frankly can be skimmed or skipped if you have other work to do. When readings are mentioned in lecture, Dr. Kosmin summarizes whatever is most important about them anyway (either their thesis or how they changed classical scholarship). The textbook we had this semester is very comprehensive, but everything discussed in the textbook will be reiterated in a more comprehensive, synthesized, engaging, and sensical manner in lecture. We are also only ever quizzed\/tested on information from lectures, not the readings, which make them feel especially extraneous. There are weekly quizzes on information from lecture, but every lecture is accompanied by a silly little handout from Eli that literally tells you every thing you need to learn from that lecture that you'll be quizzed on, so you just need to pay enough attention in lecture to note what's important about each item. Literally the most painless weekly quizzes I've ever had. We also have weekly discussion posts that are graded on completion, and Eli makes really fun prompts that always get you thinking harder about the history or scholarship. MIDTERM & FINAL (9\/10): Since there are weekly quizzes, you know exactly what to expect on the midterm and final. There's also a final project\/paper, and the project option is really cool. You get to do stuff with items from the Harvard Art Museums.","best_comment_short":"(Personal context: I'm a History & Classics joint, who has done well in the class so far)OVERALL: 7.5\/10TEACHING STAFF (8.5\/10): Dr. Kosmin's lectures are very engaging and super fun.","best_comment_first":"(Personal context: I'm a History & Classics joint, who has done well in the class so far)OVERALL: 7.5\/10TEACHING STAFF (8.5\/10): Dr. Kosmin's lectures are very engaging and super fun.","course_id":"116729","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpvf-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=701618d9d946bcf1185568cd6d28bf75f79e2283cec7a39e92b52fcafcf17205d4447b62d57fd61eeebae8d82a36aa97&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"EXPOS 20","useful_title":"Expository Writing 20 231","course_score_mean":4.67,"rec_score_mean":4.71,"gem_probability_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9051,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":7.38,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"I LOVE THIS EXPOS CLASS!!!!

There are no sections for this class, as usually only 30 students take it per year, but there are frequent office hours almost everyday of the week, which are really useful\u2013\u2013 Chris, our TF Natalie, and the CAs go above and beyond to make sure you understand the material, and are great for pset help (ask them to check over your proofs!). Chris is very responsive to questions and feedback, so don't be scared to ask questions!Chris is a bit more forgiving in terms of class intensity and (overall) grading than what I've heard about Wes (who had taught 25a prior to this year), but you should still expect to spend a lot of time doing math: psets (one per week, due Wednesday at noon) will likely take at least 10 hours and up to 20. Note that psets will be graded more harshly (but midterm (one) and final grading is bit more charitable). Some further notes if you're in\u2013between 22a, 25a, and 55a:22a provides a mainly computational approach to linear algebra, whereas 25a is much more rigorous and is proof\u2013based. I would say that 25a is more of an extension of 22a, where 25a explores much more of the \"why\" to 22a (you will still need to know how to do computation, however, but is a smaller component of 25a). Meanwhile, 55a is a lot more fast\u2013paced and goes in a bit less depth into linear algebra; you'll spend around two months on linear algebra, and then spend the rest of the time on multilinear algebra (& inner\/outer algebras), category theory, and representation theory. I think generally 55a tends to be a little bit more collaborative in nature, but finding peers to work with during OH for 25a is pretty easy; also I think 25a psets are doable by yourself (might take a bit longer though), whereas 55a psets are not so much.","best_comment_short":"This class can be quite aptly described as \"locally painful,\" but \"globally rewarding\" (Chris).Math 25a is a great class for anyone potentially interested in pure math, and provides a more theoretical approach to linear algebra.","best_comment_first":"This class can be quite aptly described as \"locally painful,\" but \"globally rewarding\" (Chris).Math 25a is a great class for anyone potentially interested in pure math, and provides a more theoretical approach to linear algebra.","course_id":"110808","link":"https:\/\/harvard.bluera.com\/harvard\/rpvf-eng.aspx?lang=eng&redi=1&SelectedIDforPrint=89100c081e5d406e5ff76682354c3c05534d125465c051574a08847e03e2b17e8c7450e48ec868684da85f29a0017c6a&ReportType=2&regl=en-US"},{"course_code":"COMPSCI 73","useful_title":"Code, Data, and Art","course_score_mean":4.65,"rec_score_mean":4.82,"gem_probability_mean":0.0,"sentiment_score_median":0.9655,"best_gem_comment":"","workload_score_mean":8.55,"best_gem_comment_short":"","best_comment":"I loved this class!!!

I have lots to say, but if you don't read all of it, here's my most important point \u2014 more than teaching me math and preparing me for future studies (which it did very, very well), this course made me a smarter person. I can't fully describe it, and indeed it's somewhat uncanny \u2014 but after a semester of working through Math 55 problem sets, I genuinely notice that my mind is much sharper; I think more intelligently about the world (and I honestly didn't think that was possible) far outside of math. What more could I every ask from a course?Math 55 has a reputation. But no, it doesn't take over your life; you can still take other tough classes, be part of some clubs, and have time for your friends (believe me, I did it, and many others alongside me). Don't be fazed by the \"hours per week\" \u2014 it's much more manageable than you think. And yes, it's hard. But that's the best part. It's more than a class. You make so many close friends and find a wonderful community with your classmates, CAs, and the math department as a whole. Think of it this way: The College claims the First\u2013Year Seminar Program is designed to help you integrate into the Harvard academic community \u2014 and that's true, but Math 55 is even better.The hardest part of the course isn't the content. It's the speed and the homework. But Joe Harris is amazing (and I'm sure whoever they assign to teach it in the future will be, too). I truly didn't notice the speed we were moving at \u2014 it always feels like he is moving slowly (in a good way), but he manages to cover so much content in a way that every person in the room understands. I have nothing but praise for him. Oh, and his lecture notes are the best. Side note \u2014 follow Joe Harris wherever he goes in his post\u201355 future. You won't regret it.Now for the best part\u00a0\u2014 the homework. Math 55 problem sets are, well, a rite of passage. Yes, they're harder \u2014 in fact, I'll admit that they're harder than they need to be for you to learn the content. But solving the problems (whether on your own, or, more often than not, with your soon\u2013to\u2013be best friends) and writing up your proofs engages you with the content in a new way unlike any other assignment in any other course. Believe me, the course is the way it is for a reason \u2014 for you to learn, have fun, and make friends. If you like math, take advantage of it while you're here. There is quite literally no better exercise for your brain.You have to live it to know it, but Math 55 is a truly transformational experience unlike any other. In hindsight, I would pick Harvard over any other school just to take this course. There is no better way to start your Harvard journey. And you'll have so, so much fun along the way \u2014 from way too many inside jokes to memorable late nights in the math lounge.

Professor Blitzstein\u2019s lecturing ability was undoubtedly a selling point for the course \u2013 even as someone who has done measure theory before I appreciated his exposition of most of the mathematical side of the material. Problem sets were interesting, appropriately challenging and fun to do with other students. Regarding the actual material itself, I will split my review into two halves:1. 'The good stuff'. (Probability and Measure, Representations of Distributions, Expectation and Conditional Expectation, Generating functions, Martingales). I really loved these parts of the course. Learning about these topics answered a lot of unanswered questions I had from 110 in the summer, and simultaneously led me to have very many followup questions (both mathematical and practical) about the material that Prof. Blitzstein and the TFs were great at answering. There are loads of powerful tools here that are really lovelily motivated in lecture and that can be used to approach problems in applied probability much more elegantly than than the approaches one would use in 110. I'm sure this would be mentioned by others as well but I would really like to sing praises especially for Representations and Martingales for helping me build additional dimensions both in my problem solving toolkit and in my appreciation for the beauty of the subject. This might be controversial (especially amongst the maths concentrators), but I personally thought the Measure Theory was done in 210 to an appropriate amount \u2013 enough that one understands its role as a \"construction tool\" for many otherwise not\u2013obviously\u2013well\u2013defined objects that we are working with, but not so much that it got tedious or boring (and believe me when I say that I do not want to read through Royden and Fitzpatrick ever again). The one caveat that I might make is to just briefly expand the conditional expectation topic to a more general one on the construction of conditional probability \u2013 didn't understand since 110 why conditioning on an event of zero probability made sense and I feel as though myself and many others would have found the idea of how one might do that enlightening. 2. 'The slump' (Multivariate Normal and Asymptotics). Enough said. These parts of the course were terrible and were possibly the worst parts of any course I have taken at Harvard (to be fair I don't think I've had experience with truly terrible classes here). I feel like whilst thinking about how to teach these topics, Prof. Blitzstein didn't feel the need to motivate these as he feels as though we will see plenty of applications in Stat 111, 212, 230 etc. . I completely understand this viewpoint, and especially as a PhD statistics student I could see why learning about these topics would be enlightening, but for me (and a lot of other undergrads who typically take this class) whose exposure to Stat is limited to Stat 110 and 210, I didn't really get to see why these ideas were important at all. This would have been fine if the material was beautiful, but it wasn't \u2013 it was ugly, full of bash and uninteresting. Most importantly I did not feel as though these topics were in line with the theme of the class of looking at 110 material from a more elegant and interesting perspective. It really is a shame that I hated these parts of the class so much as I feel as though Prof. Blitzstein could have made these topics a lot more fun and interesting by recognising that these parts of the course are not the most intrinsically beautiful and adapting by motivating this section of the course a lot more via cool applied scenarios like he does for everything else in 110 and 210 (to be fair, I'm possibly beating on a dead horse here because I feel as though I am in the majority of Harvard maths students in the sense that I hated Real Analysis I for its ugliness was so it is probably safe to say I still wouldn't have loved 'the slump' anywhere near as much as 'the good stuff' but it would have definitely helped it go from terrible to at least meh to see it motivated better).Nevertheless, I'm really glad I took this course and I feel like I enjoyed it overall. I am sure that it is miles more interesting than what Graduate Probability Theory would look like at most other universities.

The first half of the course went rather fine; it sometimes took a while to  fully understand concepts but leading up to the midterm, everything was pretty ok.

He gives positive feedback on your answer even if it's not quite right, and encourages participation for things like examples of English words that have some characteristic, which may feel easier to answer than a question about linguistic theory.I didn't really make friends in this class, but I recommend you do for checking psets over.

I think if you like linguistics as much as I do, which I am guessing you do if you are a concentrator or taking a secondary in it, this class is the bee's knees. Professor Bobaljik is a really good professor. I recommend taking advantage of office hours to get the most out of the class.

TAKE THIS CLASS!! I cannot recommend it highly enough. If you are interested in theory, if you interested in machine learning at all, then this is the class for you. In my honest opinion, this class explores one of the most exciting research fields in math, computer science, and statistics. There is an abundance of empirical phenomena in machine learning\/deep learning that are not well\u2013understood, and the nascent theory to try to explain them is flourishing (most of the papers Prof. Chen discusses are less than 10 years old.)   If you are curious about this extremely new area of theory, then this class gives you the right mental framework, the mathematical tools, the background to think about these problems.  In that regard, this class was a formative experience for me and inspired me to go to graduate school.  Prerequisites: In terms of concrete requirements you should know theoretical linear algebra (Axler suffices) and real analysis. The research field does not use sophisticated techniques beyond this, and Prof. Chen introduces the background knowledge when necessary. The main requirement is strong problem solving skills.  Lectures: The lectures are very fast, as Prof. Chen basically goes through a paper or two every lecture. It is not easy to follow the lectures, but I thought they were extremely fun, challenging, and engaging. Prof. Chen also does a great job at emphasizing the important ideas of a paper and appropriately splits time between derivations and big concepts. Moreover, Prof. Chen does an amazing job connecting the ideas in the class together and forming cohesive themes throughout the semester. You get the sense that this course is building to some larger goals.Problem sets: I really enjoyed working on the problem sets.

The weekly psets are extremely easy, especially if you're a STEM concentrator but even if you're not, and don't take more than 2\u20133 hours a week (you also get 2 drops). You don't need any background besides early high\u2013school level math (logarithms for example). Think stuff like using the compound interest formula, applying that formula in Excel to generate some graphs, some basic probability (you don't need to know this, it's introduced from scratch). Exams are also pretty easy. And yet, I learned SO many useful things about personal finance that I've already started using (think budgeting, opening new bank accounts\/credit card accounts that make me money, understanding how stocks\/bonds\/ETFs\/mutual funds work, figuring out a good investment portfolio, actually investing money).
