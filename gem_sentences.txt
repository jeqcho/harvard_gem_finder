 If you want to take this class as a gem, and not really do the readings I get that, but I really recommend doing them because one, the whole class is discussions about the paper and it is super awkward when your table clearly hasn't read the papers, and two, you actually get a lot out of them and you become a better reader: 0.9493
Great CS gem, lot of yapping but it's fun: 0.7906
 maybe it's just me, but i think everyone complaining about harsh video grading is just having a skill issue ;) take advantage of the first round of video submissions too! also, go to lunch with the course staff—you will learn so much about life skills, not just CS! i was expecting this to be a cheese gem to do a CS class this semester, but actually got so much out of this class, and would wholeheartedly recommend!: 0.4453

  I would definitely not call this class a gem, given the consistent amount of work between labs and the project, the exams, and the need to have a general statistical understanding of concepts (especially in the first half of the course) that aren't common knowledge: 0.4019

EXPOS 40 is a great class and fun to take! But it's not necessarily a gem, since it's 4 hours of class time and also pretty stressful coming up with speeches, practicing them, and giving them on a tight schedule: 0.7871
 Start practicing the speech instead of keep editing your draft or slides: your end goal is to improve your public speaking anyways!I won't say it is a gem, because you meet 2 hours per class, 2 classes per week, so that is already 4 hours per week (outside of prep time): 0.4926
