FASCINATING CLASS def take it even if its not going towards concentration credit if you're remotely interested in history and science (in general, bc topics range from med to nuclear energy to philosophy to instrumentation), the course isn't a gem bc you do have to show up to lecture and pay attention and take notes to do well on midterm/essays/final and there are weekly readings discussed during section, BUT i found the readings super interesting and as a STEM person, it was nice to see a different approach to science: 0.9626
