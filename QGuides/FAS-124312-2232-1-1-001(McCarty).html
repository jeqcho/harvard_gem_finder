The TFs are amazing and they actually know what they are explaining. The PSETs challenge what we learned in class and sometimes involve elements we haven&#x27;t learned but are solvable using what we know. The exams are not terrible (I would say that the difficulty is fair) as long as you study and go prepared.</td>

The lectures are very well structured and organized, and the course flows pretty logically from one topic to another. From my perspective now after taking the course, I believe that I not only learned many common reactions in organic chemistry, but I also learned many fundamental principles underlying organic chemistry that are more broadly applicable. <br/><br/>Do be warned &ndash; this course is very time&ndash;consuming! Between the million practice problems, problem sets, 3 exams, and lab (4 hours every other week + lab reports!), this class is quite the time sink! If you have other demanding classes in your schedule, you will definitely have to carefully manage your time so you can finish your assignments (and eat and sleep). I believe the time commitment is worth it, but you will need to make your decision based on your schedule.<br/><br/>Course logistics&#x2F;advice: in my experience, you learn about 60% of the material needed for psets&#x2F;exams in the lectures, and the other 40% you learn from the Aktiv chemistry problems (quick conceptual quizzes), the practice problem book, and the psets. Although the practice problems are technically optional, it is very very highly recommended to do the problems because there are a few advanced applications or exceptions to the rules you learn in class that are covered in them (which is a little frustrating but since chemistry is very much learned through practice and pattern recognition, it is necessary to do practice problems anyway). Start early on the psets and go to office hours early in the week &ndash; it will save you the stress of being in office hours for hours the day it is due (speaking from personal experience lol). Also, start studying for the exams early and try to stick with Amy&#x27;s study plan as close as you can &ndash; I crammed for the last two midterms did okay, but then I followed her plan more closely for the final and did much better!</td>

So much better organized than what I&#x27;ve heard of comparable classes.<br/>The professor and all TF&#x27;s and section leaders are great, accessible, etc. but just be prepared to put in work especially if this is your first time in orgo. I had previous orgo experience and still found this class to be more in depth, mainly stemming from the creativity present in each pset problem.</td>

Also, Logan and the TFs and PSLs and lab TFs are all amazing; I couldn&#x27;t come up with a more supportive group of people. They&#x27;d guide me through problems in Help Room when I had no clue what was going on, or help me on labs when I was having a hard time getting the reaction to go. <br/><br/>Logan is especially awesome. For example, one time he set a paper towel roll on fire just for fun. <br/><br/>All that being said, please please please make sure you have time in your schedule to spend on this class. The biweekly labs take at least 3 hours and learning the material + doing the Aktiv Chem questions + doing the pset will take a huge chunk of time too. You&#x27;ll also have 3 exams + a final. Although it&#x27;s very very rewarding once you get all the stuff down, actually sitting down and learning the material will feel like being in the trenches.</td>

This year was the last time Logan taught Chem 20, so I&#x27;d make sure to check the syllabus to see if the class structure will remain the same. My experience was that the course&#x27;s organization and support staff are what made it a great learning experience.  <br/><br/> Lectures are fast&ndash;paced, but weekly sections really distill the material to its most important parts. PSets and online practice problems provide ample weekly practice. Labs are interesting, and it&#x27;s exciting to actually run synthesis reactions you learn about in lecture. &quot;Purple book&quot; problems and practice exams provide more than enough opportunities to practice before midterms. Sticking to this schedule will really cement your knowledge and help you retain it throughout the course. This is especially important given how cumulative Organic Chemistry is. <br/><br/>Though there are definitely moments where I felt utterly lost (usually at the start of every PSet or right before a midterm), you learn so much in Chem20 and it&#x27;s a really rewarding experience.

Yes, orgo has a reputation for being a soul&ndash;crushing, weeder course, but Chem20 is quite literally the opposite. I found myself genuinely excited for 9am lecture three times a week. For reference, I went into Chem20 with a strong gen chem background (I didn&#x27;t take LS1A, but I did a lot of chem in high school) and a little familiarity with orgo. This is easily the best organized class I&#x27;ve ever taken. There are hours and hours of help room (chem20 office hours) per week and the teaching staff are incredibly invested in your success. On top of readily available teaching staff, you get nearly 300 pages of practice problems to gain familiarity with course material. This is particularly essential since the most important part of learning orgo is doing practice. Logan makes sure you get that practice! The problem sets are challenging but incredibly manageable (and fun!!). I found that the grading on problem sets can be strict, but it is undeniably fair. The strict grading also ensures that you develop the eye for detail that is so necessary for orgo. Exams are also challenging, but in the best way possible. You will have seen every type of question in the practice exams and practice problems, but you will certainly still have to think. Grading is also very kind in this course, which really allows you to spend time learning and enjoying the material. Chem20 has easily been my favorite class at Harvard, and it&#x27;s made me even more passionate about chemistry. I can not recommend this class more.</td>

If you put in more than the bare minimum to scrape by, you&#x27;re sure to get something out of it still, but obviously I don&#x27;t recommend it. If you do take this, there is a weekly cycle of how work can be spread out that I think you need to establish early on, and when like in week 3&ndash;4 ish (it was unit 3 stuff this year, if the pacing stays same come future years) chemical synthesis and reaction pathway starts looming a) try to do that homework early so you know what you don&#x27;t get, and b) MAKE SURE YOU GET IT. That single bit was the single biggest hurdle for me (and because of poor planning, it also blindsided me) and it&#x27;s the point where the focus of the course shifts dramatically to what ochem really is about, and those (also like me) who don&#x27;t really know what the nature of ochem is before starting need a bit of a mindset&ndash;change to get it.</td>

Going into the class, I thought chemistry was the subject in which I felt most confident of my ability to understand and comprehend material, but I quickly learned success in general chemistry classes does not automatically lead to success in organic chemistry. It is a completely new way of thinking and problem&ndash;solving that takes a while (with a lot of time and effort) to get adjusted to. However, the course is not impossible. There are a ton of resources available to help you succeed, especially Help Room, which is available for a ridiculous number of hours and is where knowledgeable PSL&#x27;s and TF&#x27;s are there to answer questions about the psets and any course material and you can work with other students on the psets. If you put the time in and use the resources available to you, including going to help room, doing practice problems, and attending section, you will be successful. As far as lectures go, they go very fast (personally, I had to rewatch the recordings of some of them to get all of the content), but Logan is an amazing lecturer and has a ton of ways of saying things that help you remember the material. He is also great at thoroughly answering questions mid&ndash;lecture while also staying on track with time. Overall, I would say that this class was the most challenging course I have taken to this point (as a first&ndash;year and potential chem or chem&#x2F;phys concentrator) but also probably the most organized and having the most resources.

This is a hard course, no doubt about it. You have to put in a lot of work, effort, and you have to put in a lot of time studying and practicing outside of just the psets. However, it is the most rewarding course I have taken at Harvard thus far. The teaching staff is incredible. The TFs are amazing and so supportive. Go to office hours and you will get all your questions answered.

If deciding between this course and Chem 17, I would definitely take chem 20. This class is very well organized and well structured, and teaches you a lot while also giving you an understanding of why those things happen. It isn&#x27;t a trivial amount of work &ndash; with 4 hour lab every other week, problem sets, lab reports, studying for each of the 3 midterms, etc. it will probably take around 12 hours a week (at least for someone like me with limited&#x2F;no previous chem experience) but it is definitely manageable and there are office hours for many hours a day every single day of the week.</td>

The 4 hour labs do seem daunting, but most of the time the lab doesn&#x27;t even run that long and it&#x27;s not based on how well you do (trust me I&#x27;ve gotten like a 2% yield sadly) and the lab assistants are really helpful and understanding.

Here is everything you need to know:<br/><br/>First, what should you take, Chem 17 or Chem 20? Chem 20 is definitely a harder course based on looking at the Chem 17 problem sets and exams and talking to many people taking Chem 17. One main difference between the courses is that Chem 20 teaches organic synthesis, which is a pretty challenging skill. For context, most people I know didn’t get a single synthesis problem on the exams fully right until the way end of the semester. That said, once you get the hang of synthesis, it is much more enjoyable than arrow&ndash;pushing mechanisms, which is the focus of Chem 17&#x2F;27. Another major difference is that Chem 20 has lab while Chem 17 does not. The lab was probably my least favorite part of Chem 20 just because it is so long (4 hours at night) and very tedious, but you have to do lab in Chem 27 anyway, so lab should not be a reason to avoid Chem 20. A third major difference is that the problem sets in Chem 17 are pass&#x2F;fail, while the problem sets in Chem 20 are not. That said, there are so many bonus points on problem sets in Chem 20 that you can easily get 100% if you put in the work. Most people I know got 100% in the problem set portion of the grade, so don’t worry about this portion of the course. A fourth major difference is the vibe of the course. The TFs, PSLs, and lead instructor of Chem 20 are way more supportive than in Chem 17 based on what I have heard. Everyone wants you to succeed and will help you as much as you want, which makes a challenging subject like Organic Chemistry much more enjoyable. Fifth, the exams in Chem 20 are apparently much more fair than in Chem 17. Don’t get me wrong, you have to spend a LOT of time studying, but putting in the work will pay off, which is really rewarding. I have not heard the same thing about the Chem 17 exams, which are apparently are intended to trick you. Finally, the grading curve in Chem 20 is slightly better than Chem 17, but both grading curves are not particularly generous. A big difference, though, is that in Chem 20 the grading curve is fixed at the start of the semester, while the Chem 17 grading curve changes depending on how students are doing. As a result, Chem 17 is much more competitive because you are competing against your classmates. Just for reference, in spring 2023, you needed a 90 to get in A in Chem 20 and an 85 to get an A&ndash;.<br/><br/>To succeed in Chem 20, here is my advice. First, stay on top of the content as it is taught. This class moves really fast and it is cumulative, so do the purple book practice problems for each week’s module. YOU WON’T HAVE TIME TO LEARN ALL OF THE REQUIRED MATERIAL THE WEEK BEFORE THE TEST. Each exam is cumulative, so make sure you stay on top of the previous units as well. Second, go to office hours&#x2F;helproom to work on the problem set. While there, really focus not just on the answers but on learning the material. The main factor that determines your grade in chem 20 is the exams, so treat the problem sets as a learning experience, not as required assignments that matter a lot on their own. The TFs are fantastic, so don’t be afraid to ask them questions. Third, start studying for the exams a least a week in advance. Often, you will not realize just how much material has been covered until you sit down and start working through practice problems. The exams are pretty challenging, but for the most part are fair. Make sure to study the stuff you think you are not as good at, even if you don’t think it&#x27;s gonna show up on the test (because it probably will). Fourth, GO TO ALL OF THE LECTURES! Unlike LS1a and other intro classes, the lectures are not required&#x2F;there are no poll questions to assess participation. But, that&#x27;s because the instructors know they don’t need to require people to come since the lectures are useful on their own. If you don’t come to lecture, you will be in big trouble for the exams. Fifth, don’t feel obligated to go to section every week since they are optional. Also, if other TFs are better, just go to their section instead of your own. Use section to help YOU; I often didn’t go and still got an A in the class. Finally, Orgo lab is not fun, but it won’t matter much for your grade, so just try your best and it will be fine, even if it doesn’t feel that way when going through the class. <br/><br/>Good luck!</td>

He is readily available for meetings and explains everything so clearly that you won&#x27;t have any remaining questions. This semester, I gained extensive knowledge in pure synthetic chemistry without constantly stressing about grades (the grading system is very lenient, and there is no curve). The lab component was time&ndash;consuming, but it was absolutely worth it, and the knowledge I acquired is invaluable. Chem20 is incredibly enjoyable due to motivated students who don&#x27;t compete against each other, inspiring TSLs and TFs who are always accessible for assistance and discussions, along with the amazing Professor McCarty.

Even when I was struggling so much, the TFs and PSLs were so understanding and helped me so much.  So overall, this class is hard, but it is worth it. It has such an amazing course staff and I felt so supported while learning chemistry.</td>

While it is really difficult (or at least I found it difficult), it is so rewarding because you learn so much content by the end of the semester. Logan is a great professor and the entire teaching staff has so much knowledge and enthusiasm for the course material. I would highly recommend Chem 20 for anyone interested in organic chemistry!!</td>
