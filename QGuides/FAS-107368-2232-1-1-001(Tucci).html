You have to put so much work in and really show up at office hours, otherwise you will not do well. The tests are difficult, especially towards the later concepts. Labs are fine, just long. Prepare to study a crap ton for the exams, especially because each one covers so much material. They don&#x27;t review for the exams and continue moving forward, so you end up having to look back three or four weeks of past material because they just bulldoze. They also have class during tests, which I find ridiculous. You won&#x27;t be happy with the course, but the final is open note and honestly saved my grade.</td>

You learn a lot of important basic chemistry concepts in a very supportive environment. The teaching staff is great and there is an abundance of resources for all of the content. My biggest recommendation for this class is to make use of the resources that are provided for you. Go to office hours!!!!! Watch the Problem Solving and Review Lectures!!!!! Do the practice problems!!!! Take advantage of the problem sets!!!! They are there for you for a reason. I don&#x27;t consider myself a big lecture learner, and that&#x27;s ok! By using all of the other resources that were provided, I never felt lost on the material. You will be just fine.</td>

This course is an incredible introduction to relevant chemical and physical science concepts in the renewable energy and climate science fields! This course is so interesting, fun, and well&ndash;structured. Exams are very fair, and it is easy to do well in the class if you put in the effort. Try to get Joe as a TF as he is the most helpful, kind and knowledgeable section leader who goes above and beyond for his students. Teaching staff in general is wonderful and very accessible. The course may seem daunting at first,  especially with the sheer amount of information on the Canvas site and in the weekly newsletters, but you learn to filter our what you need to know and get into a routine with problem sets, labs and review videos. My biggest advice would be to go to section and watch the review videos every week.</td>

I don&#x27;t mean just in terms of content and rigor, but in terms of flexibility and pacing. The pacing is quick — you will be covering A LOT of content throughout the semester. The class is also pretty strict with deadlines and attendance, which I thought was a big obstacle to being successful in the class.

Give yourself at least 48 hrs in advance of every exam to do all the practice tests and review every lecture, problem solving review lecture, section material, problem set, and lab, and be as assiduous as possible when putting together your concept sheet (a sheet that you can use during the exam). Don&#x27;t fill it up with random info and focus more on conceptual things or formulas that have confused you or feel counterintuitive. Review your problem set feedback soon after getting it so that you can understand where you&#x27;ve gone wrong to avoid similar mistakes and to check for grading errors. And also! Do all the extra credit opportunities! They do respond to feedback, so it&#x27;s both an opportunity to help improve the course and improve your grade :)</td>

A few things about this course: it is extremely organized and there are many ways you can learn the material (whether it be through lecture, section, the textbook, or the weekly content review lectures). There are also many opportunities to improve one&#x27;s grade. After missing one of the lab days, I was very scared about my grade in the class since the maximum I could get on one of the assignments was a fifty (for missing), but the class allows you multiple ways to drop grades (extra credit assignments throughout the year, which made me feel like I had support in the class). The exams also allow ample amount of time to finish, meaning that you can take your time and enjoy taking the exams. Other opportunities this class provides include things like News of the Week on Fridays and fun opportunities of driving a Tesla. I loved the multiple office hours provided throughout the day for the course (including lab office hours and PSET office hours), especially the office hours that occurred after lecture (Lu explains things extremely clearly); the course staff are absolutely amazing at teaching and care about our success. This course could be very time consuming at times, especially during the third unit (which is like nothing I have ever learned before, revolving around quantum mechanics), but there are so many opportunities to learn and ask questions  (and succeed) that you will be prepared! Additionally, one does not need a strong chemistry background to take this course (the course makes it very clear what one should know the first week of classes and videos to prepare you on these topics).</td>

Lecture&ndash;wise, Physical Sciences 11 is often very hard to understand when Prof. Jim Anderson is teaching. Although he has a very warm and welcoming personality, as a lecturer, he is very boring and often goes onto long, unrelated tangents. Additionally, he is very monotone, which makes it hard to stay concentrated and engaged in class. Although class turns much more engaging when Dr. Gregory Tucci is lecturing, but only takes over for one of the three units, meaning students are stuck with Prof. Jim Anderson for a majority of the semester. However, the Problem Solving &amp; Review Lectures by Dr. Lu Wang are a perfect supplement for the class, presenting all of the content from class in a much easier to understand format. Overall, Physical Sciences 11 is a great class, with a few points of weakness. For any student thinking about taking the class, go for it!</td>

If you have to take this class for a requirement, go for it and don&#x27;t be worried. You will learn a lot, and there are many connections to environmental science and climate change, if that interests you. There is a good bit of busy work &ndash;&ndash; many of the problems you do will be figuring out what equation to use and plugging in numbers. But, the course is well organized with a lot of support, and so this work is not too difficult. Exams are based closely on the problem sets and labs, so if you study those well, you should feel very confident in all 3 midterms. The final exam is take home, which is a big stress reliever when balancing other final exams; it is not too difficult either. That being said, this course is a big time commitment, with 3 lectures, 1 lab about once every 2 weeks, a section every week, and optional problem solving lectures to watch in your own time (which I highly recommend). I didn&#x27;t find most lectures&#x2F;labs&#x2F;sections especially engaging, but even if you struggle to stay focused in class,  you can pick up from reading the notes&#x2F;textbook. Personally, as a biology major, much of the course content was not very applicable to me; I was surprised (maybe my fault for not looking into the syllabus enough!) that it focused so heavily on thermodynamics (think lots of content on enthalpy, entropy, and heat engines!) and electrochemistry, so do think if you are interested in that or not. Overall, though, this course was solid, and if you have to take it you&#x27;ll be just fine. Despite having very little chemistry experience, I found this class reasonable, and as a STEM major I found it much easier to follow than LS1a&#x2F;Ls1b.</td>

I&#x27;ve had Frank Keutch teach a different course, and he&#x27;s a competent instructor, so with him and Greg and Lu, this course will have great instruction overall.

I have to say this is the worst class I have taken so far at Harvard. I think the course staff have forgotten that they are here to serve the students, not the other way around.  The course features endless busy work and feels generally demeaning. The only reason to take this class is to fulfill a concentration requirement; much higher quality education resources that cover the same material are available for free online (look at MIT&#x27;s 3.091 on youtube, Sadoway taught it in 2010 and it was really good). <br/><br/>Comments &#x2F; questions about the class:<br/><br/>&ndash;Why are there 400 students in this class? Doesn&#x27;t that go against basically everything we know about pedagogy? The math department has reasonable class sizes, why can&#x27;t the chemistry department do something similar?<br/><br/>&ndash;There is so much busy work in the problem sets. For example, there are pset questions that literally just ask you to look up an answer from a previous pset.  <br/><br/>&ndash;Similar to the busy work, there are &quot;100 globally relevant questions&quot; distributed though the psets. These questions are focussed on climate change and global energy requirements, and assembling them into a little booklet at the end of the class gets you a PSET drop. While I support the idea of learning about these topics, I have a couple issues with these questions. First of all, they completely gloss over the challenging aspects of the problems they describe to the point that they come across as naive virtue signaling. Second, they are usually only tangentially related to the topic at hand so they are basically just more busy work.<br/><br/>&ndash;Edx problem sets are super frustrating because they mostly test your ability to parse poorly formatted questions. I would say I spend an average of about 1 hour per edx pset, with about 45 minute of that dedicated to parsing the questions and about 15 minute of actual work. The only benefit that I can see of these problems is that they reduce grading workload, which is especially frustrating because 45 minutes of my time is being wasted to save 5&ndash;10 minutes of grading.<br/><br/>&ndash;Students time is treated as disposable. The lab sections provide good examples of this. The lab doors are locked after the lab starts and late students are not admitted.  This would be fine, except that the labs almost always start 10&ndash;15 minutes late, so the entire lab section gets to sit in the hallway from the time the lab was supposed to start until whenever the staff decide to show up. <br/><br/>These are just the first things that come to mind, but I really think the chemistry department needs to come up with something better to replace this class and LPSA. As always, YMMV.</td>

Section was also a great part where I feel like I consolidated the material learned in class. These two components of the class were key to my success and I felt like I learned more here than in lecture. I also loved the format of p&ndash;sets, sections, and exams. They were very straightforward in nature and allowed me to display my knowledge without confusion of what questions were asking from me. All the exam questions are in similar (if not the same format) as p&ndash;sets, sections, practice exams, problem solving &amp; review sessions, so make sure to redo all of them from scratch before the exam and you will be all set! Office hours are great! The labs were relatively easy in my opinion and I always finished within an hour or 1.5 hours max. I definitely recommend this class, especially for pre&ndash;meds.</td>

There will be a new lecturer this upcoming year, we had Jim Anderson and he was a sweetheart, but his lectures were very inefficient and difficult to follow. However, with a good TF, section clears up a LOT. Greg Tucci is a wonderful lecturer and tends to be easier to follow. Make sure to GO TO OFFICE HOURS! there are a ton and they will offer a great space to help you with understanding content and its a great way to cross check your PSET with other students.

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_10ca9716-ce26-45de-b7ba-43f60a99f700">Okay, so most of you are considering this class because you have to take it. So rather than scare you away, I&#x27;ll just try to provide some good advice.<br/><br/>First and foremost, lectures are kind of a mess. BUT this is because they were done mostly by Jim Anderson, who retired! Yippee! Hopefully you get more of Greg and Lu in the future, but regardless, lectures should get a massive boost.<br/><br/>That begs the question: if I can&#x27;t learn from (most) lectures, then how am I supposed to learn? From experience, here are the three best ways to learn in this class, in order of importance: Section, Lu Wang lectures, and problem sets&#x2F;office hours.<br/>Section, as always, is kind of made or broken by your TF. But ultimately, the section notes come in super clutch. The main concepts are always listed right at the top, so even if you don&#x27;t understand things in the moment, you can trust that your section notes will be a super solid reference for studying and completing the problem sets.<br/>Lu Wang lectures are all you need in terms of lectures. Lu essentially manages to stuff a week&#x27;s worth of concepts into an hour and a half of teaching, and it doesn&#x27;t feel very rushed. Props to her, honestly, because these videos do a great job of teaching and basically replaced the need to attend in person lectures. Even if you go to lecture, watch these videos; it&#x27;ll be worth it.<br/>Finally, psets and office hours! Office hours are a regular weekly thing and there is an abundance of good TFs there to help you. Just find a regular time where you can go to OH and find a favorite TF, and go from there. Just stopping by for an hour a week will help you get through the psets so well. This should be the last thing you do each week (before the start of a new week on monday) and it should fill the knowledge holes (if there are any) from section and Lu Wang&#x27;s videos.<br/><br/>Final comment: lab is a buncha hogwash. Just show up on time and go through the motions. Nobody wants to be there, but you have to, so there&#x27;s no use in complaining. The assignments are absurdly easy anyway, so the only bad part about lab is that it&#x27;s an objective waste of time for a big proportion of the class. The results often aren&#x27;t what you&#x27;re supposed to get anyway, so it&#x27;s hard to trust that this component of the class actually teaches anyone anything.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_10ca9716-ce26-45de-b7ba-43f60a99f700">This class is a lot of work, but it is not hard to get a good grade. You will be expected to attend 3 lectures a week, a section, and a lab, in addition to completing 2 problem sets, pre&ndash;lab, and lab assignments each week. Additionally, the lectures were not very effective and most of the time the entire class didn&#x27;t fully understand the course material. However, next year Jim Anderson is retiring, and Gregg&#x27;s lectures were much more helpful than Jim&#x27;s. Even though the class is a big time commitment, it is not super challenging. The problem set and practice exam questions are extremely similar to exam questions, so if you study and understand those questions completely, you should succeed on the exams. I scored a 95+ on all three exams and on most of them, I didn&#x27;t understand the material until a few days before the test. Lu Wang&#x27;s problem solving and review lectures are incredibly helpful and will clarify much of the content&ndash;I would highly recommend watching those every week. Finally, the final is take&ndash;home, which is a blessing. Taking a gen chem course is definitely daunting, but I would say that this course is the best of Harvard&#x27;s general chemistry options, and it is very feasible to do well if you are willing to put the required time&#x2F; work in.</td>

Lots is formula&ndash;based. Support is ABUNDANT. There will never be surprises on exams– as long as you do the practice exams and fill out your study sheet thoughtfully, you should be in very good shape. Don&#x27;t let your guard down after the first part of the course, though! It starts easier, then gets tricky with the acid&ndash;base chemistry, then cools down, then gets a bit tricky again with the orgo&ndash;introduction&ndash;esque stuff at the end! The other tricky section is probably the thermochemistry stuff. But seriously, as long as you go to office hours occasionally when necessary, you should be fine. Oh and a tip– stay in lab even if you finish early– this way you can ask your TF for help on some lab assignment stuff and even possibly finish them during lab section! The lab assignment questions are some of the trickiest among all the assignments, and you should expect to occasionally need help. <br/><br/>Note that there are a lot of revolving assignments, so you&#x27;ll need to closely keep track of deadlines!

Greg Tucci&#x27;s lectures were engaging and made me feel confident in the content that I was learning. Additionally, Lu&#x27;s Problem Solving and Review Lectures also helped me understand any topics that I was still confused about. I would add that you should find a PSET group as early as you can, it makes life easier when trying to understand an approach to a particular problem. Those who take AP chem in Highschool are at a significant advantage in taking this course, but as a student who came from a very weak chemistry background, I still came out with an A. Use your peers as a source, and don&#x27;t be afraid to attend office hours!!!</td>

The midterms and final are great representations of what you learn in the course and if you put in the work, it&#x27;s an easy A because of how well they prepare you for the exams, the resources available, and the forgiving grading scheme. Just make sure you know how to solve all of the problem solving review lecture questions, section questions, and p&ndash;set questions and you&#x27;ll be ready to take the exams. Lu Wang&#x27;s review lectures are GOLD in this course and cover everything you need to know. The lectures for this course can be especially confusing and go on unnecessary tangents and proofs, but her lectures consolidate everything you need to know along with the section handout. The course is very organized, but also unnecessarily bureaucratic and tends to micro&ndash;manage your time. There are so many moving parts and you need to be on top of it to make sure you don&#x27;t miss any deadlines.</td>

Grace Chang, the head TF, is an amazing person and she is there to support you in the course logistically.

There are a lot of resources to help you in this course, like several different office hours and weekly review videos. The instructors are very involved, which I like. The psets and exams are spread out, which is very nice, and the take&ndash;home final is a big bonus when you&#x27;re very stressed studying for your other finals at the end!! I also took Ls1B along with this class, and not gonna lie, there is a high workload with both together, but it&#x27;s doable and will set you up for potential hard classes in the future. Some advice I have is pleaseeee review material you learn that day as soon as possible because by the time a midterm comes around, you&#x27;ll feel so overwhelmed with the amount of material you have to review and practice again. And another thing is it&#x27;s honestly not that hard to do well on the midterms. Reviewing at least 1.5 weeks in advance and redoing the psets, section problems, and&#x2F;or weekly review problems again will set you up for at least a B&#x2F;B+ on the exams. The main thing is consistency and doing a little bit every day. I honestly didn&#x27;t review and practice as much as I wanted to, and I regret it :&#x27;) Despite that, I still managed to do well in the course, but still don&#x27;t make the same mistakes as me!!</td>

Most of the material felt like a review of AP chem, taught in a disjointed order, with a random emphasis on environmental issues that seemed like a waste of time for someone looking for a course on general chem. That said, this is probably the closest Harvard offers to a true general chem class.<br/><br/>For a stem course, it&#x27;s pretty easy, especially if you&#x27;ve taken high school chemistry. The downside here is that there are a lot of hoops to jump through, 3 lectures, section, and lab, much of which feel like a waste of time.  For example, it seems like they could probably condense everything into one lecture a week without much difficulty. <br/><br/>If you&#x27;re looking for an easy gen chem class, this is a good option. You will learn the material, and it shouldn&#x27;t be that stressful. Just don&#x27;t expect the course to be engaging, efficient, or logically structured.</td>

In that case, if you enjoy chemistry, I would consider taking a different chemistry course that might be of more interest (ex: possibly Chem 10 in the fall) or jumping to Chem 20 (organic chemistry—which definitely is not a decision that should be taken lightly, as organic chemistry can be tough if you don&#x27;t already have some experience). Also, I want to note that this class is a bit more bureaucratic&#x2F;micromanage&ndash;y than most college courses, as it is designed for first&ndash;years; it can thus be a bit annoying if you&#x27;re not a first&ndash;year, but the course is fairly well&ndash;taught, and the course staff is great.</td>

If you have a logistical issue, there is always quick help. If you are lost, resources are always available. <br/>The meh: There is a heavier workload due to a lab, lectures 3x weekly, and two problem sets weekly. If you already have one difficult or time intensive course, adding this is doable but certainly a challenge. Labs don&#x27;t feel particularly relevant to the work, in the sense that you could not complete them and have the same knowledge at the end of the course. That being said, most labs did not reach the entire time slot and most ended considerably early. <br/>The bad: The lectures are not always very informative, unfortunately, and I found myself self&ndash;teaching a lot of content or learning content in office hours instead. If you are in STEM, you likely already know that this is the case for a lot of classes here. <br/>If you are taking this course, I highly recommend finding a TF that you like (Joe is amazing) and attending their office hours regularly.
