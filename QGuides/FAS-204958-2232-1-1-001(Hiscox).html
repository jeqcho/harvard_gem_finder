While this course does not have as much work as some other courses at this school might, don&#x27;t just take it for this reason. Take it because the content is cool and rewarding to learn about! It&#x27;s a good course to pair with other courses that require more time to be spent outside of class. I really appreciate how Professor Hiscox has designed this course so that you can learn about a really cool area of government without an unnecessary amount of work.</td>

Grading is a bit ambiguous though &ndash; I still don&#x27;t know anything about how my participation grade will look, and a large chunk of the grading (40% for one presentation, 30% final exam) comes in rather quick succession, so it can be hard to know how you&#x27;re doing.

If you are good at presenting, I would for sure take this course. My TF graded relatively well but was a bit nitpicky. Ensure that you are a great presenter and you could walk out with an A in GOV 1759.<br/><br/>Next, there are two exams — one midterm and one final. These exams were both online, open note, but the Professor had issues with the final remaining online due to new University guidance. Since the exams were open note, they were easier than if in person, due to not having to memorize ample information on the course studies or behavioral concepts. The exams are multiple choice structured, with a few additional short response and long answer questions. <br/><br/>I scored pretty good on the first exam and am waiting for my Final exam score. However, the exams are easy enough if you study a bit. It is integral to know key information about the behavioral concepts and course studies so you are able to answer both the multiple choice and short response questions! I made sure to study for both exams and am happy about my results.<br/><br/>The next portion of your grade is course participation, which constituted discussion board posts (presumably credit &#x2F; no credit) and in person attendance at “sections” which were just watching people’s presentations. I assume that the discussion posts are graded for completion since I got no formal feedback, but my TF contacted some students to do their discussion posts better or to complete ones they didn’t. Since participation is merely showing up to the section and isn’t based on formal engagement in course, I think this will be good for students!<br/><br/>The content of the course is very interesting, too!

Lectures were super engaging and interesting.  Really enjoyed the assignments too &ndash;&ndash; presentation wasn&#x27;t too bad and the discussion posts made sure I was engaging with the class.  Really liked having the midterm and final online and open book &ndash;&ndash; I actually think I learned more that way because I wasn&#x27;t intensely stressed and could actually enjoy what I was learning.  Teaching staff was fantastic!! They clearly have your best interests at heart.  This class was only an elective for me and didn&#x27;t fufill and requirements but I&#x27;d take it again in a heartbeat.  So so interesting.</td>
