This course is disorganised, any lecture that isnt taught by andrew berry is terrible and even the ones he teaches he moves SO quickly. The course moves super quickly not giving us time to actually understand the content, and the PIEs&ndash; wow were they done terribly. They caused a constant source of stress and the practice PIEs we were given were significantly easier compared to the actual PIEs. Would have never taken it if I didnt have to for pre med.</td>

The PIEs are a lot in a short amount of time, so I encourage you to learn the content THOROUGHLY because you won&#x27;t have time to think. That means mastering the PSETs, practice problems, going to office hours, etc. In order to do so, you have to set aside a considerable amount of time for this class.</td>

Yes, his powerpoints are funny and he has cool animations, and he speaks very animatedly overall, but you will learn basically nothing from his lectures. He glosses over important information and spends too much time on useless examples. You will have to teach most topics yourself.<br/>The PIEs are immensely stupid &ndash; 40 minute exams in which you barely have time to read the question, so you just skim and write an answer and hope for the best. On top of this, the practice PIEs are not at all reflective of the actual exam; the practice are generally multiple choice while the exam is all short answer. The PIEs are also really difficult content&ndash;wise, with a lot of topics and question types that have never been covered before.<br/>The organization of this course is bad as well.

The course covers a lot and you will learn a lot from the course, including understanding new areas of biology. The lab section is fun and interesting, especially if your TF is great. Pretty good experience and would definitely recommend if you want to understand bio more. <br/><br/>Some people will say the course is super hard and it definitely takes more work than LS1A but it also covers so much that you will be well prepared for future bio courses. To future students I would strongly recommend this course, but I want the grading team to see what I have to write below so future students can be treated fairer. <br/><br/>Just one thing I dislike: UNFAIR GRADING<br/><br/>Let me tell the story. There was this one question in the exam which required some basic stats and probability (and by basic I mean BASIC not even stat 100 level, not even close to stat 110). And the answer is not the most intuitive but definitely not hard, and I spent some time probably like 5 minutes doing it (the exam was 40 minutes so almost 1&#x2F;8 of the exam), and I got the CORRECT answer which is that the probability is around 75%. Yet they gave me 1.5&#x2F;2.5 because they MISREAD that I said the calculation starts with 5% even though I said LESS THAN 5% which is 3% (I DID mention 3%) and also how would I have got the correct answer if I started wrong?? The grading is just bad. I asked them to fix it and they did NOT until today. <br/>WHAT&#x27;S WORSE: I looked at MORE THAN ONE of my friends&#x27; grades for that question and they got full marks 2.5 points even though they did NOT even come up with a number and they just answered the probability is very small which is the intuitive but WRONG answer (how is 75% small???). <br/>Not that I want my friends to get non&ndash;full scores but it is just a stupid way of grading as writing the probability is small only takes like 30 seconds and is not even correct but if that&#x27;s full points why should I spend around 5 minutes doing the question? <br/><br/>I mean, for that exam I still got over two standard deviations above the mean even with that unfair grade so my complain is not because I am afraid of not getting an A or something, I just hope the grading team will be fairer to future students</td>

The average for the first Pie was in the mid 60s, but there was one average around the low 90s. Most averages were around the mid 70s, but the final grade will be curved.  Also, you&#x27;re allowed to have a one&ndash;sided handwritten cheat sheet for each Pie.

The course materials are kinda cool, flashy, and interesting, but the grading and the overall structure of the course left much to be desired by the end. LS1a was far more interesting and engaging because it presented material in a coherent and earnest manner, but LS1b is a course that&#x27;s painfully blatant about its desire to be a thorn in the ass for pre&ndash;meds (which I&#x27;m not) and dock off points for the most frivolous of reasons.  Many components of this course were obviously intended for no other reason than to give extra grief to students — for PIEs, students could only bring in one&ndash;sided cheat sheets. A sheet of paper has two sides, why not allow both sides to be used? <br/><br/>However, I can say that once you take this course, you do have some pretty sweet access to upper&ndash;level courses which are much chiller and cater more closely to your interests. This semester, I was also enrolled in an advanced&ndash;level MCB course, and to be honest it was far more engaging, interesting, and laid&ndash;back than LS1b. So in the end, I guess you should take this course if you&#x27;re somewhat interested in the life sciences and&#x2F;or if it&#x27;s required. And regarding advice, just read the lecture notes, and watch the parts of lecture that demonstrate how to do more complex exercises (like the different Chi&ndash;square tests and the other quantitative crunching); both tactics combined will give you all the material you need to do the homework and the PIEs.</td>

Most of the PIEs were harder&#x2F;longer than the given practice material and there were barely any office hours before they happen. I&#x27;ve heard they curve down and make the threshold to get an A really high (like 95%+), so it really sucks that making a simple mistake in those 40 minutes can ruin your grade. Also, I disliked how the last few PSETs were combined into a huge 10+ page PSET because it just gave us less time to complete them when they release instead of keeping them as separate PSETS. The biweekly schedule of the PIEs and the PSET in between also took away so much of my time to develop outside of class because one weekend I&#x27;d have to be dedicating to preparing for the PIE and the next I would have to be working on the 10+ page PSET or doing the tedious lab assignment.</td>

No learning pods, no midterms, PIEs are in person, entirely different course staff, just a totally different class. Overall, LS1b is a great course: the lectures are interesting and engaging, the problem sets are fair, there is lots of support (think LOTS of office hours and a very clear structure with practice problems for every lecture and exam), and if you’re a freshman, many of your peers are likely taking this class which makes it easy and fun to make study groups and friends through LS1b! My main caution is that the PIEs (5 40 minute quizzes throughout the semester in place of midterms) are rough. Especially the first PIE &ndash; I’m guessing it’s meant to shock students and make them start studying more, because it is definitely the most difficult. You do get to drop one PIE, which is great. But they are very time limited and can be stressful. I’m guessing&#x2F;hoping the format may change slightly given how frustrated students were with the PIEs this year, so keep an eye out for that. Definitely don’t let this dissuade you from the class— there’s plenty more that makes up your grade, and you’ll learn so much about life sciences. For pre meds — I took LS1b and PS11 together and found the combo was A OK in terms of workload!</td>

The content and relevancy of the material are definitely better than LS1A, but I think it&#x27;s less organized. The lecture notes are essential resources. They are basically the textbook and recap everything that is said during lectures and can be tested on future p&ndash;sets, exams, etc. More importantly, the in&ndash;person PIEs really suck because they are less of an assessment of your understanding of the material and more like Kahoot.

If this is you, I am deeply sorry. If it is not, leave this page and never return–you will be happier for it. <br/>I have avoided taking this course for years hoping, in vain, that perhaps administrators would address the fact that one of the most enrolled classes at this university is consistently and unequivocally despised by students. Evidently, I should have known that Harvard admin had no interest in making their courses worth the exorbitant, offensive price tag. <br/>LS1B is not fun. You likely know this. The lectures are fine, albeit uninspiring. You will have to re&ndash;teach the material to yourself anyway, so attendance isn’t strictly necessary. Labs are useless and, depending on your TF, ridiculously long. The PIEs are frequent and miserable. You are given 40 minutes to complete each exam, which is typically about 8&ndash;9 pages. The exams themselves lack clarity. It isn’t abundantly clear what the question wants from you and the questions aren’t similar enough to problem set or practice questions for you to infer. Naturally, you might assume the course staff is generous with partial credit. You would be incorrect. <br/>Despite the course staff’s insistence that this frequent testing paradigm leads to “decreased stress” since there are no “big” exams, the final is still worth about 25% of your grade. The exams overall are worth 55%. To be blunt: it is not low stress. <br/>On the topic of the final, we were told that the practice exams (23 and 27 pages, respectively) would be as long if not LONGER than the real exam. The real exam, meant to be taken in two and a half hours, was 29 pages. A horrid end to an even more hideous semester. <br/>In summary, there is a reason this is the only class I’ve taken in my college career which needs to preface feedback forms with a request for decency. If you are one of the unlucky students still adding this course to your cart, here is what I recommend: go to OH for problem sets early (they are empty), do the practice problems for each lecture if you have time, complete all practice exams, and pray that you get a generous TF.

The teaching was sub&ndash;par and the exams were dastardly — it seemed as if they wanted you to do poorly. Professor Berry&#x27;s teaching is hit&ndash;or&ndash;miss for different people. He treats the course like a show, which for me, very much does not work for learning. Half of his slides are pictures of peas, or dogs, which isn&#x27;t super helpful. The class is entertaining, I&#x27;ll give him that. But, beyond the entertainment potential, it is SO difficult to learn from his lectures. Pardis, on the other hand, was extremely dry. She spent 40% of lecture throwing tangerines at students who volunteered to answer questions and she SPED through how to solve problems. At one point, she said she didn&#x27;t need to go through the practice problems in much depth... because we&#x27;d have so much experience doing them later (is that not a reason to go through the problem?) In any case, her teaching was very difficult to understand. The PIEs are incredibly frustrating. In order to succeed you need to get all of the content exclusively from the lecture notes (literally EVERYTHING, sparing no details!), because lectures themselves fail to teach you what you need to know. The time allotted to the PIEs is purposefully too little. 40 minutes to complete a 9 to 11 page exam is simply not enough. Most of the mistakes my friends and I made on the exams were just because we didn&#x27;t read the exams closely enough since we were speeding. Andrew and Pardis *claim* they want all students to succeed, but Andrew Berry seemed awfully smug when the class average on the first exam was just about a 65 (and was around  75 for several exams afterwards). The &quot;time crunch&quot; mentality makes it very difficult for students to succeed in this class. Furthermore, lab is FULL of unnecessary busy work. They have you write two papers during the semester, which are almost entirely a waste of time. The poor teaching is just evident how office hours for p&ndash;sets are PACKED with students who don&#x27;t understand the basic information. The teaching staff is also completely variable. Some students have wonderful TFs, while others have TFs who lack expertise in molecular biology or genetics. This class is a real mess and it&#x27;s a shame that it&#x27;s a requirement for so many life science concentrations. In the future, the LS1B teaching staff should consider teaching this introductory class like... a normal class: where lectures aren&#x27;t a show and PIEs fairly represent the material in the lectures.</td>

If you have taken LS1a, the first couple of lectures are refreshers. However, do not let this boost your confidence on how you&#x27;ll do in the class. The PIEs are built for 40 minutes and each is worth 40pts so you have to allocate about 1 minute to each pt on the PIEs. The reality is that these PIEs are more of a test of speed than a test of knowledge. Many students often stated that if they were given more time on these PIEs they would have performed way better than the grade they received. Additionally, the grading team is not generous with partial credit on these PIEs. I highly recommend going through Practice PIE solutions and PSET solutions to see what is expected in your wording for these answers on the PIEs.  This is the first time PIEs are in person (was implemented this academic year to counteract the cheating that occurred online in the previous year) so changes might come (hopefully for the better.  With Andrew Berry also not lecturing, the deliverance of content might also be different. I would say that if you are able to fully understand the PSETs then you can conquer the PIEs, you just need to practice timing. I will say that sometimes it feels that the teaching team is trying to make your life a living hell while taking this course, and it might be true through never seen before questions on PIEs or the time pressure on the PIEs but if you have a strong PSET&#x2F;study group for this course you will be fine.</td>

For example, it will ask you to explain a general concept and then if you do not mention specific things about the application of the concept they will reduce points. Finally, the worst thing about the course, is that the questions are often poorly worded and poorly phrased. On one of the PIEs, they asked an INCORRECT question (the answer is not an answer to the question they asked but to another question).

I thought the organization was off (the PIEs not corresponding to the current lecture material, busy&ndash;work lab assignments, etc.). However, as the course goes on the lab assignments level up, the PIEs begin aligning with the lectures, and it becomes a much smoother course. This course has great resources, &amp; provides everything you as a student might need to be successful (slides, lecture notes, practice problems, practice PIEs,  tutorials on major question types, videos, etc.) PIEs are essentially bi&ndash;weekly quizzes (they make up 55% of your grade). There are 5 normal PIEs, and the final counts as 3 PIEs. The most important part of this class is taking these PIEs seriously. Even if you think you have a good understanding of the material, you need to sit down and study for these PIEs—if you sit down and put in the effort, you will see your performance exponentially improve. Also, you should really try on the PSETS &amp; Lab Assignments because you can get 99% averages on these, and they will help lift your grade &amp; give you cushion if the PIEs are not going as smoothly as you might hope.

When facing challenging questions on the PSETs, the collaborations that happen spark greater learning. The topics covered are generally very interesting and the knowledge will be very useful. The skills gained from LS1B are applicable outside of class and even for extracurricular research labs. I would just beware of the PIEs in LS1B as they can be pretty challenging; make sure to study for the PIEs early in advance and stay engaged with the material throughout so you don&#x27;t end up cramming for the tests.

There is a lot being covered, and lots of resources, but there are also lots of ways they can improve learning. Mid&ndash;semester they ask for suggestions, but they do not put into place the ones that students can really benefit from (and have been saying for semesters). The PIES (the periodic exams for the course) are only given 40 minutes, and they claim that these are low&ndash;stakes and better than heavy midterms, but honestly it just feels like five midterms with the stress. They allow one page of notes but  it doesn&#x27;t help much when everything is fair game, including that one mention from lecture that was not in the review. Once the PIES are done, you will be preparing for finals. To be &quot;supportive&quot; they remove a pset from the week of an exam, and while that is nice, it would be wild to expect students to prepare adequately with given resources and spend hours on a PSET.  Ask your questions, go to office hours because that&#x27;s where a lot of learning happens. Don&#x27;t feel that you are the only one struggling because it is a hard class.  Even though there is always some other assignment to do, make sure to review what you got wrong and understand why and the grading style&ndash; because the rubric is harsh. You don&#x27;t need to sweat everything, but they can add up. LS1b will take up more time than a lot of your other classes, but just go to office hours, figure out who is helpful to you, and make sure you understand content, because question styles will change.

Someone last year said &quot;the PIE model is atrocious and needs to be changed&quot; Well... it changed and now it needs to go back. The tests are 40 minutes, closed book (except for a note sheet). There are WAY too many questions for the 40 minute time limit, and so many little tiny math mistakes are made just because students are struggling to meet the time limit. This isn&#x27;t a person to person thing, not a single person was leaving these exams early &ndash; everyone was pushed to the last minute. This shouldn&#x27;t be the case, especially in college and for a test that gives questions in a way that we&#x27;ve never seen before. If the exam was algorithmic&#x2F;memorization, that would be one thing, but the PIEs asked questions in ways we&#x27;ve never seen before which causes even more confusion for such a fast test. <br/><br/><br/>ANYWAYS. the content of the course was actually pretty interesting, but it was very hard to become invested due to the constant work flow and feeling like we&#x27;ve never actually covered what we need to in section and PSETs until it shows up on the PIE and we&#x27;ve never seen it before. Section was pretty brutal too, there was no standardization of section whatsoever so if you have a TF who isn&#x27;t a good teacher you&#x27;re screwed. Lab protocols were very confusing and often contained mistakes that course staff had to send out updated versions of, which messed up the lab even more. The course also ends up basically like computational biology, which was unexpected. It gets very mathy at the end and much less conceptual.</td>

The issue about the PIEs is the time crunch and the level of difficulty of some questions, like instead of asking about the main topics we practiced&#x2F;covered, they&#x27;ll ask about a detail from the lecture notes. There were a few times where I studied so much for the PIE, but I still ended up not doing that great. :( The grading on the PIEs and sometimes psets can also be harsh. I also took ps11 along with this class, and not gonna lie, there is a high workload with both together, but it&#x27;s doable and will set you up for potential hard classes in the future. Some advice I have is look over the lecture notes and low down videos and do the practice problems!!! The lecture notes might be a little overwhelming at first, but it has the all the information you need to know on there. The low down videos are a great way to understand the main concepts, especially if you&#x27;re a visual learner like me. The practice problems tend to be a little bit more difficult than the level of questions you&#x27;re expected to answer, but they&#x27;re still a good way of solidifying your understanding and applying your knowledge. Just don&#x27;t get too discouraged if you&#x27;re confused by them. Lastly, the final wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it would be, so there&#x27;s some hope there. This course may seem daunting, but just try your best!! Make sure to find a pset&#x2F;study group and just use each other as emotional support through the course haha you&#x27;ll get through it just like hundreds of other students did!!</td>

If the number of PSET&#x27;s are to be lowered like we had it this year, you&#x27;ll have to grind out one week for a PIE and another week for a 16 page PSET.  The lectures are usually not helpful and there&#x27;s so much information needed to be mastered every week. If you&#x27;re taking PS11 as well, I will say that you will have LS1B PIE&#x27;s and PS11 midterms on the same day&#x2F;week. Most people take both PS11 and LS1B yet it&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s cared about by the teaching staff. If you take this course, get a tutor immediately and stay on top of your studying.

That means every lecture slide, every relevant practice problem; every relevant practice PIE, low down videos, PSETs, section packets, and post lecture notes. All of these provide new information and question types that you must know. You should also try to predict how practice problems could be changed to trick students on PIEs. For example if all the practice problems give you information &quot;A&quot; before information &quot;B&quot; assume that the PIE will try to trick you by giving information &quot;B&quot; before information &quot;A.&quot; Meet with&#x2F;email your TF often to check your understanding of course material.

P&ndash;sets proved manageable towards the end of the semester, but that was only after they cut out quite a few.

There are LOTS of exams like every two weeks but they&#x27;re really short, which I loved, because I stayed on top of the content and couldn&#x27;t procrastinate. <br/><br/>Also, if you have prior wet&ndash;lab research experience, it&#x27;ll make the beginning of this class a lot easier, IMO. Nothing too intense even, but just having a knowledge of basic techniques like cloning, PCR, etc. is really helpful. I was doing a lot of things in the lab that this class taught me the actual theory behind, so that was cool! <br/><br/>I never felt a shortage of support in the class! Overall I really liked it and the things with the exams were, for the most part, an equal disadvantage. This is a weird qualm but chattiness in the class was kind of an issue. I&#x27;d recommend sitting closer to the front because it could get really loud in the back, especially when Prof. Sabeti, Preceptor Boselli, or Maria were lecturing. I thought they did a great job, with highly&ndash;effective lectures, but 1) some of their lectures were, to me, slightly less interesting content and 2) they&#x27;re less silly and hyped&ndash;up than Prof. Berry is, so people&#x27;s attention wavered a lot, and it was really distracting. It was pretty frustrating to see this degree of inattentiveness in this institution. <br/><br/>TLDR; sit near the front if you&#x27;re even mildly sensitive to full&ndash;blown conversations and TikToks playing out loud right next to you, non&ndash;stop, the full lecture. It&#x27;s genuinely a problem.</td>

It can be frustrating and you need to understand and retain more than you think you will from lectures in order to succeed in psets and pies, but it’s well worth it and you’ll come away being very well versed and comfortable in a pretty wide range of biological topics with a lot of depth.

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_2993a279-0fb2-4a24-b7ec-7a5b68c55329">If you&#x27;re looking at this class, then odds are that it&#x27;s either a concentration requirement or a prerequisite for something else like the premed track. Here&#x27;s the rundown, but be aware that the class is going to be taught by a different professor next year so I don&#x27;t know how much of this will still apply.<br/><br/>Lectures: Decent to good, it really depends on the lecturer so it may be different, but they weren&#x27;t bad. Dr. Berry and Dr. Sabeti each had their styles of lecturing that were both more engaging than just sitting in a hall listening to someone talk for an hour, which was nice. They put up these questions which you just had to answer for attendance, but other than that, they&#x27;re a good way to get the general idea of what you&#x27;re going to be learning in any given week, with some examples sprinkled in. Pay attention to the examples that they give, a fair amount of this class is (kinda surprisingly) based in some math and statistics, so seeing problems being worked through will come in handy on the PIEs(more on those later).<br/><br/>Lecture notes: There are these notes published weekly alongside the lecture slides, READ THEM. Go through, take notes, make sure you understand everything in the lecture NOTES. Anything in there is fair game, and sometimes there are details that aren&#x27;t in the slides, so if you want to do well, use them. Heck, you could probably get through the class on those alone, as long as you also make sure you know how to do some simple stats calculations. <br/>Lab: So once a week, you go into a lab room, do an experiment or part of an experiment, clean up, fill out some info for a lab report, and repeat. That part&#x27;s pretty fun if you&#x27;re into biology, what sometimes sucked is when we had a multi&ndash;week experiment where something went wrong in the beginning and we had to use sample data for the whole thing, but yeah. If you&#x27;re coming from ls1a, be warned that there are also a few lab papers you&#x27;ll have to write throughout the semester, where you have to find scientific articles and then do a write&ndash;up on a specific gene or bacteria. It&#x27;s very formulaic, they tell you what to include though, so it&#x27;s not hard just time&ndash;consuming.<br/><br/>Exams: Good news, ls1b doesn&#x27;t have midterms. Bad news, it has these things called PIEs instead. Instead of 1&ndash;2 midterms, you have 5 min&ndash;exams that are 40 minutes each, and you get to drop the lowest one. I&#x27;m not sure what they were like in past years, but coming from someone who did pretty well on them, they did NOT calibrate the difficulty correctly. Half the class barely passed the first one, and they weren&#x27;t much better moving forward. You&#x27;re expected to write way too much for the time they give you, and any short&ndash;response question is graded on whether you include 1 or 2 specific details about the question topic, so you end up just writing everything you know in the box and hoping for the best. They let you take a single page of notes into each one too, but there isn&#x27;t time to really use it, and some questions are oddly specific so you still have to write mostly everything on it in order to answer those questions. Be prepared if you&#x27;re going to take this class. The final exam was pretty fair though, so credit where credit is due.<br/><br/>Homework: Classic PSET course, not much different from ls1a&#x27;s PSETs if you did those. Get a weekly document, answer questions, go to office hours, work with other people, etc. Definitely get a good PSET group together if you&#x27;re not already planning on taking this class with other people you know. Halfway through the semester, they reduced the number of PSETs, but that just meant they took half of the remaining PSETs and merged them with the other half, so each one was twice as long instead. In terms of difficulty, very hit or miss, some would be pretty straightforward and then others would take hours to figure out.<br/><br/>So...yeah, that&#x27;s about it. The content was actually pretty interesting, there&#x27;s even a little bit of disease genetics and virology if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re into (I was, which made it fun), and overall it wasn&#x27;t bad &ndash; though, having friends also taking it and being able to study together and all that definitely helped. <br/>And if you&#x27;ve gotta take this class for premed, then godspeed to ya.</td>

I would actually recommend doing practice problems instead of going to review lectures because those will just be a course head lecturing you the entire time.
