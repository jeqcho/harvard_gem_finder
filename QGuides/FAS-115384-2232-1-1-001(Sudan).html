I think a lot of the criticism for 124 stems from the discrepancy between the satisfaction from the learning experience vs. the workload. It is well&ndash;known that CS 124 has a higher workload compared to other class, and unlike some other classes, this workload does not teach you much. The Psets usually have not very meaningful questions and meant for tedious practice. Interestingly, the programming assignments were the most interesting part of the course, and I think the staff should put more emphasis on those. For instance, instead of having 5 proof problems a pset, they can have 3 proof, and 1 programming problem. This way, CS students actually get practice with implementing the algorithms, and actually understanding them better. Otherwise, problems are simply finding tricks, which is not very meaningful.<br/><br/>What left me unsatisfied is that this course took the most time out of all of my classes, yet, I don&#x27;t feel like I learned much.</td>

You should ask multiple students if you hear otherwise in order to get a more complete picture. This class also requires a lot of extra time to complete the problem sets. I would describe the class as having a full time job so I suggest making sure your other classes do not require as much of commitment. This class needs to be your priority if you want to succeed.  The lectures are also difficult to understand the first time and I suggest rewatching if at any point you are confused. Go to section as well since the tfs reinforce the concepts and help go through problems. Overall, I would look at an alternative to this class since I feel there are better options with less of a time commitment that teach more relevant skills for future careers. The problem sets are proof heavy and I wish the curriculum involved coding up more of the solutions since I feel I know how to do something on paper but coding is a different story.</td>

It will be very tempting to skip lecture because all the lectures are recorded and then posted, but I recommend that you go to lecture and stay up to date with material. If you digest the topics as soon as they are taught, it makes the next lecture so much easier. Once you start falling behind, you get into a deep hole because of how much the course builds upon itself.<br/><br/>In terms of preparation for this course, I think any math class 22 or above will have you well prepared for this class. This was the first real CS course I took (besides CS50 in the fall). If you&#x27;ve done competition math before and could confidently score above 7 on the AIME, this class will be interesting enough yet not impossible, and I highly encourage you to take it. Overall, while the course is very difficult, I think that if you have decent mathematical preparation (mostly competition math), then you should definitely make the jump and take this course.</td>

It is definitely among the most difficult courses I have taken, both in terms of the kind of material taught and the amount of time that has to be put in to learn it well and do psets.  Definitely find a strong pset group, as this makes a huge difference in how much you learn from the course and how enjoyable an experience you will have (I had so much fun collaborating with my pset group, brainstorming together was really enjoyable, and it felt like we were solving logic puzzles together).  Exams are extremely hard, as they are about as hard as pset questions, in which you are expected to be able to problem solve, but by yourself.  While having a good grasp of the conceptual is important, I would emphasize making sure to practice problem solving throughout the course, as this is something that takes a lot of time and effort to become adept at, and what the course is really trying to teach you.  I am walking away from this class having learned so much, as this course teaches you so many strategies for coming up with efficient and effective algorithms to solve so many types of computational problems.

Would highly recommend making an honest effort to struggle through them, instead of getting answers from OH or other students.

Sections also got the same treatment. Thanks Emin (TF) for the recordings!<br/><br/>Total time: 154:32:47 Hours. <br/><br/>Review: <br/>This was, understandably, by far my hardest class. I averaged to about 45 hours of work per week in total for all of my academic work this semester. 34% of the time was spent on this class alone. So, do keep in mind that you will have to spend a LOT of time on the class. You HAVE to manage your time well. Do not make the same mistake as me and take 5 classes during your CS124 semester. It was a stressful semester to say the least. I recommend taking as many easy classes to go with this class so you have more time for this class. <br/><br/>I would also not recommend taking this class freshman year if you do not believe in yourself a lot. Remember, I didn&#x27;t have any of Stat 110, CS61, cs120, cs20, etc. This will act as a multiplier on how difficult the class is. Do NOT try to prove yourself through this class as this class will defeat you. You being at Harvard or you being one of the most clever students even within the Harvard cohort doesn&#x27;t mean anything for this class. You will struggle a lot. Get used to it. Psychologically preparing yourself for the incoming doom is important for having a healthy experience with this class as having high expectations will actually cause you more harm than good. <br/><br/>For assignments, make EXTENSIVE use of Office hours and make sure to attend at least two per week. I would not recommend going to class if you are not already in the SEC for something else. Watch at 2x speed and learn more. Definitely watch and digest MIT 6.042 and 6.006 before taking this class if you can since they will help a lot. If you are at a level where you are good with CS, do not waste your time by taking cs20 and watch MIT 6.042 instead.  The Median for all pset assignments was around 118&#x2F;124. This should give you an idea of how good the other students are. Do not take the class for granted and be as perfectionist as you can be. <br/><br/>Your grade will ultimately be determined by the two exams. This is because Office hours make Psets and Progsets essentially easy. The median for the second progset, for example, was an astounding 100&#x2F;100. The median! You must differenciate yourself through the exams. According to an Ed post by the professor, the first 19&ndash;21 percent get an A. Assume that at least 70% of the class is gunning for that top 20 percent. You will most likely not be in that cohort. The next 19&ndash;21 get an A&ndash;, what I am currently aiming for. The median on the midterm was a 38.5&#x2F;75. Mean: 40.43, SD 12.55 and the max was a frustrating 75. Assuming a normal distribution, my score would land me at the 70th percentile by my calculations. Good for an A&ndash;, but not ideal. <br/><br/>Recommend Proficiency:<br/>Some kind of proof based math class is required. For programming assignments, having proficiency in C++ is very very helpful (esp for programming assignment 1). Definitely take Discrete math or at least self study the subject to get familar. Some amount of statistics is helpful for the latter half of the class, but I would say having knowledge of the linearity of expectation is enough. Combinatoric notation might come in handy. All the classes recommened in the course catalogue are accurate. They are certainly not required, but helpful. <br/><br/>I hope this helps. Even if you don&#x27;t do well in this class, you can still be a great CS concentrator. Comparison kills the joy of life and remember that no matter how good you are, there is an asian better than you and this is fine. Keep pursuing what you love because you didn&#x27;t come this far, JUST to come this far. <br/><br/>Good luck...<br/>**Undertale determination music starts playing**</td>

Yet, the problem sets and exams are designed to be stressful. The course is graded on a curve, and only about 20% of people will get an A. That said, looking at the median 99 out of 100 for most psets is terrifying, and at this time the course emphasizes more minor details rather than conceptual understanding.</td>

The pset questions can be genuinely really fun to figure out, the teaching staff cares about the material, and having a pset group can be really nice. <br/><br/>howEVER. This class definitely deserves its reputation &ndash; psets can be ridiculously difficult and some took more than 40 hours, especially because typing up your problems takes SO LONG. I was kind of surprised at the level of disorganization of the course &ndash; there was always something stated vaguely or wrong and there was a lot of confusion on Ed regarding what was correct and not correct, TFs sometimes didn&#x27;t understand problems and we had multiple cases of wrong answers at office hours (to be clear I don&#x27;t think this is the fault of TFs if the problems are unclear but it takes really long if you have to keep updating&#x2F;retyping your solutions based on clarifications). I think some psets were also unreasonably long, and I&#x27;d walk into office hours just seeing people incredibly stressed all the time. Pset 7 having two of the longest proofs in the entire course and being due at the end of the course was pretty rough. <br/><br/>This course also very, very clearly favors people who have prior knowledge &ndash; progset 1 is way way easier if you can multithread&#x2F;code in a compiled language etc. Sometimes the course material is also trivialized which can be exasperating. And the exams are ROUGH &ndash;&ndash; I understand the motivation behind setting hard exams to test understanding, but having a 50% mean and advertising the difficulty of the exams (the midterm review sheet literally starts with &quot;this exam is difficult&quot; and they keep repeating the 50% mean statistic) makes the course seem like it doesn&#x27;t want you to succeed which can be pretty tiring. You will have to keep reminding yourself that this course isn&#x27;t worth sacrificing your health for (as hard and intense as it is take care of yourself first)! But in spite of that I think overall you will leave this class with so much knowledge that you didn&#x27;t have before, and it&#x27;s really intense but rewarding when you realize what you&#x27;ve learned.</td>

It is a good introduction to algorithms and methods in theoretical CS in general; e.g. standard graph algorithms, DP, hashing, flow networks, primality testing, LP. The first half of the class is very fun as there are a variety of different problems on graphs and problems which can be reduced to graph theory. The problem&ndash;solving aspect of the course is probably the best and most fun part, along with the breadth of algorithms and topics covered. The second half of the class is a bit easier probably, but also (I feel) less rigorous. For instance, LP algorithms such as simplex are introduced but not greatly elaborated on. Similarly, duality is claimed but not proven. This part thus provides a good outlook onto the field but not as much rigorous content.</td>

This class is difficult, but in my opinion, its difficulty is overhyped &ndash;&ndash; the class is definitely more manageable than the Q guide makes it out to be. I found it quite doable without having taken CS20&#x2F;CS120&#x2F;CS121&#x2F;STAT110 etc. I took this for my CS secondary (I&#x27;m a life sciences concentrator) and would def recommend CS124 even if you&#x27;re not concentrating in CS&#x2F;Math&#x2F;Stat! You learn algorithmic thinking and how to approach different problems, which I think is useful no matter what field you go into. Grading is a bit harsh though compared to other classes (only 40% of class gets A or A&ndash;),  so if grades matter to you, I would recommend taking it P&#x2F;F if you don&#x27;t need it for a letter grade. Also, Adam&#x2F;Madhu are great lecturers and TFs are usually pretty helpful as well.</td>

I have never taken a CS class at Harvard prior to this one and I am coming out with knowledge that some of my CS friends at state schools don&#x27;t have. <br/><br/>&ndash; You will form&#x2F;develop connections with people taking the course. My pset partners turned into my friends quicker than any course I&#x27;ve taken in my life &ndash;&ndash; even in grade school. <br/><br/>&ndash; If you haven&#x27;t taken a proper CS class that involves a lot of debugging, you will get some experience with the progsets without going through something as heinous as  CS 61 (so I&#x27;ve heard) Progsets could be frustrating as any other part of the course but was satisfying once completed (and finding the trick(s) to do it). <br/><br/>&ndash; You will be able to take more advance coursework after, if you are interested in that. <br/><br/>Cons: <br/><br/>&ndash; No social life. You will be maiden&ndash;less. If you have a significant other they will be complaining about all the time they are spending away from you and then break up with you. And then you will be maiden&ndash;less as well. 20&ndash;30 hours a week is average for this class, which means that your life is going to be centered around it. <br/><br/>&ndash; (More or less) Useless lectures &ndash;&ndash; no offense to the instructors, they are fine individuals and this is a bit of an exaggeration, but I did not find their lectures helpful. Maybe it&#x27;s because its my third class of the day, but I found that without consulting outside material the lectures were not very intelligible. Most of my studying <br/><br/>&ndash; Packed office hours where no one knows what&#x27;s going on, sometimes even the TFs. You could be waiting on the queue for two hours and get just a 5 minute session with one of the TFs. <br/><br/>&ndash; Poorly designed PSETs. Usually in Harvard STEM classes Psets are designed so that the first few questions are made doable without office hours (testing basic understanding). Every question is written so that office hour clarification is necessary, which is what contributes to the previous con. <br/><br/>&ndash;inherent disadvantage if you don&#x27;t code in python or C for progsets (just learn one of them before taking the class it it will make it infinitely easier).</td>

If you are a CS major and end up taking it just like everyone else, you will be fine but I hope this review helps you prepare for what’s to come! Not everyone might agree with my review as people from very very different backgrounds and with very different skills and preferences take the class. I’m writing from the perspective of someone who is usually average in CS classes and neither wanted to sacrifice the entire semester for this class (wanted to have time for fun and other stuff) nor is passionate about theoretical CS &#x2F; research &#x2F; really hard stuff. I took Math 22, Stat 110, CS50 + 51, and CS 120, which I think is good preparation for this course. <br/><br/>As dramatic as the paragraphs below might sound, it’s still a doable class and we all struggle through it together, it just requires a lot of effort and pain so it’s good to know in advance and prepare for probably one of the hardest classes you’ll ever take!<br/><br/>While at times interesting, this class will consume you and challenge you in ways you’ve probably never experienced or imagined. With unreasonably long problem sets due every week and exams designed by a sadist, it will be a nightmare from day 0. You will learn a lot but the cost is definitely high (unless you are really smart like a good amount of the kids in the class). I was basically taking 3 gems and this class so this was pretty much my only serious commitment for most weeks and it still was A LOT. Sure, a lot of students take this class and other hard classes at the same time. I couldn’t have done that, maybe you can but don’t underestimate it.<br/><br/>Regarding the TFs, I really couldn’t do what they do so I admire them. Shoutout to Andrew who has been extremely supportive and gone above and beyond what I could have ever expected as well as Ashley. Some of them are helpful, and some of them not as much? I wish there were more TFs, and more OH. There are a lot of OH but most of them are still crowded enough that it’s hard to get questions answered. Ed is a must although sometimes no member of the staff would respond a question which was pretty frustrating.<br/><br/>Lectures are the driest most boring audiovisual content I’ve ever consumed. Great if you have insomnia because they would make me fall asleep every single time. No matter what time of the day or how much I had slept the night before, 5 minutes in and I was ready for a good long night&#x27;s sleep. As a consequence, I stopped going to class (had to rewatch them anyways) and then started watching half of them (or as much as my mind could take). I couldn’t exactly tell you why they were so useless but they were, and lecture notes were not that much better. Section notes, however, life&ndash;saver resources that made the content a little less indigestible.<br/><br/>Problem sets are so long that you’ll do only that for the whole week and still have to take a (few) late day(s). They are as long as they can (un)reasonably be. The fact that they give you 12 late days for less than 12 psets should tell you all you need to know (talking about late days, wouldn’t have passed the class without them; please keep them). Psets will consume you and ruin your weekends and weeks consistently from the first one to the last one. Having said that, they do give you a pretty good understanding of the material which I appreciate and was useful to keep up with the class. However, the fact that they took forever not only was incredibly stressful but also didn’t really leave more time for engaging with the course material in other meaningful ways (reviewing lecture notes, section notes, doing section exercises, looking at the supplemental textbooks, etc). When you take the first late day, you enter a cycle where you are always late for the next deadline and the last thing that ever crossed my mind (not that I had time for it anyways) was to attempt section exercises or give a closer reading to lecture notes. I do appreciate that the optional exercises are truly optional and that at least the homework does account for a pretty considerable part of your grade so it’s effort that goes somewhere at least. So, while psets made you learn, unreasonable length and difficulty made them so painful that I’d rather learn a little less, enjoy a little more and be able to engage with the course in more ways than just complete exercises that I could have never done on my own. Like I do understand the point of having challenging exercises but when ALL of the exercises are so challenging it just becomes exhausting. Programming assignments were usually okay but still took considerable time.<br/><br/>If problem sets were hard, I can’t start talking about exams. At least in the psets it was reasonably attainable to do well if you put in the hours. Exams were sadistically designed to make you feel stupid. You are not expected to have a great score and you can still do well on the class even if you have a score that in other classes would be close to failing. However, they are so unrealistically long that it just adds up to the stressful nature of the class where it always feels like you are not smart enough to keep up. I don’t really understand the need to make an exam that half of the students can’t even get at 50% on; Maybe there is an educational argument for making exams so challenging but I for sure am not familiar with it and it is again very frustrating that it almost feels like only the kids who are genuinely smart and have an intuition for these kind of things are able to do the exams right. For the average student, the % improvement in grade per hour of study is likely to be very little. I didn’t even have time to attempt every problem. Again, I don’t understand the purpose and other CS classes (see CS120) had challenging yet manageable exams where it was easier to do well if you had a good understanding of the material.<br/><br/>In summary, this could be a good and enjoyable class because the material is often interesting and if you like problem&ndash;solving you might enjoy some of the results and things that this class covers and teaches you. However, they made it so hard that it becomes hell for most students and, if you are a little bit like me, you might end up not wanting to take another class on algorithms ever!</td>

Come to lecture, sit in the front, engage, go to office hours, do work in a timely manner, and you will not struggle. You do not need to spend more than 2&ndash;3 hours a day on this class, but only if you commit to it every day. Before taking this class, make sure you know arrays, linked lists, trees, searching, sorting, number theory, basic probability, and most importantly, proof&ndash;writing. This last one is EXTREMELY important. Problem sets require you to write proofs.<br/><br/>The way the class is structured is basically: You are briefly introduced to a new concept in class. You explore it a tiny bit. Then you really dive into the problem&ndash;solving aspect of it through the problem sets, through which you will truly understand the ins and outs of the concepts. Adam and Madhu can be dull lecturers sometimes but if you stay engaged in class and question everything they say in your head, you will find that you learn a lot.<br/><br/>Most importantly, when you take this class, sit in the front. Nobody ever does and sometimes it can really help you to stretch your legs and expose those fresh dawgs :P<br/><br/>Overall, great class. Definitely would recommend. People complain too much about the class taking up all their time and having to go to office hours and there never being time for them to ask their questions at office hours, but nobody goes to Adam or Madhu&#x27;s office hours. GO TO THEIRS. Madhu will take deterministically polynomial time to help you solve problems and Adam will take deterministically polynomial time to verify your solutions. It may be large polynomial time, but it&#x27;s still polynomial time. Together, they embody P = NP.<br/><br/>Take CS 224 if you want a challenge.</td>

Despite the necessity of office hours, they tended to be overcrowded, so you should plan to either get there early or speak to other students rather than the TF. <br/><br/>In terms of grading, the grade breakdown is 50% PSETs &#x2F; programming assignments and 50% exams. The exams are incredibly challenging (the average tends to be around a 62&#x2F;124). The grading is decently harsh; unless you spend a LOT of time on PSETs and submit incredibly detailed write&ndash;ups (and even then), you&#x27;re likely to get at least a few points off.  <br/><br/>Most questions on the PSETs ask you for an algorithm, runtime analysis, and proof of correctness.

If you&#x27;re a CS concentrator, you kind of just have to get it over with. Even if you can somehow avoid taking it, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it. You learn a lot of the basics of algorithms, and having to work through the p&ndash;sets and exams really makes you improve and better understand the material, as much as it might not feel like it in the moment. In my experience, reading through the lecture notes is sufficient (you don&#x27;t actually have to watch the lectures besides for admin stuff); what&#x27;s most important is trying to work through the p&ndash;sets yourself before you ask for help in OH or from your friends. Get started on stuff relatively early, even if you think you have the p&ndash;set done conceptually, writing it up might take you between 10 to 20 pages, and literally just typing that much that takes a while. The TFs are very nice and usually pretty helpful, and they also know that the class can feel life&ndash;draining at times (which is not their fault), so be nice to them!

I usually think the Q guide for CS50 and 51 are extremely exaggerated and take way less time they the average says, but this class is no joke. Be prepared to spending 15&ndash;20 hours a week on psets, and oh my god, the tests are very very difficult. You&#x27;ll walk out feeling horrible about it, but so does everyone else (if thats any consolation). The curve won&#x27;t be as nice as a class like Stat 110, but there still is a curve. Despite all this you will learn a lot, but you have to stay on top of work. Don&#x27;t get behind on lectures, read over the course notes, watch youtube videos, read over ED posts, and go to section if you need help with the material you learn that week or else you will be lost on the psets. You will also need to go to office hours to do these pset, as some of the solutions are insanely complicated and others are simple, but incredibly clever. That being said, I think this class and CS51 is some of the best prep you will get for technical SWE interviews. You learn so much about algorithms, data structures, their runtimes, and even though there are only 3 programming psets, it makes you a better thinker and coder.  This class will probably the hardest you ever take, but it will be worth it if you put in the work</td>
