We learned about the Federal Reserve as they hiked interest rates as Congresspeople expressed their concerns about unemployment with Jason Furman telling us he thought there was something like a 60% chance of stagflation if I remember correctly. We also learned about government debt and the deficit as the US races towards the debt ceiling with no solution in sight. Ec10b gave us very such useful and applicable information that makes reading the news and understanding public discussion so much easier, and it feels cool knowing what is going on. The assignments and lectures are clear and helpful, and the resources available on Canvas and the vast range of office hours made the class very enjoyable and made me feel supported in my learning.</td>

After taking the course, you will have a solid understanding of how the economy works. For instance, you will understand why inflation is very high right now, and you will understand why fighting the inflation resulted in the failure of Silicon Valley Bank. Having some basic knowledge about these topics is important even if you don&#x27;t end up studying economics. As a computer science concentrator, I am very grateful I took this course.<br/><br/>If you&#x27;re making a comparison to Econ 10a, you should know that Econ 10b is much more interesting. The workload is about the same, but the topics are much more relevant to everyday life.<br/><br/>Econ 10b involves many different assignments, and sometimes it becomes hard to keep track of them. Make sure to read the syllabus carefully. It is easy to forget about a deadline.<br/><br/>Problem sets are not very hard and require at most a couple of hours. They are due Monday and are perfectly doable over the weekend, but it might be harder to get TF help if you start late.<br/><br/>Unit review program is a joke, but unfortunately it&#x27;s mandatory. You have to take a mini&ndash;test every few weeks. These are pass&#x2F;fail, and it&#x27;s pretty hard to fail if you keep track of the material at least a little.<br/><br/>The essay assignment feels very unnecessary. If you do a reasonable job, you&#x27;re pretty much guaranteed &gt;90% on the essay, so no need to put too much effort into it.<br/><br/>You will see that there is a debate on the syllabus, but don&#x27;t worry too much about it, it&#x27;s completion&ndash;based.<br/><br/>The exams are actually fairly tricky. Do NOT be tricked by doing well on problem sets, you still need to study before an exam. The midterm and the final together are 55% of the grade, so it&#x27;s easy for your grade to drop if you don&#x27;t do well on the exams. (The syllabus says they might curve the grades, but this never happens in practice, the grade cut&ndash;offs in the syllabus are real.) The biggest help for an exam is doing the practice exams. Some questions are even repeated, so make sure to do practice exams AND review the solutions.<br/><br/>Overall, despite its quirks, I can recommend Econ 10b to non&ndash;economics concentrators who are looking to get a basic understanding of what economics is all about.</td>

The course content was actually far more useful to my daily life than Ec10A course content (although 10A was still interesting and applicable). I took Ec10 this year looking to be a more informed citizen and gain a better understanding of economic dynamics at play regardless of whether I end up taking further economics classes, and Ec10B was very helpful in achieving that.<br/><br/>For those who have taken Ec10A, at least in my experience 10B is a slightly heavier workload and it might take more time to sit with the material and really understand it. The course structure is exactly the same, so by the time 10B rolls around you&#x27;ll know the drill.<br/><br/>For those who haven&#x27;t taken Ec10A, the class is still very approachable. I found it helpful to have taken Ec10A since the course has a lot of moving parts (Economics in Action seminars and Unit Review in addition to lecture and section) so it might take some getting used to. The way they discuss each topic in lectures and sections is also very similar to Ec10A and in some cases builds off of 10A material (you can easily learn what you need to know from 10A in addition). Several of my friends jumped into 10B without having taken 10A and found the class pretty straightforward!</td>

Be wary that the two are in no way the same class, and make sure that you go to section and pay attention. Section is a much more integral component of learning in this class than in 10a, and having to learn it on your own just makes it that much harder when you have to do it on the PSet. The PSets are also a little more time consuming, and what you learn from them will be necessary in the course. Take Ec10b seriously, and if you actually stick with the material and take the time to learn it well you&#x27;ll be in a good position come exam time and can assure a good grade because of the relatively lenient grading policies.</td>

The psets do not take that long to do, and if you go to a section leader&#x27;s office hours or the pset collab session you can finish the written portion in like an hour. The main difference from 10a is that this class is more conceptual as opposed to formulaic which makes the exams harder, but with a good cheat sheet, you will be fine. There are a lot of drops in this class, but don&#x27;t let that make you complacent in not doing your work; try to do pre&ndash;lecture activities as soon as you see them because they literally take 2 minutes and you will forget otherwise. Take advantage of the amazing guest lecturers they bring into this class; it might not seem that cool in the moment, but you get to hear from some incredibly influential people which is amazing.</td>

This class does exactly what you were promised it would, and gives you the quintessential Harvard introduction to economics (and it&#x27;s pretty cool to take a class in Sanders, especially if you&#x27;re a freshman or haven&#x27;t done it before), but it&#x27;s totally okay if you&#x27;re not an Econ concentrator.

Lecture slides are very confusing at times. Terms are usually poorly defined, and new terms get thrown out often without definition, making it harder to understand the theories presented. Psets are significantly more challenging than those in Ec10A and usually take more time. The course has a wide variety of assessments which is unique but also quite suffocating at times; you&#x27;re assessed on the same concepts many times in essays, debates, problem sets, tests, economics in action, URP, etc. Section more helpful than lectures by far. Ec10a was helpful occasionally, but not often. I had no other background in economics and did fine. If anything this course turned me off doing an Ec secondary. It wasn&#x27;t really that enjoyable. If you&#x27;re into that stuff though, good on you, give it a go.</td>

I would highly recommend this class, especially if you didn&#x27;t take Ec10a (as I hadn&#x27;t beforehand). There are a few key things to do if you want to succeed in this class. First, get a good TF because they teach your section and grade all of your assignments (including the essay). if you start off with a brutal TF, just ask to switch. Second, go to office hours to check the PSET before it is due. Often, the answer key has nuanced explanations that you would never be able to figure out on your own, so to get 100% on all problem sets, office hours is crucial. Finally, study really hard for the exams, no matter how confident you are!

It gets difficult after the credit market and labor markets come into play with the Fed and it fell apart after that.
