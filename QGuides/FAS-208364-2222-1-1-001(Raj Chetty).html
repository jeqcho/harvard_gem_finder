The course material is very interesting and relevant, although there&#x27;s basically no discourse or discussion around it at all. I sometimes found this annoying. The labs and projects are pretty harmless, especially if you come from a STEM background. However, I thought the multiple choice exams were a bit wack. The answers were so abstract and detail&ndash;oriented, the slightest quote from a slide or the smallest word in an answer led me to do worse than I believe I should have. Overall, I think I&#x27;ll do fine in the class. Easy workload overall &ndash;&ndash; wouldnt say it&#x27;s an obvious easy A.</td>

The labs are not particularly hard — they provide a ton of guidance for how to make things work in Stata&#x2F;R, but having some experience programming in general (doesn&#x27;t have to be Stata&#x2F;R, though some exposure is super helpful) is useful and will help you finish lab assignments way faster. Empirical projects did not seem to help that much for learning, but the grading seemed to be pretty lenient. Exams are fair; just make sure you attend lecture or watch all of the lectures at some point.</td>

It is a good introductory course and some of the econometrics concepts may be useful in econometrics if you intend to be an ec concentrator. Some assignments are harder than others, so be sure to start them earlier and ask for help.</td>

The lecture material is fascinating, and it is truly a pleasure to hear from someone as bright as Professor Chetty.  That being said, lectures are not always presented in the most engaging way, so they could feel slow at times. The lab component is basically a weekly 1.25 hour session in which we learned about some quantitative method and copied starter code. As such, I feel like I didn&#x27;t really learn much Stata, but at least the assignments were not demanding. The first empirical project was fairly open ended, so I found it a cool opportunity to research our own communities. The second project was basically a long lab, so it was more straightforward. The grading for labs and projects was very lax, at least for me. The midterm and final are memorization&ndash;based, so they&#x27;re not too hard if you study.

The lectures are awesome (Raj Chetty speaks slow though, so I would recommend watching the lectures online). But, the structure of this class is awful. My lab NEVER explained the point of the labs themselves or important content that was found on the exams. Towards the end of the year, my lab gave us all the coding answers in the starter script. I would not be able to code in R outside of the course and the starter script. This is not a course for beginners in R, statistics, or economics.<br/>I felt that there was no support for students in the class. Though there is a ton of office hours, it feels like none of the CAs can answer content questions, or oftentimes, coding questions. The midterm and final exams felt unfair, with concepts that were rarely discussed or never discussed. For instance, the final included a question about a graph on a single slide from a guest speaker lecture (1 lecture of 24). And, there was not sufficient review material for the final. There was no comprehensive review session or support that would cover all of the information necessary to succeed.</td>

Lectures are more interesting than normal stat&#x2F;ec lectures because they actually apply the concepts to reality. A lot of lecture is just Prof. Chetty talking about different people&#x27;s research, so the connection to stat isn&#x27;t always clear (basically the connection is just that they used stat to conduct their research). The lab component is where you do the most stat. I did lab in stata and it was pretty easy considering I had never coded before — you are given a lot of starter code so it&#x27;s very beginner friendly. Not a ton of time is spent on explaining the stat components of the course — although they are gone over a bit in lab and you can always ask questions if you have them — so sometimes it felt like the elements of the class were a bit disjointed: lecture was applied economics, lab was coding, and the lab&ndash;prep videos were stat. The midterm was short and easy — just watch all of the lectures to prep and you&#x27;ll do great because they pull directly from lecture. The empirical projects were a bit more time&ndash;consuming and complex than a normal lab but definitely nothing too bad and if you need help there are lots of office hours available. Overall, a good way to satisfy a stat credit with minimal math and not a very big time suck. Recommend.</td>

For that reason, the statistical &#x2F; lab component of this class felt like econometrics for elementary schoolers, so it&#x27;d be quite repetitive for econ concentrators w&#x2F; lots of Stata and statistics experience. The topics covered in lectures were really interesting from an objective POV, but if you&#x27;ve already had exposure to these concepts thru previous econ &#x2F; gov &#x2F; gened courses, then it&#x27;d be repetitive for you. All in all, a GREAT way to fulfill the econ concentration writing requirement, so take it for that reason.

Lectures tend to mostly just be him talking about latest research, while labs are completely separate (ostensibly they relate to that week&#x27;s lecture, but you don&#x27;t need to have remembered what occurred in lecture to do the labs). For Stata, the instructions give you all the code you have to do, so coding background is not at all necessary &ndash; especially near the end of the semester in the Jupyter notebook labs where all you do is press run on code they wrote for you. The only homework besides two projects is the labs, and those you complete within section so there&#x27;s essentially no out of class work. The midterm has some trivially easy questions, and the instructors try their best to be lenient on grading. The course attempts to accommodate everyone regardless of background, and as a result this course is a great way to have a stress&ndash;free low workload class that satisfies the quantitative requirement and is just generally interesting.<br/><br/>One caveat is that Professor Chetty is inaccessible out of class, so if you want to ask him questions make sure to do so during lecture itself. Additionally as part of its nature of trying to be accessible by everyone, none of the units ever go much in depth so at times there can be whiplash from covering so many topics so quickly.</td>

It&#x27;s cool to learn about issues from those who generated knoweldge about it. <br/><br/>The lectures may still enhance your understanding about the best approaches to address issues, taking a step beyond simply knowing about them. Some of these best approaches may surprise you, such as the fact that nutritional disparities exist not because of lacking access to healthy food but because of nutritional choices&#x2F;lifestyles, or that criminal justice can be partially be addressed by giving judges longer lunch breaks. If you are also involved in addressing social and economic issues, you might find our lecture content useful in informing your work or providing knowledge bases that can support your work and efforts to mobilize outside support&#x2F;resources. <br/><br/>Beyond content, the course is very easy &ndash; the professor truly try to encourage all students to understand the course concepts (e.g., the assignemnts provide you the code&#x2F;answers; conceptual understanding is emphasized more) and pursue the discipline by being lax with grading.</td>

As someone who has never taken an econ&#x2F;stats&#x2F;computer science class + didn’t know anything about coding, I found this class really difficult — but not in a good way. I took the class because I wanted to be challenged, wanted to learn something new, and wanted to learn R. I don’t really feel like I’ve gained much from the class, though. It tries to do two things at once — teach about big data and economics while also teaching about R and statistics — but by trying to do both, it kinda does neither. I would have much preferred a class that focused solely on one or the other. I found that every assignment throughout the semester (labs+projects) were focused on R&#x2F;stats and felt blindsided when the midterm&#x2F;exam focused almost entirely on more conceptual understanding of economics and graphs. I also don’t feel like I came away with much knowledge of R because most of the complicated code was given to us verbatim, and there was no intro class for anyone without prior R&#x2F;stata knowledge.<br/><br/>If you have a background (even a very small one) in econ+coding (any language), I think this class is great. I genuinely learned a lot from lecture, and I think Professor Chetty is fantastic. The idea of this class is awesome — I think Professor Chetty&#x27;s work illuminating the benefits and potential of big data is important; I just think the class should not be taken by complete novices.</td>
