I only wanted to learn python (most useful for science), and it was the perfect intro course for that. I really feel like I have a solid understanding of python basics and now I can teach myself any other lines of code as they become necessary for me in research or in other settings. Assignments are reasonably spaced and have reasonable expectations, but they can be more difficult&#x2F;require more time than you initially expect, so start them early (and so you can go to OHs before they become very crowded and less productive right before the pset is due). Mike is an absolutely incredible professor and is so understanding&#x2F;helpful in his OHs, and I would take more coding classes just to continue learning from him again.</td>

The staff and OH is great but it is very stressful how quickly the course moves and the sections are more so doing other problem sets rather than actually going over confusing content. Also OH can be really busy and it is hard to get the help you need sometimes, it is overall not an intro class at all.</td>

There were so many different OH times throughout the week held by both TFs and the professors! Furthermore, the one&ndash;on&ndash;one OH sessions were EXTREMELY helpful and I highly recommend taking advantage of them. The opportunities for help were enhanced by the fact that this course does not penalize if you need to take a few extra days to submit your problem set! They prioritize students actually learning and understanding the course material and overall I had a wonderful experience in this class and really felt like I came out of it knowing how to code.</td>

The strengths of this course is that it went at a very reasonable pace and new its students&#x27; previous background well. Many of us coming into the class did not have any previous coding experience. I didn&#x27;t have any coding experience, and I find the course a good way to enter the coding world and understanding the basics of what code does. The class is very lenient with deadlines.

If you are deciding between the two, I would suggest thinking about why you want to learn code. If you want to go CS or are going into a field that requires languages like C, HTML, or JavaScript, I would suggest CS50.

It&#x27;s not easy: the concepts are tough to grasp for someone (like me) without a CS background, and the lectures can be hard to follow and honestly sometimes too boring and plodding to follow. Office hours were super helpful for psets, but I could tell the TFs were overwhelmed; I hope the course will hire more TFs in the next years.</td>

Some weeks are heavier than others if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t start the psets earlier, but in general I did not do that much work for this course.

No prior knowledge of Python is needed to do well, but it certainly will help. The assignments are short homeworks, quizzes, PSETs, and a final project. They are all very manageable if started in advance of the deadlines. Also, the teaching staff is one of the best I have had at Harvard.

You may want to get started early on the psets and please please reach out to get help if you feel yourself falling behind.

The lectures can be a little bit boring at times, but if you can pay attention in class and actually do the psets and homework, you will learn a lot assuming that you don&#x27;t have any thorough background in CS. This class took me from knowing essentially nothing to being able to read fairly complex scripts in python and solve problems that I thought were very interesting (like building an AI to beat geometry dash). It&#x27;s extremely practical and the teaching staff is super accessible and helpful. I would very highly recommend it, especially over CS 50 which is a lot more intense with very few benefits over CS 32.</td>

The staff are amazing and very understanding. Kitty and Mike are both sweethearts who truly have your best interest at heart. The course is also very interesting, but the psets can get pretty difficult so make sure to have a study group to work with.</td>
