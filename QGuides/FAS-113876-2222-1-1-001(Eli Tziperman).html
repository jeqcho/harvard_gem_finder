However, some of my complaints about the course are, in no particular order:<br/><br/>&ndash; The PSets are long and tedious. Occasionally there will be a programming assignment where you will be able to implement something relatively interesting, such as an image compression algorithm, but this often is just copying and tweaking code that is provided by the course. However, the problems otherwise often take a long time to work through and the results aren&#x27;t satisfying. They simply require a large amount of calculations, and it is frustratingly easy to make a small calculation mistake (e.g. when entering a decimal point number into Python&#x2F;MATLAB, which occurs relatively often) that requires doing a large part of the problem again.<br/>&ndash; The PSet expectations are not made very clear. The instructions for each PSet say something along the lines of, only use Python&#x2F;MATLAB when explicitly required, otherwise only show calculations as done on a 4&ndash;function calculator. However, following these instructions exactly make the PSets take even longer, and the course staff has acknowledge in many circumstances that Python&#x2F;MATLAB&ndash;aided solutions are allowed, but it is difficult to ascertain this information without asking them about every question individually.<br/>&ndash; The course staff is not particularly responsive on the online forum. I understand that office hours are always an option, but some questions on the forum will remain there unanswered for multiple days, which seems to defeat the purpose of its existence.<br/>&ndash; The lecture notes are helpful, but they are a work in progress (i.e. they contain some errors). Furthermore, it is impossible to download them locally to a device, which means that without internet connection (which occurs very often in the lecture hall or just randomly due to Harvard WiFi), it is impossible to see the notes. The lecture notes exactly lay out the structures of the lecture and are generally easy to follow, but there are almost no other supplementary materials to use in case those fail.<br/>&ndash; There are two midterms which are each 2.5 hours, are outside of lecture time, and for which very few PSet accommodations are made. This essentially means there are three final&ndash;length exams throughout the semester. Also, on a typical week, a PSet would be due on Tuesday with lectures on Tuesday and Thursday; on an exam week, lectures are still Tuesday&#x2F;Thursday, the exam is Wednesday, and the PSet is due on Friday, with another PSet due the next week. Generally, it seemed that the course staff was not particularly understanding of how students&#x27; workloads increase during midterm exam periods.<br/>&ndash; Many of the calculation&ndash;based problems on the practice exams did not have solutions, only answers that were simply outputted from Python&#x2F;MATLAB, despite the fact that it is expected to show all the steps of work during the exam itself.<br/><br/>In summary, I did not enjoy the class. It&#x27;s the most popular way to fulfill the algebra requirement in the applied math concentration, and that&#x27;s because the material taught is genuinely interesting and generally useful, but there are a lot of logistical improvements they could have made, and it often seemed like there was an excessive amount of busywork.</td>

Most of the material on the exams are problems very similar to those found in the book. The homework can be quite tedious as there is often a lot of coding (especially in the second half of the course) which can take up time. Lastly, a huge problem I had with the course is that, on exams, you are required to perform brute force calculations such as large matrix multiplications where it is very easy to accidentally type something wrong in your calculator, etc. The course staff provides all solutions for the practice exams in Matlab while you are supposed to do everything by hand, which I found very frustrating.</td>

And if you ar win Applied Math, I highly recommend taking this course. The Lecture Notes are great, allow you to review all the material from the lectures, and help so much for the PSets. In terms of difficulty, the PSets take a good amount of time (8&ndash;10 hours), but they are not too hard. In most cases, it just takes time to code and figure out what the question asks, but you can almost always do it without needing TF help. As for the tests, they do require a good amount of studying to do well. I found the practice tests to be sufficient, and the material is not too conceptually challenging.

Lectures are fun—Eli is entertaining and kind. The content is pretty interesting and can be applied to many fields in AM. Problem sets are generally ok but often VERY tedious&#x2F;robotic (beware of Problem Set 1. Start early because it is extremely long) algebraically, with weird numbers or repetitive processes that you&#x27;ll be asked to do by hand. You probably won&#x27;t learn Matlab in this class, because you&#x27;ll be taking his example code and editing a few lines somewhat blindly. If you liked proof&ndash;based math, this class is not that—it is almost entirely, &quot;here&#x27;s a process! Look, it works on this example. Ok onto the next process.&quot; Which is fine, but I didn&#x27;t feel like I actually understood many things for real. The fact that quiz and homework solutions are almost entirely in Matlab code even when the problem asks to do it by hand does not help.  Overall less chill than I expected and caused a lot of frustration due to its design, but not a horrible class, and a good introduction to the applications of linear algebra.</td>

In general, problem sets were consistent in terms of length and difficulty — they took a while to complete, but they were usually doable and, whenever I got stuck, there were plenty of office hours for help.</td>

Eli is great and kind. The course notes are applied and straightforward. The topics are relevant, interesting, and make sense. There is a distinct flow to the class, and I felt like even though I covered most of the topics in other classes, this course really unionized all the disparate concepts into a cohesive workflow. Everything came together, and applying them in problem sets just solidified them more. Overall, a great class that make me much more confident in my machine learning communication&#x2F;application skills.</td>

Eli&#x27;s lectures are fun, if a little stressful to keep up with, but you don&#x27;t really need to write all the details because the course notes are super helpful. The content of the course is a great applied math course because every concept feels connected back to the real world. The PSETs do take a while but after you do them you actually know all the skills you are supposed to. The quizzes are super fair and very similar to the previous year quizzes, so you should know exactly what you are getting. Also, the grading is very chill&ndash;&ndash; the TFs are very generous and almost every assignment has extra credit (including the class itself being graded out of 105 points). Overall, feels very fair and you learn things that actually feel useful.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_5ea8cd3e-e448-4dcd-860c-9a6e5686006b">My big takeaways are: (a) the first pset is extremely long and messy, but you should stick with the class, as it almost immediately gets much more manageable! (b) the exams are super fair and relatively consistent; that is, working through previous exams is the best way to prepare for upcoming midterms and finals (c) use MATLAB instead of Python, even if you are much better versed in Python! It&#x27;s just so much easier, efficient, and better made for working with matrices. (d) I didn&#x27;t take Math 21b before this class, which made me super nervous going into the semester, but it was totally doable. The first pset is basically a review of 21b concepts, so just pay close attention to those techniques as they will reappear later on. All in all, Eli is an excellent professor and really cares about the quality of his instruction; he&#x27;s super organized, which makes for a positive, relatively stress&ndash;free learning experience for everyone.</td>

The multivariable calculus is very minimal (only thing you have to know is gradients basically), so one semester of linear algebra is enough preparation. The computer programming aspect is also minimal (mostly just editing from the sample code they give), so no experience needed beyond CS50 or knowing the basics of Python&#x2F;MatLab. Homework is a bit tedious (don&#x27;t be scared off by homework 0 which is all done by hand and is extremely long with disgusting looking answers), so it helps to find others in class to compare answers with to make sure you aren&#x27;t crazy</td>

Instead of being knee&ndash;deep in useless material such as linear spaces from 21b, you will instead take a dive into the concepts essential to machine learning and big data. Topics ranging from singular value decomposition, principal component analysis, neural networks (feedforward, back propagation), decision trees, random forests, etc. The material is levels above that of 21b and actually holds usefulness to fields in data science.<br/><br/>Beware of the first pset. It is VERY LONG, so please for the love of Larry Bacow start it early, because I guarantee that you will regret staying up until 4am the night before it&#x27;s due solving eigen&ndash;problems. However, the psets afterwards definitely do get better, and the homework help sessions are great for getting them done. The last three psets on neural networks are the most code&ndash;heavy out of all the psets. Also, DO THE PSETS IN MATLAB, it will make your life so much more convenient. MatLab literally stands for matrix laboratory, so it&#x27;s like it was made for this class?!<br/><br/>Lastly, I want to talk about the star of the show: Professor Eli Tziperman. Eli is a genuinely kind person to get to know. He cares about his students and whether or not they are motivated by the course. He tries really hard to engage students during lectures with jokes about himself and his family and other amusing topics you will find out (especially during the ODEs part of the course). He really wants you to succeed and have fun with the course, and that is what I love about him. However, lecture can be slow at times, and it sometimes gets hard to understand him. Though, he makes up for it by adding some motivating concepts during class by showing application areas for the concepts being taught. Eli is an awesome person, so definitely GO TO HIS OFFICE HOURS and take him out to Classroom 2 Table. Most importantly, figure out how to pronounce his name early on!<br/><br/>First lecture, I thought this class had many red flags, including how there was going to a pset over spring break (crazy right?). However, as the semester was winding down, I learned to appreciate the course and the professor plus the teaching staff. I genuinely took a TON out of this course, more than from 21b. This is a class that I definitely recommend! Now, you may be thinking &quot;this guy might just be smart and overstating the course.&quot; But listen to me, I was definitely NOT one of the smartest students taking the course. I struggled with the psets and quizzes from time to time, and I usually took longer to understand the concepts than others, especially during neural networks. However, this course is great. I urge to you to take it, because like you have definitely heard before, this course is extremely rewarding. By the end of the semester, you will look back at everything and appreciate how useful and fun this course was. So, definitely go to Eli&#x27;s office hours, get to know him more, and pour some time into understanding the concepts. The ride will be a long one, but it&#x27;s one that will be &quot;interesting, useful, and fun&quot; (you will understand the reference once you take the course :) ).</td>

Psets took longer than expected (and hoped), but are very doable if you give yourself enough time. The course uses an online  textbook. The notes are very clear and include everything you need to know. They are not printable, however, which is very annoying as the material is very dense and can be difficult to read online.</td>
