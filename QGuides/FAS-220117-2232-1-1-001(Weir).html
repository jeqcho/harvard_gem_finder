I wish the lectures could be longer&#x2F; have more time slots! Every time I felt like Prof. Weir&#x27;s lecture was cut short because of the time constraint. The final has an objective part that covers some (maybe insignificant) details in the novels, which I personally think may not be the best thing to do on a literature exam?</td>

It does seem like a lot of reading at the beginning (and feels that way at some times, particularly with Dostoevsky who is a bit dense) but honestly reading these novels is so enjoyable that it doesn&#x27;t feel like a lot of work. I would say, though, that you should not take this class if you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ll be able to keep up with the reading for the novels. Because they are novels and we spend a lot of time on them if you fall a week or two behind it is really really hard to catch up and that means you will be a bit lost in section, lecture, etc. The shorter readings you can skip, though, and make them up during reading period (though I would suggest trying to get through some of them because reading all of them during reading period is a bit of a heavy lift). You will have to make them up, though, because the final exam will test you on them. The weekly section posts are pretty chill, as is the midterm essay (I feel like I got a much better grade than I deserved). The final seems intimidating because of the questions where you have to recall really specific details, but I think the instructors give you enough leeway for them. I took the oral exam for this and it was pretty chill, though I would not recommend if you haven&#x27;t done the readings because you will not be able to bluff your way through, and I would also not recommend if you don&#x27;t do well when put on the spot&#x2F; under pressure because you don&#x27;t have much time to think. Overall, though, this class is great. The readings are so fun and rewarding &ndash;&ndash;&ndash; I was frequently thinking about them just in my daily life. Really cannot recommend this course enough, if you think Russian Lit might be your cup of tea.</td>

Weir is an amazing lecturer, and each of the readings are incredibly interesting. If you are looking for a chance to explore Russian literature and haven&#x27;t done so before (like me), I would definitely suggest this gened if it is offered again! The section component was also pretty good, and I found that it was accessible to students from non&ndash;humanities backgrounds (most of the time). One thing that I definitely noticed was that there were two separate groups within the class: those who had read Tolstoy &amp; Dostoevsky before, and those who hadn&#x27;t. However, it seemed that most students were reading the stories and novels through a strictly ethical&#x2F;moral lens for the first time, so everyone was able to engage in interesting moral discussions in section and in the midterm paper, regardless of background.  <br/><br/>I do wish this course had a paper for the final instead of a timed final, as personally I loved having the chance to conduct my own exploration of the moral dilemmas in Anna Karenina (in a non&ndash;timed setting), and wished I had the chance to do so with The Brothers Karamazov, as I found its dilemmas far more interesting.  <br/><br/>Initially, I had no qualms with the timed final, as it seemed to me at first that it would be strictly focused on the moral questions of the class readings. However, one thing that was not made clear until later in the semester was that the final would consist not just of written essays, but would also have questions gauging whether we knew the readings or not. As a significant chunk of enrolled students had already read these works before (with some having read them *multiple* times beforehand), this was a tad frustrating, as it meant that I would have to revisit every reading again before the final to internalize minute details that had little to no bearing on the plot (or the moral questions we had been discussing all semester), and would not be picked up on a first read of these works. While this wasn&#x27;t impossible, it definitely caused this class to take up quite a bit of time, especially during reading period. This was probably my only issue with the class, and I wish we had more of a heads&ndash;up that we were expected to be able to answer these types of questions earlier in the semester, as it would have changed how I approached the readings. With that being said, if you take this class, be ready to spend a lot of time on the readings!</td>

The books are also very Christian, which is tough without any sort of Christian background. Ask yourself if you can really listen to 75&ndash;minute lectures of straight talking without slides twice a week– it&#x27;s tough.

That being said, definitely take the time to decide if you want to take this course. The readings are very long (over the semester you read two 600 page novels, several short stories, and philosophical writings) and can be very difficult to get through. If you do not like philosophy, avoid this course. If you struggle with in&ndash;depth discussions about death&#x2F;religion&#x2F;suicide, avoid this course.

The weekly workload is totally manageable (just the reading + discussion posts, and then a midterm and final). The lectures were sometimes a little subpar, and I think that was because Professor Weir prioritized breadth over depth, making the lectures kind of weak. I think he was a bit mediocre as a teacher, and though I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s very smart, he didn&#x27;t always show that insight. Also&ndash;&ndash; he was a bit arrogant, and he got a little sadistic when it came to the final for some odd reason. He started talking about it ~a month and a half before the end of the semester and would get giddy describing how he would test the limits of our knowledge, like whether we could remember (insert the most minute detail of Anna Karenina here). <br/><br/>And I don&#x27;t know why they made such a big deal about memorizing minute details about each work for the final (like what is the rival horse&#x27;s name in AK?) All that does is reward people who have photographic memories, but not the kids who actually read the works. They should have asked about meaningful details, not random ones!</td>

Reading two substantial novels in the course of a semester was rewarding, and I feel like I really understand both authors, so a deeper dive into Russian literature would be easy given the context I already had. Beyond that, the course does not necessarily assume a level of literary analysis from its students, and I felt like that skill was particularly worked through lecture and discussion posts, allowing me to engage with the reading much more critically than I typically do.

When else are you going to read such great works of literature — truly massive and groundbreaking — in an accessible and approachable way? Professor Weir is so incredibly knowledgeable about these works and a wonderful lecturer who really helps illuminate so many aspects of these texts that can be challenging to understand at first. Be prepared to work, however, knowing that there will be hundreds of pages of reading throughout the semester... but it is such a rewarding experience, so it is worth it! You&#x27;ll dig into ethical questions and learn more about the contexts in which these texts were written too, providing a lot of valuable background that you might otherwise not be able to get in reading these novels on their own outside of class.</td>

First, only take it if you have a light semester, as the reading load is typically over 100 pages per class session (200 per week) and can be slow going (Anna Karenina and the Brothers K are not page&ndash;turners). Second, you have to have a good attention span, as the lectures are not super engaging or easy to stay attentive during. But it was great to read some classic works that I probably would not have if not assigned for a class, and if you are a lover of literature, engaging with these texts will be a joy.</td>
