The exams were not fair at all, the questions are intended to trick you, there isn&#x27;t enough time, and the online system lead to rampant cheating that felt extremely unfair and disruptive to students not cheating. The PIES should NOT be on a weekend or Friday, as they destroy student&#x27;s lives outside of class. These PIEs caused myself and many others to experience depressive spirals. 40 points is not enough for a good depiction of my understanding. If you miss even just 2 of the trick multiple choice questions worth 5 points, then you get a 30&#x2F;40 or 75% with often no chance to explain your reasoning for partial credit. I loved biology before taking this course, I had conducted molecular biology research published in national journals and planned to declare. After taking LS1b I am dreading taking a biology course at Harvard again, not because I dislike biology but hate how it is taught.</td>

Pardis is a good lecturer as well, Andrew and Hopi are just in another league. But, Pardis really cares about the subject matter and the students which definitely comes through in her teaching. Psets are not too long and too difficult. Go to SSN!! You can finish the entire pset in 1 two hour SSN; highly recommend this strategy. PIEs are not great. They can be difficult and a time crunch, but there are so many of them that you can afford to do badly on 1 or 2. Lab and section can be annoyingly long, but the labs are interesting. Don&#x27;t be scared of taking ls1b with ps11. It can be a lot of work at times, but it&#x27;s totally manageable, especially if you plan your time well. When studying for PIEs, use the posted lecture notes, lowdown videos, and tutorials and you will be set. I also recommend making a study guide for each PIE so that you already have preparation when the final comes around. I really did enjoy this class, and I would take it again.

I thought I was a biology person, but I felt much more supported in LS1a than in this class. LS1b is your standard intro Harvard pre&ndash;med class. Weekly psets, weekly labs, and bi&ndash;weekly PIEs.  Psets are fine, and if you find decent office hours or a good pset group you should be ok there. Labs and lab assignments are boring and huge wastes of time that are neither enriching nor interesting enough to take up two hours a week, in my opinion. There&#x27;s a huge lab assignment in the beginning of the semester and one at the end of the semester and both of them felt like colossal time&ndash;wasters. As for PIEs, as long as you use the practice material they put up (there&#x27;s a lot of it), you should do well enough. Overall, the class is fine. It&#x27;s nothing special, and it didn&#x27;t change me or the way I see biology or anything like that.

The labs are also super cool applications of the lecture material (like sequencing and analyzing your own DNA at some really cool genes!), especially if you have some friends in your lab group.  That said, it&#x27;s difficult.  There&#x27;s a reason this is the last premed course some people take at this school.  PIEs are difficult and really take preparation, and you don&#x27;t get much of a break from them since they&#x27;re every other week.  Your section has the ability to either be a life&ndash;saving tool for teaching excellent problem&ndash;solving hacks, or a complete waste of time that confuses you, all based on your TF.  Additionally, much of your grade is determined by your TF, and some were far more lenient than others in grading your PSets and lab work.  LS1b is a grindfest, but you&#x27;re probably taking it because you have to anyways, so try your best to appreciate the wondrous and fascinating parts of this course, and in every other aspect of the course, just try your best.</td>

Material is highly interesting and all three lecturers were enthusiastic and provided interesting context for the concepts covered (and Andrew Berry is a beast!!!!), lecture NOTES are highly highly useful for studying and for psets, way more than lecture slides. PIEs are annoying because they are only out of 40 points so if you get one thing wrong you automatically get a B. Def take advantage of office hours for psets because sometimes there are tricky things hidden in the problem that you&#x27;ll never realize on your own.

I walked into this course expecting it to be quite a bit of busywork and nontrivially hand&ndash;holdy (due to it being an intro course). But what I did not expect was to spend 10&ndash;20 hours a week doing useless busywork. <br/><br/>Besides that, the grading is very messed up due to the following reasons:<br/><br/>1. PIEs are almost half of your grade in the course. They are online and open&ndash;note, but there is rampant cheating. This bumps up the cutoffs for grades, making it very difficult to do well in the course, even if you make a few silly mistakes here and there.<br/>2. Everything you turn in, other than the exams, is graded by your TF. Thus, your grade is entirely in the TF&#x27;s hands. Certain TFs may be very kind and lenient with grading while other TFs count off just because they want to (or on a whim, depending on whether they like you or not). If you have a particularly strict or mean TF, you are already put at a significant disadvantage. <br/><br/>Additionally, your experience in the course is dictated entirely by your 3 hour section (which includes discussion and lab) led by your TF. Otherwise, you do not interact with the course staff at all. If your TF is not good or does not know the material, your experience in the class will be absolutely awful, as was mine.<br/><br/>I have not taken a class that I dislike more than I dislike LS1B.

Hopi was great at solidifying problem solving techniques, and Pardis does a great job of extrapolating the class to a modern day emphasis on disease management and gene editing considerations. I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the class structure beyond the lecturers, and it can get stressful just because of the stringency in grading and lack of support. Your TF can make or break your experience.  Be wary of the PIEs and study the material every week— lecture notes, practice problems and PIEs are extremely helpful. Stay on top of labwork and pay attention to the details of formatting answers for assignments— the rubric can be very unforgiving and the teaching staff doesn&#x27;t do much to support you through them.</td>
