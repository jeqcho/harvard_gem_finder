It left students in the dust, forced to move on to new topics without developing a deep enough intuition of the last topic to understand it. Easily three classes of material were skimmed over.<br/>&ndash; On top of this, assignments were returned months after we turned them in, so students didn’t even know whether they understood the material.<br/>&ndash; The psets were WAY too hard. They asked us to prove things we hardly understood (this is not a proof based class), work with complicated equations we hadn’t seen in class, and often felt disconnected from course material. Many of the homeworks were simply so ridiculous I had no hope of completing them myself.<br/>&ndash; The grading scheme is terrible. Instead of an A&ndash;F scale it is graded as R=&quot;ready to move on&quot;, R&ndash;,  and L=&quot;learning&quot;. It felt completely arbitrary based on the person grading your work whether the same mistake received an L or R&ndash;. The psets were also graded by the minimum score you got on any problem. Thats crazy! The grading was very binary and it was almost impossible to get an R, so if felt like putting more work in did not get you a better grade. Similarly, someone else could get twice as many things wrong as you on a pset&#x2F;exam and get the same grade, which felt unfair. Or you could misremember one formula in an entire problem and get the same grade as if you knew none of it.<br/>&ndash; The assignments were released and due at a different time every week, making it impossible to set a schedule or consistently attend a TF’s office hours. Or it would be announced that a pset would be released and then it wouldn’t be released until 4 days later, and would be due at the same time (meaning we would have very little time to work with it).<br/>&ndash; The corrections on the psets and exams did not work. For them to be helpful, we would need to get assignments back really fast then learn from our mistakes before moving onto the next material. Instead they would come back 2 months after we did the assignment and I ended up doing all of the corrections after the last assignment was due. So they were not helping us learn&#x2F;solidify material, they were just extra work piling up during finals period. <br/>I am really sad that this class turned out like this.

It needs people who show up to office hours so we don&#x27;t waste time rapidly coming to office hours no one is at. With a strong revamp of the course this could be a really great course.</td>

I believe that Robert Haussman was not aware he was teaching the class until very late, and as a result it was very chaotic and mismanaged. <br/><br/>The lectures were usually aimless, and at times they did not give us the necessary knowledge to complete the problem sets and other material. The problem sets that we did have were pretty good, but the questions could be extremely tedious and computationally&ndash;intensive. Furthermore, the grading was extremely slow, to the point where they returned something at the end of the semester 4 hours before the revisions were due, which was especially frustrating for seniors. <br/><br/>In total, this class is essential for many students, it has great applications to engineering&#x2F;physics&#x2F;chemistry, and it is a good stepping&ndash;stone class for people who have just completed 21a&#x2F;21b (or equivalents). But I would not recommend it to anyone until it improves.</td>

Do not take this course unless you absolutely have to (and if you have to, try to take it without Haussman as the instructor). There were no lecture notes throughout the entire semester, so it was impossible to follow what was being taught in lecture whatsoever, and the textbook we were using barely lined up with the examples we were given in class, so learning the material for problem sets was quite a difficult challenge. We didn&#x27;t get course feedback until at least 5 weeks into the semester, and feedback was delayed. The quizzes were too long to take in the designated period online. Our messages on Ed were ignored and only responded to multiple days to a week after we posted them (what&#x27;s the point of being able to ask questions on Ed then?!). Pset release dates kept on getting pushed back without any notice, and it got to the point where psets were being released at least a week after they were originally supposed to be released. When the entire class just wanted  a bit of clarity on how things were going to be graded or any semblance of organization or dates, our requests were continually ignored over email, on Ed, and even in class. It even got to the point where on the final day where grades were due, we were supposed to be revising and turning in our quizzes&#x2F;psets for revised grades, but the instructor only gave us our final two quizzes ~16hrs and 2.5hrs before the 5pm deadline. The teaching staff (except the only undergraduate TF) was unprofessional and unresponsive. All in all, I wouldn&#x27;t take this class outside of my concentration requirement unless there were some serious instructional&#x2F;structural changes.</td>

This has been the worst class experience I’ve ever had, and that’s saying a lot as an engineering student. The only thing I could count on being consistent was the extreme delay in grades and my frustration with the course.<br/>	To start things off, Robert created a new grading system that gets rid of the usual numbers and replaces them with N, L, R&ndash;, R, and R+. While this didn’t really affect me that much as a student, it was super inconvenient to understand how I was doing academically in the class. From the first day, we asked Robert to release the grade conversion table (that he claims to have had) so we could better understand if we would end up with a good grade in the end or not. Week after week, Robert wouldn’t release the conversion table even as we continued to ask him. Even as I sit here writing this on May 15th, I still don’t have a conversion table other than Robert saying that R’s would correspond to A’s. <br/>	To add to this confusion, the grading in this class was super inconsistent. Robert told us that if we got an R on every question of a problem set except for one R&ndash; that the entire problem set would receive an overall grade of an R&ndash;. Basically, you can do really well on every problem except one and that one problem would determine your overall assignment grade. This, however, was not the case throughout the semester. There were multiple instances where I would receive the exact same subscores as one of my peers but they would receive an overall grade that was one grade lower than mine (e.g. I would get an R and they would get an R&ndash;). There were also instances where points were deducted for a question that wasn’t even asked (e.g. “didn’t answer why ____” when that question wasn’t even asked of us). <br/>Our problem sets were originally due weekly on Wednesdays, but very early in the semester this day started changing. It originally was delayed to Thursday because the previous problem set was not released on time. Then the date moved to Friday because of the same issue. There was even a time when a problem set was due on a Sunday because it wasn’t ready for release yet. Problem sets 5 and 6 were combined to help get us back on track, but it was one of the most stressful weeks for me to get it done.<br/>With these changing deadlines, the office hours schedule remained the same, however. As someone who relied heavily on office hours just to comprehend what the problem sets were asking me to solve, these changing deadlines created a lot of unneeded stress. I could only attend office hours on Tuesdays (one in the afternoon and one in the evening), so this meant that I worked on the problem sets at the end of the week and over the weekend (or whenever they were released). When problem sets were released on Sundays or Mondays, I was left cramming in the assignment on my very busy Mondays to try and make a dent before office hours. And it’s not like I was a procrastinator; the problem sets would take hours to complete because they were so long and very hard to understand most of the time. On weeks where we would only have 5 days instead of 7 to work on a problem set because of a late release, Robert would shorten the problem set by a problem or two. However, the problem sets were still extremely long and very stressful to complete with the shorter timeline.<br/>To add to this growing frustration, there were multiple instances where Gradescope assignments weren’t created until the day before the assignment was due. This meant that even if we finished our problem sets early, we had to wait around for the submission to be opened. This led to a great deal of confusion and stress since we as students maintain very meticulous schedules that shouldn’t revolve around Gradescope submissions being opened so we can finally submit homework and cross it off our to&ndash;do list. When our check&ndash;ins moved online, this same issue occurred but was more impactful since we were supposed to turn in our quizzes within 30 minutes of the Canvas quiz closing. You can’t turn in a quiz on Gradescope if no assignment exists. It’s as simple as that.<br/>Not only would Gradescope assignments not be open for submission, Robert would often release check&ndash;ins multiple days late. The way that check&ndash;ins 3&ndash;5 worked (we were supposed to have 6 check&ndash;ins total actually, but Robert was so behind by the end of the semester that we only did 5) was that they were taken asynchronously within a 5 day window. This window was usually Friday&ndash;Wednesday. However, there were multiple instances where Robert wouldn’t release the quiz until Sunday or even Monday. This led to many students blocking time out of their schedules on Fridays or Saturday mornings to take a quiz that wasn’t available to be completed. They then had to rearrange their schedule in the days that followed to accommodate this quiz that they should have been able to take when Robert said it would be released.<br/>Let’s talk about how we communicated with the teaching staff. Robert chose to use Ed as the main platform of communication, but this was such a mistake. Not only is Ed just an unnecessary platform to use when most classes already use Slack, but Robert and the rest of the teaching staff (except for our Queen Annabelle) wouldn’t answer important questions. Granted, if someone had a question about the wording on a problem set, Robert was decently quick to respond. But heaven forbid someone asked when we were going to get grades back. By the last day of the semester, there were sooooo many unanswered posts on Ed regarding revisions, grading, and end&ndash;of&ndash;semester plans. <br/>Since we couldn’t get answers on Ed, we had to resort to using class time to ask questions that Robert would refuse to answer on Ed. There was an instance in one of the last weeks of class where I asked a question that spiraled into other students asking questions and providing suggestions for 20 minutes straight. This essentially ended with Robert saying that he had made many compromises already (e.g. one less quiz, one less homework assignment, etc) and that he couldn’t just cancel the last quiz. Keep in mind that this is the same time that we all had final projects for other classes that we already budgeted time for. I have to say that a lack of planning does not constitute a compromise on Robert’s part; he made many decisions and would refuse to let go of his original vision of the class that led to us, the students, having to make many compromises just to finish the class. We had to compromise our time and sanity just to get our assignments done.<br/>Now to talk about lectures. I can’t for the life of me understand why we spent the first 20&ndash;30 minutes of class recapping what we learned the previous class. This was a waste of time and meant that I mentally checked out during class right at the beginning. I also don’t understand why lectures couldn’t be recorded or why lecture notes (or even lecture topics) weren’t posted. There were many days where I was not feeling well (both physically and mentally) but I knew I couldn’t miss class because I would end up behind in the content and would be lost on the problem set. I don’t see how this was the standard for a class where the professor called quizzes low&ndash;stake opportunities to check in with our learning.</td>

Hopefully, with a different instructor and a larger course staff to provide faster grading, it may prove more pleasant. The material is not intrinsically difficult. The problem sets were inordinately long and did not provide sufficient practice dealing with certain concepts (such as power series). Robert also did not sufficiently explain when to use certain strategies, which made things confusing in the second half.</td>

If Haussman is teaching it, don&#x27;t take it (at least for a few years). He&#x27;s a great lecturer. I think he genuinely cares, but this semester was rough for him in more ways than one, and when put under pressure he couldn&#x27;t perform as well as I hope he has the potential to. The grading system is not good. It will leave you confused and frustrated. The return rate on assignments was very bad. He gave us four out of fifteen assignments back on the last week of finals period (imagine how long we were waiting on the other eleven assignments throughout the semester). Ordinarily, this wouldn&#x27;t be a problem if a large structure of the class wasn&#x27;t centered around doing corrections on assignments. In the end when we asked for flexibility, he essentially said no. No PSET drop, no quiz drop, nothing really. His response was &quot;he thought he had been flexible,&quot; which is quite presumptuous considering he should be flexible because he was the root of the problem. I am a senior. I have taken 32 classes here. It never occurred to me my very last class would be my worst.</td>

It also took the course staff multiple weeks to grade assignments, even though we had a problem set due every single week. In fact, on multiple occasions, the professor would promise to return grades on problem sets or check&ndash;ins before the next class, but he rarely did so. Also, the problem sets got released a few days late every other week, but the deadline would stay the same, so we would have to complete seven problems with five parts each in three days.

Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Prof. Haussman is definitely enthusiastic about the material and is a great lecturer. However, everything else about this course was terrible. Here are the major issues I encountered:<br/><br/>1. Grading turnaround. This course was supposed to have 11 problem sets and 6 check&ndash;ins. We ended up having 10 problem sets and 5 check&ndash;ins, and even with the reduced assignment load, the course staff could not keep up with grading (likely because the course staff was too small). Considering that we had the ability to correct and resubmit a select number of assignments, this became incredibly frustrating, as I could not plan ahead for grade releases and would often have to find time at the last minute to do a rewrite. On top of this, we received a large number of grades back during reading period and the final exam period, creating a ton of unneeded stress for students who needed to complete rewrites.<br/><br/>2. Lack of commitment. This is somewhat related to the last point, but throughout the semester, we were often told by Prof. Haussman that we would receive grades and feedback on an assignment by a given time. However, we rarely (if ever) received the assignment back by the given time, making it impossible to stay on top of rewrites. The worst instance of this was with the final check&ndash;in. We were told that we would receive grades by the end of the night on May 11th (during exams!!!!!), and would have to submit any rewrites by 5pm on the 12th. Not only was this giving us &lt;24 hours to do the assignment at a time during which people either had exams or had already left campus, we didn&#x27;t receive the grade until 1:30pm on the 12th, giving us &lt;4 hours to turn in rewrites (until he backtracked on his decision 2 hours later and gave us all a free grade boost). I found this to be incredibly disrespectful towards the students in the course, as multiple had stated on our class Ed that they had exams from 2&ndash;5pm or were in completely different timezones. <br/><br/>3. Changes to the syllabus. When I decided to stay in this course during add&#x2F;drop week, we were still following the structure laid out in the initial syllabus. However, not long after, we saw significant changes to the format of the Friday class. Initially, the Friday class was supposed to be on a rotation, with 40 minute check&ndash;ins every other week alternated with lectures or workshops. However, the second check&ndash;in was moved to a Monday, all following check&ndash;ins were done asynchronously, and check&ndash;ins 4 &amp; 5 were made to take 75 minutes. While I usually prefer asynchronous assessments, this meant that the Friday class permanently became a 75 minute lecture and I would have to commit extra time to digest the additional lecture material and set aside time to take a check&ndash;in for 3 weeks (on top of completing the weekly pset for this class and rewrites!). With this change occurring more than halfway through the semester, it became very difficult to find the time to take on these additional commitments, as I had already built my schedule for this course and the other courses I was taking this semester. <br/><br/>The extra stress placed on me as a result of this course truly interfered with my ability to keep up not just with this course, but with every other commitment I had for the semester. If nothing is done to change this course, I suggest you consider alternatives.</td>

It teaches you all the necessary fundamental essentials to solve ordinary differential equations analytically. It also covers a great introduction to solving partial differential equations as well. Along the way, there is a good amount of code to visualize things and some use of numerical methods for practical ways of solving ODEs. If you have any interest whatsoever in understanding how differential equations work (because you&#x27;re interested in physics, modeling, or quantitative biology), then it is definitely a worthwhile class. Like calculus, it probably does not matter that much who is teaching it, and the books can always supplement if lectures are not enough.</td>

I love math, and I have loved all of the math classes I have taken at Harvard so far—except for AM 105. This class has managed to be the single most disorganized, frustrating, ridiculous experience I’ve ever had in my entire academic career. This is not something I ever expected to see at Harvard, but I guess I can’t say I’m very surprised.<br/><br/>There were plenty of occasions where problem sets were released, and then two days before the problem set was due, we would still be learning content we needed to know to complete the problem set. This issue by itself is not a huge concern. However, it gets worse. <br/><br/>The office hours schedule was not even remotely close to being of assistance. Not only were there only office hours on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesdays, but most of these office hours were either at extremely common times when classes are scheduled, or times that made it almost impossible to attend. For a while at the beginning of the semester, there were office hours on Wednesdays right before class at the SEC. Classes were held at Maxwell Dworkin.<br/><br/>Additionally, one of the office hours locations was impossible to find. In fact, this vagueness seemed deliberate. The CA responsible for the Pforzheimer office hours seemed incapable of specifying where in the dining hall he held his office hours. He was either late or ended his office hours early on several occasions, and failed to respond to multiple email requests and requests on Ed to clarify where the office hours were held.<br/><br/>Most problem sets were due on Friday. So, now taking into consideration the awful office hours schedule, how is it fair to expect students to complete problem sets in a timely manner when they don’t have a full week to work through all of the problems, and they do not even have access to office hours for entire questions on the problem set? It is not.<br/><br/>Finally, the grading. I appreciate the R+&#x2F;R&#x2F;R&ndash; scale, and I understand the intention. That was okay. My problem is with the fact that grades were never returned in a timely manner. This was true for both problem sets and quizzes. This made it impossible to determine how you were doing in the class and, more importantly, whether you needed to change your approach in the class when it came to problem set formatting or just basic understanding of concepts. This withheld information would affect you for at least 2&ndash;3 problem sets, and the cycle would repeat.<br/><br/>The concepts in the class are amazing. This is solely due to what is usually taught in a differential equations class. I found that I most enjoyed my time when I read through the book and learned about them. Some of the problems in the problem sets were fun too. But it always felt like the course was intentionally trying to limit this enjoyment.<br/><br/>Only other good thing I have to say about this class &#x2F; the teaching staff is that Mustafa was a great TF and is a cool person. Also, it is currently the last week of finals period and we still are missing two quiz grades and a problem set grade. The revisions for these assignments are due a few days from now, and the grades are still not released.</td>

It was a horrible experience because of grades being returned extremely late, the deadlines constantly shifting, and office hours adjusting not properly. Overall, the content is good, organization needs to be much much better. If Robert is teaching the class again, email him and ask if it would be better organized the time you are taking.</td>

It started with us being told we would get handouts every class, quizzes every two weeks, and a homework every week. The homework’s and quizzes were continually late to be released, making it impossible to plan around. We never got a handout past the first day. There were no grades returned for a month at a time, which is significant because revisions are offered on assignments with a two week turn around. You cannot revise or tune you work style &#x2F; proofs to the grading rubric without feedback. Robert would always make promises he could not keep, and eventually just forced us into working up until the last day of finals to make up for the lack of grading cadence. Great efforts but incredibly poorly executed. Like the worst I’ve ever been a part of. Good material though if you can manage to care enough to retain it.</td>

He really spend hours on preparing this course. Including preparing the lecture, writing materials (sections, homework).  The course will let you know enough about the ODE and PDE. <br/>If you are a student who is interested in quant finance, learning this course will let you be prepared for solving option&#x2F;future pricing that may needs some ODE&#x2F;PDE skills.<br/>Overall, I highly recommend taking this course!</td>

Most assignments were returned at least a month after they were submitted. Additionally, homework was often released late (and not clearly written) to the point that our due date schedule was shifted from Wednesday to Friday (making it so that there were no office hours the two days before the pset was due) and an entire pset was never assigned. Quizzes were also released late, so we only took 5 of the 6 quizzes that were listed on the syllabus.<br/>This course was extremely poorly run, so it taught me a lot about how to stay on top of all my other work so that I could rearrange my schedule at a moments notice to do work for this course. It also only covers through separable PDE’s, so if you are a Physics concentrator and taking this to learn about PDE’s, it’s not worth it. You cover almost the same amount of ODE’s and PDE’s in 15c and 143a.</td>

It, in fact, was far worse than I ever could&#x27;ve imagined. Here are a few of my issues with this course:<br/><br/>&ndash;Terrible grading system: No number grades were assigned, but rather letter grades (N, L, R&ndash;, R, R+) which seemed quite subjective. Despite Prof. Haussman promising at the beginning of the semester that grading guidelines would soon be released, they never were, and it seemed the grades were assigned with the roll of a die.<br/>&ndash;Prof. Haussman was consistently ~5 minutes late for lecture, and lecture consistently ran over. Additionally, content that was essential for the week&#x27;s problem set was often rushed and taught in an incoherent fashion in the last few minutes of lecture<br/>&ndash;Prof. Haussman consistently lied about when assignments would be released and graded. There was one instance when a problem set was released 2 weeks later than he said it would be. He rationalized this by saying that he was being &quot;lenient and understanding,&quot; when in reality it was sheer disorganization, and proved to be burdensome to most all who took the class. Additionally, we theoretically have the option do do &quot;revisions&quot; on every assignment, but as I am writing this, the 6 most recent assignments still are not graded, yet revisions are due tomorrow night.<br/>&ndash;Problem sets were next to impossible to complete, and even if you did know how to complete them, they would take ridiculously long. They took probably 20 hours on average, and each hour was painful. I had to work on a problem set for several hours while on vacation abroad during spring break. <br/><br/>Unless you want this class to consume your life inside and outside of class, I would not recommend taking it if not absolutely necessary</td>

Do not under any circumstances take this class (with Robert Haussman) unless you absolutely, positively, HAVE to take it to graduate. The grading system is absolutely abysmal, being inconsistent as best and comically bad at worst. Finals have started and we have no idea how we are doing in the class. Feedback is given extremely inconsistently (if at all), and you are expected to constantly adjust your schedule to accommodate the professors lack of planning&#x2F;organization.  For example, during the last week of class, we were given two assignments that were supposed to be posted almost two weeks before, and expected to get them done in 4 days (while dealing with other final projects). Haussman routinely promised us in class that our assignments would be returned that night, only for them to be given back a week later with no communication at all. We were consistently lied to about deadlines and assignments, to the point where we couldn&#x27;t even trust guidelines that were in writing on canvas. Finally, class would consistently start late (Haussman would show up 4&ndash;5 minutes late pretty much every day) and end 6&ndash;8 minutes late (if you have a class on the other side of campus right after, you could expect to miss significant material if you left on time).</td>

The material is great and useful, but the way the class was taught was awful. He is extremely unorganized and unprepared to teach. Lectures were generally proofs that weren&#x27;t directly useful, deadlines continued to be move back and work wasn&#x27;t returned on time.  Class would always start and then end 10 minutes late. Problem sets were so long, and you needed to know MATLAB to complete them (which he doesn&#x27;t really teach). The grading is also so harsh and inconsistent.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_7244cf54-b73f-4ffb-97b8-d7997e4b92b1">TL;DR: If Robert is teaching this, please read below. <br/>Every other class I’ve ever taken at Harvard has had a syllabus released with dates on it, and these dates were when exams happened and when problem sets were due. For some reason even after attending years of college and graduate school Robert did not seem to understand the concept of a syllabus; although he included problem set release and due dates, they were rarely correct, and he did not include dates for any of the six exams in the course.<br/>Robert got behind in the beginning of the semester due to circumstances. We had a few problem sets released late due to this. Students were still asking for a full schedule of when quizzes would be (that was missing from the syllabus). We also had not received a single assignment back before taking the first exam and had received one assignment back before the second exam (the graded first problem set that was not the focus of the second exam’s content). We received our first assignment back five weeks into the course, so most of us at this point were past the period during which we could feasibly drop the class. <br/>However, Robert promised us that after spring break everything would be back on schedule. I will note here that Robert blamed some of the delays on him still being in the process of writing our problem sets; although it was his first time teaching the course, he was provided with the materials from a previous professor, and the textbook had numerous problems he could have pulled. I understand the desire to tailor your assignments to your lectures, but if that is disrupting the schedule of the course and you have multiple typos in problem sets each week and your questions are so convoluted that the TF in graduate school frequently is confused by your wording, using resources is a fantastic idea.<br/>At the beginning of the semester Robert announced that we would be using Ed to supplement office hours and ask questions. Ed works great for classes like CS50 and Stat 110, where there are many students and corresponding to them a large teaching staff that is available to promptly answer online questions. However, questions posted on Ed were not answered in a timely fashion, and sometimes completely ignored. Furthermore, when the class schedule began to derail, the student posts on Ed with suggestions about potential fixes to the schedule went unacknowledged. <br/>Other members of the teaching staff (Annabelle and Mustafa) tried to accommodate the students, but frequently this was made difficult because of Robert’s lack of organization; Robert would release section notes or solutions late some weeks, and Annabelle was forced to work through the Monday section notes on her own, sometimes no more than a few hours before she had to teach the material. <br/>At the end of the semester, Robert compromised on dropping the sixth quiz completely, and extending deadlines for the last problem set and quiz window, in addition to adding an automatic revision. However, I would like to emphasize that this retroactive correction was not helpful during the most stressful period of the semester, especially when after releasing assignments late he would not update us until he would speak about it in class. <br/>I do feel that I learned the material well, but whether that was due to this course or due to a strong physics background is difficult to say. As a physics concentrator, I was disappointed with the content that was covered in this course, as well; we spent most of the semester on ODEs, and only reached separable PDEs at the very end of the course. The course description on my.harvard included a brief introduction to nonlinear dynamical systems, which were not even mentioned in class.<br/>I also felt that I was penalized in this class for trying to be ahead on work; I would try to do the problem set before Tuesday office hours, and check it at those office hours, although it was due Friday (because the original schedule was Wednesday due dates and that worked best for my schedule); I would then turn in the problem set, but because sometimes solutions were not yet out for the TFs to reference, I did not benefit from trying to get ahead on the problem sets, even though I felt I had a strong enough understanding of the material to do the problems myself. <br/>Furthermore, two of the four TFs (Leah and Max) did not attend their own office hours, so there were only 5 hours of office hours during the week, two of which were Robert’s and held during the middle of the day when most of the class could not attend. There were multiple weeks where I had to submit a problem set where I may have had one question that could have been answered at office hours, and I showed up to office hours and no TF was there. This was never corrected by Robert, and students just stopped attending these office hours. I suspect the backlog in grading was partly due to the absence of the contributions of these TFs, putting undue stress and workload on Annabelle and Mustafa. <br/> I liked Robert as a person, but his inability to stick to a schedule forced me to constantly adjust my schedule for this class the entire semester. I never was able to develop a weekly routine, as he never developed a weekly deadline. Furthermore, the workload that he found unmanageable and fell behind completing could have been remedied if he had substituted in book problems on problem sets, or allowed other course staff to help grade our exams.<br/>** Finals period update:<br/>At the beginning of finals (when this course was supposed to be long over according to the syllabus), we were still missing three quizzes and five (?) problem sets; the last quiz was not graded until three hours before the deadline to submit revisions, and although he said he would automatically increase the grades, he did not make this clear to people both who had final exams and who did the revision before he said that was not necessary.</td>

Lecture is just spent proving theorems and not really knowing what the point is. Even though section is optional, I would really recommend attending&ndash;&ndash;those were the most helpful for learning. I understand that Robert had a lot going on, but it was really difficult to have so many moving dates and assignments returned so exceptionally late. Revising work to improve your understanding and relieve the stress of getting everything perfect the first time is a wonderful idea, but it was so unhelpful to get assignments back over a month later when the topics were by then irrelevant or practiced so many times that you really wouldn&#x27;t make the same mistakes. There was a shortage of office hours, so the psets took forever. The quizzes were also usually too long to finish in time.</td>

This class probably has one of the best lectures at Harvard (Robert doesn&#x27;t assume people are from the same background, so he was always patient and detailed when he explains things), but also one of the most poorly structured course I have had so far.

The psets are long, but very rewarding if you are interested in the material. If you are taking the course just for requirements, don&#x27;t be annoying to the people that want to learn by saying the material is too hard and should be made easier.

Our last quiz was during the last week of classes, and quiz revisions were due at 5 pm on the last Friday of finals period. However, grades were released after 1 pm that Friday, when many people had exams, travel plans, or were in different time zones, and Prof. Haussman only announced that we didn&#x27;t need to submit revisions three hours before the deadline. Prof. Haussman is a kind person, but is super difficult to reach outside of class or office hours and is very uncommunicative about course logistics. For instance, the course&#x27;s grading scheme (converting from R&#x2F;R&ndash;&#x2F;L&#x2F;N to letter grades) has still not been released to us despite Prof. Haussman having promised to prepare it in the beginning of the semester.
