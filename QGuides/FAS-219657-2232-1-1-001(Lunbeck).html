Readings were manageable and relevant. Lectures usually got out fifteen minutes early and Prof Lunbeck is so kind and a good lecturer. The TF staff is also nice and understanding. I learned a lot about psychotherapy and the ways it has modernized overtime. I didn&#x27;t know much about therapy before this course, and this course really helped me get a better understanding of therapeutic methods and ways that therapy portrayed in shows and movies and more. The midterm was chill and similar to the practice questions done in section, but you need to study and know how to recognize which therapeutic method is being described and explain it according to the scenario. The final is also very creative and flexible, but definitely give yourself time to think of an idea and spend time planning it because doing it last minute could ruin your grade, it is easy to get a good grade but very few assignments so make sure you really do each assignment and study and do what is asked.
