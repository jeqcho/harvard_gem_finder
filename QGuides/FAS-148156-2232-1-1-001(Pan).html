I thought the content she had created for AM 207 was really interesting, but my experience ended up being disappointing with CS 181. This is partly due to the Harvard way of teaching survey courses where breadth is valued more than depth and partly due to very practical things that could have been improved about the course. By making lecture attendance optional and section attendance mandatory, all the work of actually teaching the course was delegated to the TAs. This was in addition to their responsibility of writing (and grading) most assignments as well as class notes. Though they did their best, there were frequent typos&#x2F;errors which they were rushing to correct all the time. This does not make for the best learning experience. Meanwhile, we were watching recycled lecture videos (from two different courses) presented out of order. When there were no pre&ndash;existing lecture videos for a given topic, none were provided. It seems like there really could be more of an effort in teaching this class. You really, really don&#x27;t need to take this class. You can learn a lot of the non&ndash;linear models in further depth in the CS 109AB series. You can learn supervised learning in a much more intuitive way from econometricians, and unsupervised learning is taught in an excellent way in STAT 181.</td>

However, take note that a lot of the challenges in the class this semester were not from the content, but from the structure of the course. As someone who attends every lecture, this is probably the first time in all of my classes I would say going to lecture was not worth it. The first half of lecture was a restatement of the big&ndash;picture &quot;flipped classroom&quot; videos we were assigned to watch in advance, and the second was generally an in&ndash;class exercise that I had no motivation or incentive to do because we were not required to complete it and there was no immediate feedback. I learned way more by going to section and office hours and working through the homework assignments. Grading experienced significant delays and I had no official way of knowing if I knew any of the material going into either exam. I would say I taught myself around half the course going into both midterms, especially the second since we were not expected to complete the homework for the fifth unit (which we were explicitly told not to do due to it increasing grading time) until after the second midterm, by which point it would have been unnecessary to do. Thankfully, the course materials were excellent and I was able to learn how to handle Markov Decision Processes and the like, but only within literally one day of the exam. I definitely learned a lot in this course, and I liked that the assignments emphasized the mathematical and statistical background that often gets overlooked in these types of classes. However, I think the course went through a rough patch this semester, which hopefully will be addressed with experience. If you want to do machine learning after college, don&#x27;t let this class stop you.</td>

She goes above and beyond to make additional material and resources for students, and the flipped classroom format makes it easier to go through the trudgy math by yourself and then clarify high level ideas and theory details together (no more getting lost in the whiteboard math!) This is a great intro into machine learning and you’ll be challenged to understand the material far deeper than you’d thought possible.<br/><br/>I took this class alongside stat111 and the overlap made it easier to cross reference materials.

The pre&ndash;lecture materials, which were the primary study tool with the flipped classroom format, were outstandingly lazy, being pulled from a collection of her other courses so that each set of notes had different notation, philosophy, structure, and purpose. The examinations were also completely unacceptable—I do not have an issue with them being long, but I do have an issue with rampant inequity in administration, with the professor offering her room egregious extensions, unlike the other students.

Seriously finding the good teachers and going to their OH will make such a huge difference; I wish I had done so earlier in the course. Also, make sure to go quick on the exams. I took my time on the first one and didn&#x27;t do 1&#x2F;3 of it despite understanding the concepts pretty well; on the other hand, when I rushed on the final with a similar amount of preparation, I finished every problem and did very well.

This course is more theory heavy than code heavy; I did a lot more math than coding, and we don’t implement every single model that we covered in class. ML is one of the most satisfying applications of statistics that I’ve seen, featuring a lot of creative and nice mathematical algorithms––after taking this class, you’ll be able to code machine learning models that perform very nontrivial tasks, like recognizing handwritten numbers or playing flappy&ndash;bird.<br/><br/>The most important prerequisite for this class is Stat 110––almost everything in machine learning uses statistics uses machine learning, so make sure to have a solid foundation in probability. Math 21a&#x2F;b are also important to understand the mathematical derivations; 21a is important for optimization (trying to find the “best” model), and 21b is important for efficiently manipulating data (which usually comes in the form of vectors and matrices). CS 51&#x2F;61 is not a hard prereq, and the programming in this course is not particularly difficult compared to these two courses. The class is taught in python.<br/><br/>I took Stat 111 concurrently with this class––around the first 20% of the two classes overlap, so I did sometimes feel like I was taking the same class, but the content does branch off as the semester progresses.</td>

However, it was pretty useful learning the math derivations behind the models to gain a more comprehensive understanding of them since before I had only focused on the coding portions. With my background, this class was manageable but for someone without as much STAT&#x2F;CS background it might be a lot because the course is fast&ndash;paced and covers a lot of topics. It&#x27;s nice that the homeworks were biweekly and reasonable in terms of time and difficulty, but the exams were hard because they were long and there weren&#x27;t many practice problems. This course has a good balance of math and coding (both of which aren&#x27;t too difficult), but the math is pretty uninteresting and tedious, which made this class a little underwhelming for me.  In terms of structure, this course was relatively unorganized (received grades very late, things weren&#x27;t posted on time, material was all over the place, confusion about grading&#x2F;attendance policies). I didn&#x27;t like the flipped classroom style because although the pre&ndash;class material was clear and easy to understand, it felt like the lectures themselves weren&#x27;t a good use of time.

It goes over just enough math that you need to have a thorough conceptual understanding of what you are doing and understand the tradeoffs of different choices you make when you build different types of models.  This is very helpful for building models that are optimal for the context at hand, and provides you a lot to think about when doing machine learning in different contexts, as well as how to evaluate how your model is performing and consider the impacts of different choices you made.  (Note that I was doing machine learning research to build a model for applications to neuroscience as I took this class, and used everything I was learning in order to build better models that the biologists in the lab I was working with could use, as I better understood what sorts of choices I could make, how these impacted the model, and how to evaluate model performance in order to improve it).  <br/><br/>Regarding problem sets: while you may be able to solve many problems independently, I&#x27;d still recommend taking this class with friends&#x2F;people you can work with, as this will give you a better learning experience.  Make sure to start psets EARLY, as office hours get crowded towards the end, making it hard to get help for questions that you are stuck on, and there&#x27;s just not enough time to squeeze a 2&ndash;week problem set into 1 without significant stress.  I tended to start all my problem sets early, and for the most part, did not find this class stressful!<br/><br/>Additionally, things have a jump in difficulty around EM and ELBO.  Make sure to review all sources of information to get a solid grasp of this concept starting from when its first introduced &ndash;&ndash; this means use the textbook (this is such a great, undervalued resource for all of the material across the course!), lecture notes, office hours, etc.</td>

Because the lectures focused so much on ethics, this iteration of the course covered significantly less material than previous years, so I feel like I learned less than I would have if I had taken this course a year prior. Due to the flipped classroom style, students simultaneously enrolled in the course had no access to actual lectures (classroom sessions were not recorded). Students with accommodations tested in the same location as students without accommodations for the exams, so a bunch of students without accommodations stayed with the accommodations students and got extra time during Midterm I. The professor then blamed the students for being upset at course staff over the midterm timing discrepancies. During Midterm II (the final), some students were in a room that received 90 minutes, other students were in rooms that received 75 minutes as intended.<br/>The professor is a wonderful and caring person, however, this was the most disorganized non&ndash;tiny course that I have taken at Harvard thus far.</td>

The course is very ethics intensive (relative to most other CS courses at H which spend a day at most), but this is done seamlessly.

There is a strong emphasis on the math that makes these models work under the hood, so you should be comfortable with probability and statistical ideas. Stat 110 is probably enough to prepare you, although there are some ideas shared with Stat 111 so it may be nice to take that as well if you are concerned. You are also asked to implement many of these models from scratch in each problem set, so don&#x27;t expect this class to be focused on applying Tensorflow to various problems.</td>

It was mostly taught in a flipped classroom style, although this changed in the last couple of weeks.<br/><br/>The thing about this class is that it is the only intro to ML class at Harvard.  As a result there are tons of people taking it coming from many different backgrounds.  Weiwei really put in a lot of work to make this course edifying for everyone, which I appreciate, but I just think it is hard. For me, as somebody with a fairly strong math and stats background, it always felt like the course was shying away from the math and the stats and the rigorous reasoning behind things, which could be a bit frustrating. However, I still learned a lot, and the course staff tries to create many opportunities to dig deeper into either the mathematical side, or into the practical&#x2F;ethical side of things.</td>

Instead of teaching theoretical and applied machine learning, most of the course focused on the ethics of machine learning, the theory being sprinkled in&ndash;between. Ethics are important, but no one enrolled in this course just for that. WeiWei is a very bad lecturer &ndash; her informal style gets tiring and annoying very quickly, and for someone who reminded us every lecture about their math PhD, it is ironic that she barely presented any math in the lectures. This course could be improved by actually teaching students something during the lecture. The flipped&ndash;classroom format was a joke: half of the lectures didn&#x27;t have in&ndash;class exercises, and for those that had them, the exercises consisted of compiling code written by the course heads &ndash; basically, students didn&#x27;t need to do anything, be it theoretical or code based. Moreover, the course didn&#x27;t cover as much material as it did in the previous years. Overall, I strongly caution against taking this WeiWei and in the current format.

I still think that it was a pretty decent class: I feel like I got a pretty solid foundation in ML, and I feel confident talking about basic ML concepts and models. I also think a lot of people hate on the course a little too much; while it certainly had flaws, it was clear that (a) some of the course issues were related to having a new instructor take over an existing course (which I wouldn&#x27;t wish on my worst enemy), and (b) it was so clear throughout the course that every single member of the course staff was really dedicated to cultivating a positive learning experience for students, even if there were a few hiccups along the way.<br/><br/>Lectures varied in their usefulness; oftentimes, the pre&ndash;lecture videos covered the same (if not more) content than lecture itself (though sometimes more interpretation was given in lecture). Section was pretty useful for gaining better intuition and rigor. Problem sets and the practical were probably the most effective part of the course for me; they helped put theory and application together and really helped solidify my understanding of and intuition for the material. Exams at face value were not terrible; in fact, they seemed more than fair for a standard intro ML class. But they seemed to focus on different parts of the material compared to the rest of the class (i.e., more calculations, less interpretation).<br/><br/>Would recommend going to section on a regular basis, working through the midterm skills checks, and watching the pre&ndash;lecture videos in their entirety.

I disagree with this idea. I think that the class could use some work in terms of the communication between the students and the teaching staff. Because of this lack of communication, expectations were unclear. The difficulty of exams&#x2F;material being covered was not what we expected. I think the reason for this was because this was the first time that the course was being taught in this newer flipped&ndash;classroom format. I don&#x27;t see this being an issue in the next iteration of the course.<br/><br/>But the class was extremely fair. Weiwei taught the material well, and that same material was covered in problem sets, practicals (projects), and exams. The only issue was that the class wasn&#x27;t exactly sure at what depth we should be understanding the material. This is something that could be clarified and worked on next semester.<br/><br/>I recommend taking this class if you are interested in ML, as it covers a wide variety of models with different applications.</td>

In 181, I genuinely learned so much about the optimization that different models do to make predictions and the many ethical questions ML students must take into account. But I do feel, after a semester of 181, that I am still quite unfamiliar with implementing the models we learned about in Python with libraries the way standard industry data scientists would. I also spent a lot of time questioning why we did certain math problems because they lacked immediate applicative value. In addition, this course had no final project, so I ultimately felt like I learned a lot of the theory and math, but didn&#x27;t have any real projects&#x2F;implementations to show for it. <br/><br/>Also, the grading was quite slow this year (though it was the first year of Weiwei teaching, so I understand).</td>

With that in mind, here are my thoughts:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>&ndash;&gt; Weiwei is very obviously super passionate about the topics, and the topic videos&#x2F;slides&#x2F;content are generally pretty good in my opinion.<br/>&ndash;&gt; The Beyond Sections (like once or twice a week there are extra sections with guest speakers or interesting, above syllabus content) sounded cool and seemed like they had some really interesting and relevant speakers (European Space Agency, WHO, something UN related, ocean cleanup stuff and more, I don&#x27;t remember all of them but lots of cool stuff)<br/>&ndash;&gt; TFs generally ran pretty good sections I believe<br/>&ndash;&gt; 6 PSETs, with one drop, is pretty generous. TFs also will fully allow you to check your answers to see if you have done things correct (not sure I agree with this as the way to go really, as it tended to push you to just somehow scrap your way to an answer a TF got, but I think partly I don&#x27;t like it because I was lazy and didn&#x27;t go to OHs much, so I never really got to check my answers and that caused me stress that others were sure that they were correct, while I just checked my work carefully. That&#x27;s on me though)<br/>&ndash;&gt; Most of the content is pretty interesting, neural networks, Bayesian models, EM algorithm and more were all pretty interesting.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>&ndash;&gt; I hated the flipped clasroom setup of this class. I mostly watched the videos and then didn&#x27;t go to lecture, the videos were fine but lecture didn&#x27;t seem particularly valuable (sorry Weiwei, I mostly mean in terms of learning the content, the videos or other methods were more effective&#x2F;time&ndash;efficient for me and most I think). This isn&#x27;t particularly engaging, and at points I just couldn&#x27;t be bothered, would wait until I started a PSET and would look at slides to try to piece together enough info to solve questions, which isn&#x27;t really the way to do this but without an incentive to go to lecture (i.e. make it cover the content more rigorously, rather than it be a kinda eh review of the videos and lots of getting sidetracked into other stuff)<br/>&ndash;&gt; No OHs or sections on weekend made me sad. Would I have gone? Actually yeah, I think I probably would&#x27;ve gone to weekend OHs.<br/>&ndash;&gt; Didn&#x27;t get great feedback on stuff generally, and never saw or had any idea how or why I lost points on the midterm.<br/>&ndash;&gt; Weiwei seemed very inconsistent with OHs (not that I ever went to these), but often saw people ask on Ed whether her OHs were on, and a couple of hours later being told that they had been re&ndash;scheduled (after people had potentially travelled to SEC and wasted time). I get that life gets in the way at times, but communication on this didn&#x27;t seem good and I feel like I saw it happen on Ed like at least 5+ times this semester.<br/>&ndash;&gt; Exam preparation materials were not great in my opinion. Some practice questions, but not many and we weren&#x27;t provided official solutions (instead gien a google doc to crowd source solutions). This was kinda improved for the final but still wasn&#x27;t great. Shoutout the two TFs who made 4 practice questions, with solutions, for each exam, your content was the highest quality exam review content we had, so we all appreciated that a lot.<br/>&ndash;&gt; Code gives completely different results on different OS. If you are like me and suffer on Windows, then the &#x27;check with TF&#x27; strategy for any coding question basically doesn&#x27;t work, as most of the time, even if you have identical code, different OS give different results. Kinda out of the course hands, but I wonder if life would be better with a CS61&ndash;style standardized Docker environment configured. Would save people a lot of pain with inconsistent solutions, package dependency and version issues etc.<br/><br/>This seems pretty harsh, and it probably is because I didn&#x27;t really enjoy the course that much, however I still appreciate that it wasn&#x27;t for lack of trying. I do believe the TF&#x27;s and Weiwei care about making the course better and I hope it will be better in future iterations, but for this year I wouldn&#x27;t have recommended this course.</td>

I&#x27;m not sure how much of all of this is because of the way CS 181 works or because of how Weiwei was teaching it, and I believe Finale is returning to teach the class next year, so take all of this with a grain of salt. As someone with a fair amount of background in ML that I had picked up on my own here and there, I took the class because I wanted to learn the basics of (statistical) machine learning well and rigorously rather than diving straight into a more specialized class like 229br. I&#x27;m not sure if that latter hope was fulfilled.  On the one hand, I think it did a good job at introducing us to a wide range of different approaches and techniques in machine learning. Weiwei&#x27;s lecture videos were great at giving some intuition for different techniques and provided nice, graphical examples that were complemented by more technical notes. On the other hand, the class felt disorganized at times, grading was slow (but ended up being very generous), the p&ndash;sets were surprisingly short, a large emphasis was put on interpretation of models and results (which is certainly useful for applied work but can also be derived more generally if you were to do the math really well), you had to rush through the midterms, and the course schedule (including assignments and how much they affected your final grade) were changed throughout the semester, sometimes at relatively short notice. The level of technicality and rigor varied greatly from topic to topic: for some (like Bayesian inference), it was sufficient to know &quot;that it&#x27;s difficult and a few reasons for why it&#x27;s difficult,&quot; for others, like the derivation of the ELBO, we were only asked to explain the derivation steps rather than be able to derive them, and for the universal approximation theorem of neural networks, the provided link to the proof required a lot of background in measure theory which I believe made it inaccessible to most people in the class. So overall a decent class, especially if you haven&#x27;t had a lot of prior exposure to machine learning and&#x2F;or are interested in applied machine learning. If you&#x27;re really into the math behind statistical ML, you might be better off with a class that uses ESL as its textbook or just by reading ESL for yourself.</td>

On the flip side, you&#x27;ll learn some cool topics and probably get better at statistics. Based on what I&#x27;ve heard though, I am not convinced that this is a better&#x2F;more useful class than the alternative at MIT. Study hard for the exams!</td>

Assignments were very unorganized, grading took forever, and lectures were completely useless. I still think most CS concentrators should take this class, but note that it is far from perfect (as is most of the Harvard CS department).</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_ae56323c-3418-4119-b57c-1ae6e2d35783">I realized that machine learning is not magic but instead quite straightforward mathematical inference. It was cool to see the different approaches to model building. I learned about different ways to construct, interpret, do inference for, and derive properties of machine learning models. Weiwei&#x27;s emphasis on interpretation, intuition, and high&ndash;level understanding of models I think makes the most sense in an overview course like this. It is what you will remember and what matters when you attempt to apply this. Attend the generous instructor office hours and follow the study guides for exams.</td>

Prof. Pan is very enthusiastic about the course and the material, but the organization of the course made things very annoying and unpleasant. <br/><br/>Long response: I will first give my negative reviews, and then positive (to end on a positive note)<br/>1) There was practically no grading&#x2F;feedback in this course. We only received grades once so far (this review is written before the 2nd midterm) so I have no idea how i did on psets 3 and later. <br/>2) The flipped classroom format was very ineffective: You need to watch lecture videos before each lecture and learn the material and then in lecture, it is basically Prof Pan talking about things and her opinions. Lectures were very ineffective in this format since they were not very precise. However, there is 5% participation extra credit (which is a huge amount) so you might want to go to lecture even if you hate it, which is a waste of time.<br/>3) Some of the &#x27;ethics&#x27; in the course was really sloppy and not very thought well. For instance, one pset had a &#x27;impact question&#x27; about clustering, and the question involved counter factual data about GPAs of different genders. <br/>4) Some TFs seem like they don&#x27;t know the questions on the psets really well, and this creates confusion when you receive conflicting responses from TFs.<br/>5) There were in general a lot of small things that were negative experiences in the course, which created a negative sentiment about the course. This was very clear in lectures &amp; section, and made the experience unpleasant at times. <br/><br/>Now, let&#x27;s talk about the positives<br/>1) The material selection was quite good. There was a lot of focus on stats, but the course touched on a lot of the concepts in ML, which is great if you want to take more advanced courses. For instance, we covered frequentist and bayesian linear regression, neural networks, probabilistic vs. non&ndash;probabilistic, latent variable models (generative models), PCA &amp; clustering, graphical models, Hidden markov models, and some reinforcement learning. I feel much more confident about pursuing more advanced ML after the course.<br/>2) Section was great. I went to Skyler and Charu&#x27;s section, and they were very clear in their presentation of the material and the delivery was very structured. This is important if you are learning the material for the first time, because structure makes it easier to understand the connections. They also derived all the math, which you will need in the midterm.<br/>3) It is clear that Professor Pan puts a lot of effort into the course. I feel like a lot of the negatives were because it was her first iteration of the course, and I am sure it will get better in the future. The course can be great if the organizational issues are solved.<br/>4) There is a lot of focus on conceptual learning which I appreciated.</td>

She clearly put a lot of effort into this course&ndash;&ndash;her materials were wonderful and really helped me learn, she held many, many office hours (5 days a week) and made herself available to support students, her flipped classroom structure was really helpful in providing an opportunity to ask questions, and in general I felt that Weiwei did a lot to ensure that students were having a positive experience in CS 181.  I appreciated the emphasis on machine learning concepts and the choices and assumptions we make in machine learning and their implications, and less on rote memorization or tedious derivation and computation.</td>

I understand that the class was a bit disorganized, but I took a lot away from the class and never felt overly stressed. The flipped classroom structure led the in&ndash;class portion to be a bit of a waste of time, but the lecture videos + written notes were well done and useful. Psets were well&ndash;written and helped me learn the material. The material itself was not too difficult—you really just need basic Stat 110 and calculus knowledge. I concurrently took Stat 111, which was definitely a lot more organized, but I preferred the content of this class. Exams were a bit tough to finish in the allotted time, and there were some problems with the administration of the exams (unfairly giving some groups of students more time), but the problems were very fair. The practical was also graded pretty nicely. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend taking this class!</td>
