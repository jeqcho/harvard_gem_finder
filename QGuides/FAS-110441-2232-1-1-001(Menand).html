This is not necessarily a bad thing, because if you don&#x27;t like a book, you don&#x27;t have to spend more than a week on it, but it might also feel sad at times. 4) Your experience depends a lot on your seminar professor. If you get along well, you will probably have an amazing experience. It&#x27;s still good even if you don&#x27;t, and most professors are great, but the seminars are really what makes this class unique.</td>

You get to learn from truly wonderful TFs and professors in a small seminar setting, and even if you&#x27;ll probably have to bear with a couple of unavoidable section kids along the way, the sheer breadth of the course means you&#x27;ll definitely encounter a text of two that you&#x27;ll want to learn more about, which is a great thing to have as a first&ndash;year! There&#x27;s community in the class if you&#x27;re looking for it, but if you&#x27;re content with engaging with the readings, that&#x27;s also definitely doable too. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve heard anyone say they regret taking Hum10 &ndash; it&#x27;s more so people regretting not taking it &ndash; which I think is good enough reason to take it!</td>

As someone who like reading classics, I enjoyed the course material, but I can also see how someone who does not like to read classics can suffer. I think the course load (essay&ndash;wise) is hyped up a bit, but there is a lot of readings. Reading a book per week means that you cannot really dive into most of the book. I didn&#x27;t realize that is an issue for me until later in the semester when I find no satisfaction in just reading instead of analyzing what&#x27;s going on. Your seminar and writing lab experience also entirely depend on your peers, prof, and TF.

Hum 10 is often so focussed on the texts themselves that the actual essay&ndash;writing Expos element is overlooked, meaning that many students leave this class still with a very limited understanding of what is required to write a college&ndash;level essay. No matter what you tell yourself, it’s almost impossible to actually read a book every week, specifically books at the difficulty level of Hum 10; those books are so thick and especially when you’re trying to juggle three other classes plus extra&ndash;curriculars, it’s honestly not doable. If you really love literature, and if you really love Ancient Classics, then go ahead &ndash; but you’ve been warned, it’s not going to be easy. I would especially warn students who have never studied any Ancient Classics before to stay away from this class.

I say all of them as in every single one of them. I think if you have the impulse to take Hum 10 this class will resonate better than expos. Having said that, the readings are different in the spring (some like it better, some less) but the class definitely goes by a little faster (spring semester does in general). Hum10 made my freshman year more interesting and reading 20+ books is always a plus, so I would say go for it regardless of how this class feels tailored to the top humanities students from prep schools. Teaching staff changes too, and the vibes of the class will be different. You already took 10A, you&#x27;re almost there, and it gets easier (papers are lighter and you can make a fun creative project!). The final exam is not impossible, and feels the same as 10A, but they may try to make it very cryptic to the point you roll your eyes (it&#x27;s mostly term identification, passage identification&#x2F;relevance, and a few short essays, nothing crazy).

The lectures were all fantastic and focused more on close readings than biography which I also liked. Trying to read the Iliad at the end of the year with 22 books already theoretically read was a bit of a stretch but the concession of a necessary 6 or 7 books for the plot was nice. Studying for the final made me realize the course is extremely valuable and I have learned a lot. I also want to recant a statement I made in the 10a Q guide about a harsh curve I think they made the essay grading a lot nicer this semester, especially for the last paper which had a creative option. Not sure about the final yet though.</td>

The quality of lectures can vary quite widely between lecturers and works but if you try there will definitely be something to learn. The readings are quite heavy and frankly at times unrealistic. You will eventually learn to get by but you will definitely finish the course wishing you had more time with each book. Rather than thinking of it as a normal literature course, think of it as a sampler.</td>

I took hum10 because it sounded like it would be super interesting, but conversations lacked depth very often and the final exam is unnecessarily stressful.</td>

I feel like we learned a lot about the academic contexts of the texts, but also we learned about how to let a book change your life and how to interpolate information that comes into play in your wellbeing, spirituality, relationships, etc.<br/><br/>Be prepared to read a lot though! If you read the books you will be perfectly fine, but if not you will have a horrible time with finals! Expect to read up to like 500 pages a week, including less &quot;fun&quot; stuff like philosophy and historical essays.</td>

That said, do not be stubborn and refuse to quit if the first semester isn&#x27;t for you. The second semester only gets harder and increases in workload. The works are rewarding. but challenging, and the professors, as always, are excellent. Just be aware of how much time you should devote to each book while signing up for other classes. Otherwise, you will fall behind.</td>

It&#x27;s no fun if you don&#x27;t (as someone who did the reading first sem and not second sem). That being said, first semester has better books than second.</td>
