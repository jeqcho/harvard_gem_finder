The material was fascinating, and they did a great job of applying dense chemistry concepts&#x2F;(in my opinion) boring mechanisms to really cool biology (drug treatments, enzymes, etc.). I actually wanted to learn the material  &ndash; and there was a lot of material to learn &ndash; because it felt relevant and exciting, which I think is necessary in a course where a large portion of students are taking it because it&#x27;s a premed&#x2F;department requirement. However, the grading rubric for exams was very nit&ndash;picky and not always well communicated in advance. For the first two midterms, the majority of the points that were taken off were because I did not yet understand the many points that would be deducted for small errors. This was the most frustrating part of the course, and grading expectations should be very clear if grading will be as specific as it was.<br/><br/>Tips for success in the course: do not be scared if Chem 17 was a nightmare (it was for me) &ndash; this does not mean that you cannot succeed in Chem 27. This is a lot more bio&ndash;chem, and everything made a lot more sense to me as soon as I saw the interesting bio applications of the chemistry we were learning (actually so cool!). When I saw it as something useful for me as a scientist&#x2F;future doctor, I became much more motivated to study and actually learn the material. Start studying well in advance (like over a week). Do as many practice problems as you can (there aren&#x27;t that many provided, so this is very doable). Get an ARC tutor ASAP and meet with them once a week to go over questions about material that come up as you work through pset, and then twice during weeks with midterms. Having something scheduled forces you to do psets&#x2F;practice problems&#x2F;practice exams in advance so you have enough questions to fill the hour. Be very nit&ndash;picky with yourself as you grade practice exams; they will take off a point or more for those &quot;small&quot; mistakes that you think don&#x27;t matter and think you can ignore in your overall studying. Memorize. The. Mechanisms. Like right after they teach them in the lecture. Mechanisms are the bulk of the points on the exams, and you can get a solid grade just by learning the mechanisms and nothing else. Understanding the application&#x2F;short answer questions will come later. YOU GOT THIS!</td>

I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the teaching staff, the way information is presented, the bio aspect of it, or the fact that I was better at organic chemistry than I was when I started 17, but I felt 27 was much more manageable and even found myself enjoying what we were learning sometimes. That being said, the class is still a lot of work. They teach something new pretty much every lecture and to stay on top of it, you should pretty much be reviewing content every week so that you&#x27;re not cramming when it&#x27;s time for exams. Sections and section handouts are your best friend for practicing and when it comes time for exams, make sure to do every practice exam and understand all the problems. I&#x27;d say lab was the most irritating part of this class. I appreciate that lab TFs were pretty hands&ndash;off in terms of letting you handle your own experiments&#x2F;materials during lab (unlike in other lab classes) but the lab assignments (pre&ndash;writing already written procedures for each pre&ndash;lab) and the super vague yet harshly graded post&ndash;lab questions were a drag every week.

The best tip is to go through every section handout, every lecture practice problem, every pset, watch review videos, and do little cheat sheets of the mechanisms so that you can begin to familiarize yourself with them. literally so as many many manyyyyy practice problems as you can and take the practice exams 3 days before the exam so that you have enough time to go to office hours and review your mistakes. If you want to take practice exams like a real one you should but I never did and I feel like if you prepare enough you should be able to take them like real exam. KEEP IN MIND that practice exams were always harder than real exam which is a very good thing because you walk in more prepared for the real one. Please take the PSets seriously and go to office hours because you should be learning throughout the semester and not right before the exam. Do the section handout completely the weekend before your pset is due and go to office hours for questions on the section handout or email your section TF, this will make sure you stay on top of studying and not leaving everything until the last minute. CHEM 27 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; CHEM 17, I PROMISE! You can do this but just make Chem 27 your priority this semester if you want to do very well, do not let it slip past your mind. Also keep in mind that you have a midterm drop so try to do the best on the first exam because it has the least amount of material in comparison to the other ones. If you take one thing from this is to do the section handouts and understand every problem, with that you will be fine.</td>

They actively discourage and destroy the instructor&ndash;student bond. It very heavily disillusioned me to to what courses are at Harvard and how professors view students. <br/><br/>Over the duration of the course I had a life changing family situation arise which impacted me mentally, emotionally, and financially. This was a huge point of struggle for me, but I decided to put my head down and try to work my way through it. I had a few stumble points in my schoolwork when I felt that I had to put time into my family over my education. ALL of my courses EXCEPT Chem27 actively and encouragingly gave me help with balancing this. I ended up being missing one of my PSET due dates due to my familial situation. I had used my previous PSET drop due to an error on the course calendar about when the PSET was due. So, due to a ridiculous course policy clearly geared towards bureaucracy instead of the valuation of education, I would be getting an automatic 0 for that PSET. After communicating my situation to the head course staff (who took weeks to respond to me) I was met with the response that I could only get a PSET drop through DAO intervention, as per another poorly thought out course policy. Stem courses are notorious for their dehumanization of the instructor&ndash;student relationship, but this course took it to a whole new level. After weeks of communication with my Resident Dean and the DAO (with many still unanswered emails which were sent to head course staff) I felt burnt out, in worse mental health, and wholly baffled at the lack of human respect and the complete disregard this course pays to the instructor&ndash;student relationship which is meant to inspire learning. Inspiring learning means helping students who are struggling in a course. Inspiring learning means having human understanding and compassion for a student&#x27;s difficult situation. Inspiring learning means setting aside ridiculous policies dictating automatic 0&#x27;s for any late PSET in the face of a valid excuse. I understand that it can be difficult to run such a large class. But in a similarly sized class, CHEM17, there was still a form available which could allow PSET and lab drops for extenuating circumstances with Resident Dean intervention. Another large course, LS1B, allowed for excuses by simply working with a TF. These classes are large, but at some level (less so for Chem17) value learning and understanding at the end of the day over blind adherence to dated course policies.<br/><br/>Every student knows that truly magical and influential courses can stick with you forever.

However, the teaching staff is really good and the psets are graded on a scale which makes them very manageable! My biggest piece of advice would be to start studying for exams early and take notes on the lectures after class. While the lectures were good, I found it really helpful to go through the lecture notes again after class to really cement the material. The class is a lot of work because it meets so often and there are quite a few weekly assignments to stay on top of. However, it&#x27;s a good class and I would totally recommend to fulfill a premed or concentration requirement. Also, don&#x27;t be scared if you didn&#x27;t take chem 17!

I highly recommend the 17&#x2F;27 series. It counts for 2 semesters of organic chemistry and one semester of biochem combined into only 2 semesters. CHEM 17 is where most of the heavy work is done (e.g. learning the basics of aldol, retroaldol, Claisen condensations, nucleophilicity and electrophilicity, iminium condensation, hemiacetal&#x2F;ketal formation, orbitals). CHEM 27 just takes that knowledge and applies it to biology. Learning the amino acids isn&#x27;t bad at all. The mechanisms are also simple to remember after enough practice.<br/>It is crucial to know the chemical reasoning behind mechanisms. Remembering key terms like eclipsed&#x2F;staggered, R and S stereocenters, hyperconjugation, antiperiplanar, etc. really comes in handy. It will help understand why and how reactions happen, as well as the requirements for E1cb, decarboxylation, and more. The slides at the end of lectures with the diagrams on enzymes, what Km is, what the properties of inhibitors are, and what happens in the electron transport chain of metabolism, for instance, will show up on sets and exams.<br/>Psets are graded holistically which is amazing. I didn&#x27;t have to stress about doing a mechanism perfectly (I didn&#x27;t have to worry about getting a point off for forgetting a formal charge, for instance), and I would go to office hours instead to ask questions about chemical explanations behind a mechanism or for tips on how to approach a question rather than just to check my work (which is often done in other classes).<br/>Exams are alright. The real ones are not as bad as the practice exams, but the practice exams have highlighted for me before what content I should look at again. On the actual exams, there are some questions about the biological&#x2F;chemical reasoning for things, and although individually they might be worth at most 5 points, they add up to make a good portion of the grade. Thus, knowing how to explain the rationale for a mechanism is needed.<br/>Lab is chill. They made it so much better this year (only 2 hours 45 minutes instead of 4 hours in previous years). I think they want to distribute the 9 labs between CHEM 17 and CHEM 27, though, so that will be interesting to see. Some TFs are stricter than others, but overall it was fun. Make sure to hydrate well before going in because there will be many smells that could be hard to take in without having drunk water before. Also be very careful as there are so many dangerous chemicals (they indicate them in the manual beforehand). GO to office hours to check your answers for the lab report because these are not holistic, but usually they are not too strict grading either.<br/>Section handouts are sooo helpful. I still think watching the lectures and going through lecture notes are the essentials to doing well, but if you missed something (maybe you didn&#x27;t think it was that important) and it is in the section handouts, take note of it!</td>

This makes it easier to stay motivated when the grind gets tough. <br/><br/>This course requires a frankly anal level of detail&ndash;orientedness to do well on exams. Read mechanism guidelines!!!! or get ready to get points off for forgetting the most menial stuff :&ndash;( Annotated lecture notes are a game changer if you&#x27;re not someone who can listen for an hour fifteen like me.

I wish I had put more effort into learning how to problem solve these kinds of questions (active site binding, inhibitor mechanism) but frankly the only explanations I could get at office hours was &quot;it works this way just cuz&quot;.<br/><br/>Most importantly, don&#x27;t let this course beat you up!!!!! I frequently had a crisis of feeling like I wasn&#x27;t cut out because of how put together everyone else seems, feeling like I wasn&#x27;t working hard enough even though I would study for like 40 hours the week of the exam, or feeling dumb because I couldn&#x27;t get everything right on exams.

Start the psets early, though. Start studying early !!!! Overall, it is so much better than Chem17, and I highly recommend you take this directly after taking it because it references a lot from that course and uses some of their abbreviations.
