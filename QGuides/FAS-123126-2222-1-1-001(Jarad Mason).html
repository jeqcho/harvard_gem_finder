Lectures don&#x27;t involve many problem&ndash;solving examples, so definitely go to OH to clear up misunderstandings. However, even though attending OH is a must, TFs vary greatly in explanations and problem&ndash;solving approaches, which can exacerbate confusion.  More consistency in explanations and problem&ndash;solving approaches across TFs would thus be invaluable. On the topic of course materials,  psets, pset keys, section handouts, and exam practice problems are often not released in a timely manner (i.e. for psets, &lt;1 week before the due date), alongside assignment feedback (which can take anywhere from a few weeks to a month to come back). Course materials oftentimes do not contain all the needed information to solve problems, and keys oftentimes consist of typos. Problem sets and exams don&#x27;t always accurately reflect material covered in lecture and section. Sections aren&#x27;t always helpful&ndash;&ndash;they dive into problem&ndash;solving rather than offering a brief recap of what was covered during that week (as a form of review, which is a typical format in many other classes here). I think the teaching staff want to help you do well, but given these aforementioned challenges, expect this class to be a struggle :&#x27;(</td>

His lectures can sometimes be dry but if you go to office hours, he&#x27;s really accessible and clearly explains problems and can give you problem solving tips that will be very very helpful on the midterm (you won&#x27;t learn these tips during class so DEFINITELY go to office hours as much as you can if you want to do well on the exams!!) Definitely also very strong community, but that may have been formed out of necessity. Cons: The course suffered from lack of organization (something that can easily be solved by designating a TF), where Canvas files such as psets or practice were never posted on time, and office hours were sparse. A lot of the material on psets wasn&#x27;t taught in lecture and either was taught in section, office hours, or could only be learned through reading the textbook. Normally, textbooks are not great for learning chem but a lot of students turned to the textbook out of necessity for this class. Above studying, GO TO OFFICE HOURS &#x2F; READ THE TEXTBOOK BEFORE EXAMS SO YOU CAN LEARN THE LITTLE NUANCES THAT&#x27;LL BE RELEVANT ON THE EXAM.<br/>TL;DR: Prof Mason is great, but this class is poorly organized (could not be more different than the organic chem classes at Harvard).</td>

Professor Mason is very kind and understanding of student&#x27;s struggles, but because of how course content was presented and not often reviewed&#x2F;cemented, if any concept was unclear then many following concepts would be nigh impossible to keep up with. If you are comfortable with chem concepts and can follow along well, this course will definitely work but be aware that you must stay very on top of readings and psets because falling behind will make every new concept exponentially harder, and the class never slows down.</td>

Do not come in with the same expectations that you did for Chem 20&#x2F;30. Imagine a triple Venn diagram: one circle for lectures, one circle for psets, and one circle for exams. In an ideal class, these three circles will come together and have spaces of intersection. In this class, all three circles are completely disjoint. While the professor has office hours at night, TF office hours are very inaccessible if you are taking other classes (which you most definitely are). There are 4 TFs, and a total of 2 office hours&#x2F;week. TF office hours were Wednesdays 1&ndash;2PM and Fridays 12&ndash;1PM, which are both very popular times for other classes. Sometimes, the TFs even forget about their office hours and don&#x27;t show up. The TFs can also be condescending and often give wrong information. For example, if you are able to go to office hours and ask a TF a question about the pset, they will answer it. When you submit that pset with what the TF said, there is a good chance another TF will mark it wrong. Clearly, there is no consistency between the TFs. Psets also introduce material that were not taught in lecture or section. When people would ask questions on Slack about Pset questions that were not taught in class, the TFs and professor would not respond.  Sometimes when they do respond, they will just tell you to refer to your notes. The textbook and the Internet are your best friends, and at times, the TFs&#x2F;solutions will tell you something completely different from what the textbook&#x2F;Internet says. The solutions are also often full of errors, so be mindful of that. Professor Mason’s lectures are good, and he goes at a fairly slow pace, which is nice when you’re learning new material. But because of his pacing, we were unable to cover all the topics mentioned on the syllabus. The poor organization of this class really made me lose interest in inorganic chemistry. They still graded us as if this was material we already knew. There are not that many practice problems available for exams, and they are released only a few days before exams. This class really needs a lot of improvement, and I hope the course staff takes the feedback seriously. I would not recommend taking this class unless it is a requirement.</td>

Take this class with Jarad, he creates a welcoming and comforting environment, he is incredibly intelligent and helpful, and he&#x27;s one of the sweetest professors around. I also learned so much more and appreciated the material so much more taking it with Jarad than my friends did taking it with someone else. If Joy Cho TF&#x27;s this class again, try to attend her section and get to know her! She&#x27;s the most joyful, relatable, kind, and helpful TF I&#x27;ve ever had. <br/><br/>You should be willing to put in the effort for this class. I spent probably 15 hours a week on this course, which is a lot more than I expected coming in. But I can certainly say that every minute spent was worth it – learning and understanding the material was incredibly rewarding. (The 15 hours might be biased towards the long end though, as I came in with less pre&ndash;requisites than required).<br/><br/>I can never say enough about how much I love this course, and I can never say enough about how much this course single&ndash;handedly changed my academic path. From gaining a deeper appreciation of chemistry itself, I finally decided to change my concentration to something more chemistry&ndash;oriented. And from watching Jarad lecture and Joy teach section and help at office hours, I finally realized that what I really want to do is to be like them, a teacher with all their amazing qualities :). <br/><br/>Take this class!

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_cf21dea3-eb56-4c2f-8500-25bd476e03a4">The first major issue of this course stemmed from lack of organization&#x2F;teaching experience. PSETs would often not be posted in time and students had to ask for basic materials (such as practice problems for an exam). PSETs wouldn’t be graded on time, due dates were always changing, and we would learn material on a Thursday for a PSET due Friday (there were also no office hours). One quote from the Slack channel that stood out to me from the TFs was “We weren’t originally planning on having office hours, so we’re still trying to figure out scheduling them.” This was in the second week of classes. I’m not sure what led TFs&#x2F;Professor Mason to thinking office hours weren’t a part of holding class? Additionally, the limited office hours were usually around midday meaning they conflicted with anyone who didn’t have a completely open course schedule. The TFs also didn’t respond well to questions in the chat with Lisa often writing “consult the textbook.” Isn’t it the course staff’s job to answer questions? Sometimes the TFs would just mention in the chat “I’m having office hours right now” without any warning or schedule. Furthermore, the class *did not have an updated syllabus.* Professor Mason thought he would see how it goes on a lecture by lecture basis and the syllabus would be updated after lecture. This meant we didn’t receive assigned reading until the class covered the material. Additionally, it is my understanding that Harvard courses are required to have updated syllabi. I believe MANY of these concerns could be solved by having a head TF, as one of the major issues was a lack of accountability. There would often be “bad problems” as TFs called them in sections that didn’t make sense. The answer key for midterm 2 practice problems wasn’t released until two nights before because the Professor and TFs disagreed on the answer to a question—if they can’t agree&#x2F;teach the material in a concerted fashion, how can we learn the material effectively? This was further illustrated by one TF writing incorrect messages in the slack (such as Rahil writing NH3 is a strong field ligand). <br/><br/>Another issue related to teaching experience was that “teaching” in lecture often consisted of the easiest example of a type of problem. Rather than teaching us material we would work through an example and be left to draw false conclusions to other examples. In order to succeed in this course, the only way was to attend Professor Mason’s office hours on Tuesday nights. For example, one could not solve Tanube Sugano diagram questions without his OH. This was particularly difficult for questions on lasers which had no accompanying reading. This is because TFs often hadn’t previously consulted the PSET (they would say this to us) and struggle to answer questions. The most frustrating aspect was that TFs would often say we wouldn’t need to know something (example bond order on midterm 2) and then it would show up on the exam. The sad thing is TFs would often say we didn’t need to know something when they lacked understanding. <br/><br/>Additionally, there was very inconsistent grading on problem sets and exams. Students would compare very similar problem sets or exam questions and have very different scores. This was frustrating because in certain sections the TF would not provide specific feedback (only a score would appear on canvas ~3 weeks after submission if at all). If you also wanted your grade for a PSET you would have to ask your TF a few times. <br/><br/>The final major issue stemmed from the attitude of the TFs (I don’t blame them I think this was a combination of some not having experience and understanding what it means to teach a Harvard course as well as outside stressors). When asked about problems&#x2F;answer keys riddled with errors, TFs would cite busy lab schedules and an inability to make time for the class. They also said Professor Mason’s lab is run similarly to the course in terms of disorganization—I draw from this that he needs serious training to begin teaching again or running a lab. Also, whenever students mentioned they were having difficulty the TFs would respond “we are moving much slower than in years past.” The speed of learning material doesn’t have an impact if it isn’t being taught effectively or there isn’t sufficient support from the staff. Or, when one TF couldn’t answer a question in the section they mentioned they needed a few minutes to look at the question because they hadn’t looked at the section hand out prior to arriving to teach it. I empathize with the TFs as they said it was a very stressful semester due to the disorganization. However, this is not an excuse to patronize students for not knowing material that wasn’t taught to us, being unresponsive in Slack (the preferred method of contact) for days because it wasn’t convenient, or a need for students to drive psets&#x2F;keys being posted into canvas. Some TFs also rarely attended lecture and their disconnect from course material was apparent. <br/><br/>I&#x27;m not sure what my grade will be in this course also, so I wish you best of luck. I think for the next couple years avoid this course if Mason is teaching it. He&#x27;s really nice and could be a fantastic professor—until he gets more training though it&#x27;s an awful experience.</td>

Jarad is really nice, knowledgeable, and means well, but this class was so disorganized it was almost laughable at times. During the first week of this class, the course staff shared that they 1) didn&#x27;t exactly know what they planned on teaching in the course, and 2) weren&#x27;t even planning on holding office hours. The lack of organization was the biggest downfall of the class. And that doesn&#x27;t even touch the material. Some of it makes sense at surface level and some doesn&#x27;t, but you are expected to know and memorize literally every detail taught during lecture (and lecture is just 75 minutes of new material, twice a week for an entire semester). There is not enough time to actually sit down and work with the material until you actually understand it. All it was was a few pset problems (that usually had material on it taught on the day before it was due, or sometimes the following week??) and like two problems during section. Otherwise, you are all on your own. Some TFs are hit or miss, too, and would sometimes send me to the unreadable textbook to try and figure out something that could&#x27;ve been explained in 3 minutes. The exams can be impossible too, with questions that make no sense, or tested something that Jarad had mentioned once for like 5 seconds during lecture then never came up again in psets or practice problems. Not to mention, there were never enough practice problems for these tests. All in all, this class was so miserable when it did not need to be. Kids who took the class last year had a much easier time even though the content was still hard, if slightly different. I really wanted to enjoy the class, but I just couldn&#x27;t.

The teaching staff was often late not just in grading homework but also in posting homework solutions (as well as solutions to section problems). Several times they did not post them until after someone asked about them on Slack. That being said, I think I learned a good deal in this course. Things might be different for you, but we were given two pset drops, and they dropped the lowest midterm. The second midterm was exceptionally long, most people couldn&#x27;t finish, and the mean was in the 50&#x27;s.

You might want consider self learning the materials and take advanced inorganic chemistry instead. The greatest pain I have with this course is that things go slowly in class, where some concepts are not fully explained, and there are a lot of unexpected surprises in psets and midterms. The midterms do weigh heavily in this course (20% each) and the final 40%, so I often feel anxious about how well I have mastered the material to pass the exams. Speaking of that, in this iteration of chem 40, there&#x27;s also surprisingly few feedback. The TFs won&#x27;t hand back graded assignments mostly until after 3 weeks or more have passed, and I often didn&#x27;t have the chance to review my graded assignments before exams, but have to resort to the answer keys directly, and I felt that was a bit annoying as well.
