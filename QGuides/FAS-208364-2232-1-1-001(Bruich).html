It feels more like a real&ndash;world and statistical class than an economics class, which I think is a good thing. The labs aren&#x27;t very difficult and are graded pretty easily. The Empirical Projects are a bit annoying and tedious, but also graded leniently. The exams are a bit tricky since they are relying a lot on memorizing specific studies and slides from the lectures, but they&#x27;re not bad.</td>

Take it if you are interested in learning about recent research in economic mobility, racial disparities, health, or climate change through an economic lens.  Raj Chetty provides a pretty good overview of all of these topics, and covers a lot of recent research. Through labs, you can learn a bit of R&#x2F;Stata programming, which can be helpful if you want to work with data in the future. The methods and techniques we cover in lab are also used in the real world and it&#x27;s quite interesting to use them yourself. It&#x27;s also not a lot of work outside of lab and lecture, so a nice chill class if you need one.</td>

However, this course goes so much further in exploring all aspects of societal issues that interconnect with each other to a certain extent and I believe will make me overall a better person and future physician. I highly recommend Harvard&#x27;s Economics 50 course to anyone who wants to gain a solid understanding of how to solve social issues using data and science. It was an enriching experience that not only expanded my knowledge but also helped me think more critically about the world around me and how to improve it for the better.</td>

I want to say that the lectures consisted of findings that Prof. Chetty and other researchers have found. During lectures, we would learn of the design of a specific experiment. The lab that week would then make us practice using that concept with an example. You will be working with actual US data and you will be able to analyze the inequality you see in a region of interest to you. <br/><br/>This class, I believe, is the best introduction to the economic research side of economics. There is almost no discussion of interest rates or monetary policy. The topics discussed are thus more human and down to earth. You will understand the effect of neighborhoods, schools, teachers on kids&#x27; income. You will learn how to analyze the effect of class size on kids. How do you assess the risk of patient? When creating a program, how do you analyze the benefits and drawbacks of your method? How can you tell if your policy succeeded? <br/><br/>No background necessary. However, as a CS grad, I found the class very easy. For those with technical skills: realize that this class is more about the content than the technical skills. This course will not teach all of R or stata and you will only get a brief overview of many subjects. This is great for an intro survey class (the aim of the class). But, if you want depth, then this is not for you. <br/><br/><br/>In terms of assingments, every lab is easy. In the beginning, when you are learning your language of choice, the labs will take upwards of 5 hours. Gradually, it will decrease as you get more and more accustomed to the language. After spring break, there is a little bit of python that is introduced and it is basically you going through each line of a preprepared python document, trying to understand what is going on. If you don&#x27;t care, you can literally run the code with minor changes and your lab is done. There are two significant assignments. The empirical projects (part 1 and 2) take a while and since the class is generally very laid back, this assignment can catch you offguard. If you look at my time spent, you will notice two extreme increases in time spent. These are the weeks that the project was due (parts 1 and 2 respectively). Also looking at the data, notice that the empirical project in total took around the same time as the total OF ALL LABS COMBINED. Do not delay emp. project like me and do it as soon as possible. <br/><br/>Midterm was easy. Quoting Dr. Bruich: &quot;The mean was 24.4 out of 30 with some students scoring 30&#x2F;30.  The standard deviation was 3.2.  The median was 25 out of 30. There were 63% of the scores within 1 standard deviation of the mean.  There were 97% within 2 standard deviations of the mean.&quot; Hope this helps. <br/><br/><br/>Ultimately, if you are interested in social equity, education policy, health policy, and solving social problems with data, this is for you. For humanities oriented students: this is also a great way to dip your toe in a semi quantitative class without it overwhelming you. <br/><br/><br/>Good luck with the class!</td>

The topics are really interesting and its clear that effort has been put in to make this a really enjoyable and not too difficult course. Best advice is to try to finish labs during the lab time (you can probably get 80%+ of it done then) and pay attention in lectures. I found that if you really just listen, you&#x27;ll absorb the key ideas tested. There are some tricky questions on exams that ask about details, but the majority of the exams cover key themes&#x2F;results found and applying the modeling tools you&#x27;ve learned (sort of like the science section on the ACT). Also super easy to watch lectures 1.5x, 1.75x is also relatively comfortable.</td>

Especially if you have no coding background going in (like myself), you&#x27;ll feel a little lost decently often, because the weekly labs are totally code&ndash;dependent. Sometimes a lot of the necessary code is given to you, but there are definitely moments where you just won&#x27;t know what to do if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with general coding practice. Anyway, once we&#x27;re past that, the course material is pretty cool&ndash;&ndash; Raj will explain to you just how much big data has modernized traditional ways of collecting economic data &#x2F; measuring things like upward mobility over generations. Sometimes the content does get boring, but it&#x27;s accessible and pretty easy to download over the course of the semester if you show up to lecture. Empirical project is pretty rough but doable, midterm and final are very fair.</td>

Most lectures consist of going through another incredibly impactful study that he did&ndash;his research is so important and used in various places right now to create&#x2F;advocate for change, and understanding the processes behind them is amazing! If you have a background in CS you will manage to finish labs within the one hour 30 minute lab time slot, which is amazing. Even if you don&#x27;t have a coding background, the TFs are incredibly helpful and a lot of the code is given to you so that sometimes you only have to change a few variables and you&#x27;re done with the lab. The most intensive parts of this course are the empirical project and the exams, but the course is said to be graded pretty easily in order to encourage students to take classes in unfamiliar fields, so overall it should be okay if you do relatively well on the project and exams. TFs are definitely the highlight of this class and really do care for the wellbeing of students, but profs Raj Chetty and Greg Bruich are also wonderful.</td>
