The class is definitely not free of both ups and downs — you&#x27;ll have weeks where you&#x27;ll pat yourself on the back for a speedy (8 hour) pset submission and other weeks where you&#x27;re struggling over a pset at 5:30 am (after the rest of the night doing the same) in the Math Library. Despite the emotional rollercoaster the class provided, taking this class is the best decision I&#x27;ve made at Harvard so far. The community that you gain from taking this class is incredible — almost everyone I know in the class has found their new best friends within it (including most of my blocking group).<br/><br/>One thing I will say is to make sure that you don&#x27;t get behind. The best weeks I had in the course were when I proactively sat down in the library for a few hours and spent some time poring over the course notes or the textbook to supplement lectures because the class goes very fast. It covers the equivalent of Math 113 and Math 131 in the span of one semester and if you don&#x27;t spend time to make sure that you&#x27;re gaining the knowledge without holes, you might not understand things later on. So, approach with caution but also if you spend the time needed, you&#x27;ll do great.<br/><br/>tl;dr: Take this class if you like math and want to do more of it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</td>

The lectures are delightful and the psets are fun and there were plenty of OH to goto to get help (especially because everyone stopped going). <br/><br/>But don&#x27;t take it if you feel like you won&#x27;t have time to really think through the material. Grinding out psets for the sake of finishing them can get tiring and I think that will only make you hate Maths. If you do have 20hr+ to spare per week, though, TAKE THIS COURSE. I have had some of my most enjoyable moments in my life working on 55b material.</td>

It is definitely easier than Math55a. <br/><br/>(If you consider taking other very time consuming classes at the same time you&#x27;ll probably manage to do well in all of them, but be aware that you will not get as much out of 55 as you would by making it your main class.)</td>

I never thought of myself as one of those super smart IMO kids (got up to around AIME) and never took anything above Calc BC before coming to college (since my school didn&#x27;t offer college math). <br/><br/>If you are thinking about taking this, just go to some of the first few lectures and see how you do; the only thing stopping most people from taking this class isn&#x27;t inherent mathematical talent but the vast quantity of time it will take. Don&#x27;t be afraid to ask your peers and the CA&#x27;s for help, and if you put in the time and effort, you will be rewarded with good grades—the CA&#x27;s are pretty chill with grading and the fact that the final is a take&ndash;home is a really nice bonus. <br/><br/>Do be warned, however, that this class does take a lot of time.

If you didn&#x27;t take 55A, you can still take 55B, and there are definitely a few people that actually do that! In particular, it seems that a lot of physics people who still have some appreciation for abstract mathematics can succeed in the class: topology and complex analysis can be topics that are somewhat easier to wrap your head around (compared to, for example, abstract algebra in Math 55A).</td>

Maybe you will need to spent a lot of your time doing the assignments, maybe you will need even more time to go into the depth of things alone, and maybe you will have a lot of sleepless nights. Yet, through all these things there will be people near you, people you will be come close to you, people you might become friends with for all the next years. And this is what counts the most, making the Math 55 experience  truly great!

If you took Math 55a you are most definitely prepared to take on this class. We also had I think about 4 students from Math 25a and 2 students from Math 22.<br/><br/>Based on my experience and other friends’ feedback it feels that Math 55b was a decent bit easier than Math 55a and that in some sense last semester was the “real Math 55 experience.” Last semester we were forced to work together on hard problems for a long time and go to office hours for help, and as a result, we formed a close community and had a deeper understanding of the materials. To some extent this semester we had the continuation of that community but personally, I felt like I understood last semester’s material better and had more interactions with the CAs and just everyone in the class.<br/><br/>This course is titled &quot;Studies in Real and Complex Analysis,&quot; but on the first day of class, the professor explains to you that in reality, it is more like Math 131+Math113. We roughly had three units: 3.5 weeks on point set topology, 3.5 weeks on algebraic topology, and 5 weeks on complex analysis. As a result, we don’t really dive into real analysis and students should learn this important area of mathematics on their own at some point.<br/><br/>We followed Munkres’ Topology through the first two units. In point set topology we learned about fundamental concepts such as product and quotient topology, connectedness, compactness, and separation axioms, which is Munkres chapter 12&ndash;34. So I would recommend future students who want to do some preparation during winter break to read this portion of Munkres. This part of the course was comparably more intuitive and chill (admittedly compactness is not very intuitive).<br/><br/>In algebraic topology, we learned about homotopy equivalences, fundamental groups, Seifert&ndash;Van Kampen, covering spaces, and briefly introduced topics like higher homotopy groups and homology. This is roughly Munkres chapters 51&ndash;57 and 79&ndash;81. This part of the course was quite difficult for me as it is harder to visualize and see the significance of these constructions. Later on, after learning complex analysis, I was finally able to see some of the motivations and applications of these concepts. Definitely try to go to office hours here, for me at least the problem sets involve a degree of hand waving and many drawings.<br/><br/>About a week after spring break we started Complex Analysis, which according to Professor Harris is his favorite and most beautiful part of the course (as usual Joe is an absolutely fantastic and supportive lecturer). Here we followed Ahlfors’ Complex Analysis, which honestly is quite terse and hard to understand (reading lecture notes beforehand helps). We started with holomorphic functions and with the introduction of the Cauchy Integral Formula we were equipped to take on harder problems. After learning about poles, singularities, and Laurent series, we did a good amount of Residue calculus which gave us important results about holomorphic and meromorphic functions.<br/><br/>I have to admit, I personally did not find complex analysis to be particularly enlightening as it felt like learning a ton of cool formulas and then just applying them to solve some seemingly arbitrary problems. In retrospect, I actually liked the topology portion of the course better as they introduced new ideas I have never considered before. I will likely take Math 231, a course Professor Harris highly recommended.<br/><br/>From my perspective my classmates took the following courses alongside 55b: quite a few took CS 124, a decent amount took Stat 111, some took Math 123 or 129 or 132, and a few took CS 181.<br/><br/>Throughout this semester I have been thinking hard on what the point of taking Math 55 is. If a student took courses that taught the materials in 55 separately they may get a deeper understanding by virtue of spending more time on them. I have come to a few humble conclusions: I think by compressing a large amount of abstract mathematics into each semester we do get a slightly more surface&ndash;level understanding of individual topics. However, at the same time, we got to see some connections between different areas of mathematics that would be otherwise hard to see, for example, algebra with topology, complex analysis with algebraic topology, abstract algebra with linear algebra; and I’m sure some of the smaller topics we did like the exposure to basic category theory will serve us well in the future. I think I got a very solid overall “feel” and overview of higher&ndash;level mathematics. <br/><br/>Moreover, 55 is really at its core about the community. I have met some of my closest friends and some of the most interesting people through this class. The late nights at Math Lounge and Math Library will forever be a sweet piece of memory lying in the foundation of my Harvard journey and I’m sure years later my classmates and I will look back fondly on those days and laugh and shed some tears. I highly recommend anyone reading this to reach out to your classmates, schedule a lunch or a walk together and get to know them better. You will not regret this.<br/><br/>Overall I think continuing with 55b was the right choice for me and most of my classmates from 55a. If you are considering this course, sit in on a few lectures and check it out! I wish you the best of luck!</td>

Math 55B has similar breadth, but a noticeably different feeling with the class community and a less intense workload. Math 55B covers topology and complex analysis. The first part of topology is point&ndash;set topology which feels extremely annoying (though not unbearably challenging). Assuming you push through that, the rest of the course is pretty interesting and very well taught.  The workload for 55B is much lighter than 55A (and I say that as somebody who was better prepared for 55A and felt that course&#x27;s content was more intuitive). I don&#x27;t exactly know why the workload is much lighter across the class for 55B because psets are of similar length, but maybe it has to do with having a whole 55A semester of experience. I personally think this class (55B) should be made a bit more challenging by covering some more real analysis. Most of the students that joined the class for 55B were able to handle the workload. The class has already sectioned off into smaller pset groups and the submission policy for 55B also encouraged less whole class community rather than tinier friend groups. <br/><br/>This course is a logical next step for anyone who took 55A and could be worthwhile for students coming from other courses, though I&#x27;d recommend already knowing people in 55A so you have pset partners to work with. Professor Harris is a fantastic teacher who can give effective lectures, generate enthusiasm for the math, and provide helpful feedback at office hours.  If you&#x27;re looking at taking this course, I&#x27;d recommend looking at the Q&ndash;guide for 55A as it&#x27;s very useful. <br/><br/>I want to emphasize that Math 55 was a once in a lifetime math experience that I feel very grateful to have taken. By studying all these topics in one year, there&#x27;s a strong feeling of cohesion across mathmetical topics and one can see how all the pieces connect with eachother. Having this perception has a mathematician is the special imprint Math 55 leaves for future studies.</td>

As a student who switched up from Math22A, the content is definitely more advanced and fast&ndash;paced. However, if you ask for help and pset with other people, it&#x27;s definitely doable! The community of the class is also very supportive and wholesome, so I made quite a few good friends through Math 55 who are super smart and hardworking but also kind and down to earth.

Every lecture you are expected to be familiar with all the concepts taught so far in the course, which is not realistic at all, given that we meet three times a week, that the psets already take us anywhere between 10 and 20 hours, given that the lectures are already confusing and it takes time to review them and ask questions, and lastly given that you also have other courses. Harris is a very kind person in real life, but when it comes to teaching you will feel very stupid because he always says things are so obvious when they aren&#x27;t. You will feel impostor syndrome because the professor acts as if the proofs are so obvious so he will skip plenty of steps, and he will never remind you of any definitions unless you ask, but then nobody asks, because it is not a very welcoming evironment. This class is just unnecessarily hard and time&ndash;consuming. Also we only got feedback for 2 psets out of 10 until the last week of classes when we learned the rest of our grades on the psets and the final, and you also never see any solution of either the psets of the final, so you just hardly ever improve from your mistakes.</td>

Topology and complex analysis are easily the two most opulent and fascinatingly beautiful fields of maths that I have encountered thus far: an absolute joy for visual learners of mathematics like myself yet full of unexpected and powerful results. Professor Harris&#x27; passion for the material, already evident even before the very first lecture, was showcased in its full glory throughout the entire term: the course at times felt like we were being led on a trip by a deeply enthusiastic tour guide through a vast and mysterious landscape with treasures hidden at every turn. <br/><br/>Onto more practical reflections. With regards to what background one needs to embark on this great journey, I would argue that any student who finds themselves to have completed and enjoyed any of Math 22A, 25A or 55A is a potential student of 55B: I have friends in the class who have fallen in each of these categories and they all seem to have had a good experience in the course. What I would suggest for anyone coming into 55B without having been exposed to abstract algebra, however, is to familiarise oneself briefly with the objects discussed in the 55A Group Theory units in order that the lack of this background does not present an additional obstacle for the already difficult task of fully understanding Covering Space Theory, which I found to definitely be the most demanding subunit of the course in terms of the requisite level of mathematical maturity. Another factor I would take into consideration is that the subject of Real Analysis is left virtually entirely undiscussed in the course, which presents the prospective course taker with the motivation to self&ndash;study this by themselves during the winter break through independent reading of Baby Rudin. To this I would say certainly that a familiarity with the different types of convergence could be beneficial, but as Professor Harris correctly emphasises, one must resist the temptation to use Real Analysis as a foundation for understanding Complex Analysis as the latter has a far stronger connection with Topology. As for the problem sets, I have found that a greater proportion of the problems in 55B are written to serve a rigorous pedagogical purpose than those in 55A, which I have found to be very helpful as the problems (and the very&ndash;sometimes&ndash;overly meticulous texts from which they are chosen, namely Munkres and Ahlfors) provide a nice contrast to Professor Harris&#x27; emphasis in his lectures on conceptual intuition and aesthetic appeal of the mathematics. Depending on the specific problem set and one&#x27;s level of comfort with the material discussed, I would say that 14 hours per week spent on 55B is what is to&ndash;be&ndash;expected of the student.<br/><br/>As for the community in the class this year, which from what I have seen has only gotten stronger since last term with the addition of newcomers, it is absolutely stellar. In my experience I have met many friends in 55 who are incredibly fun, caring, inspiring and passionate about maths and other sciences such as physics, statistics and computer science. What I thought was crucial in maintaining this was that all of my friends in 55 (i. e. most of the class) were respectful of each other&#x27;s mathematical backgrounds in high school and recognised that helping each other understand mathematical ideas and collaborating on problems together were way more constructive than gatekeeping knowledge and fueling one&#x27;s own ego through the derision of others. With that said I have great faith that the 2023&ndash;2024 class of 55ers will have nothing to worry about as they will have a fantastic set of CAs who will ensure that this is to&ndash;be&ndash;carried&ndash;forward.<br/><br/>Looking back on my year in Math 55, I am both proud of how much I have learnt this year and grateful for the opportunity to have had this experience. This course has for sure been one of the coolest most exciting things that I have done at Harvard and I hope that you will give it a try and enjoy it as much as I have.</td>

In 55B many problem&ndash;setting groups have formed; there are also students who join the class having taken other math courses in the fall and will join others in psetting, so &#x27;integration&#x27; is done well (irl or complex). My main comment here is along the lines of that for 55A (I will give the short version here): the community and people in the class are a big part of why the class is amazing!<br/><br/> &ndash; Material is very fun. Topology as a subject is simultaneously surprising and intuitive: for instance, the fundamental group of the circle, which we spend serious effort deriving, is a seemingly obvious but beautiful result. Similarly, complex integration techniques are quite nice: we learn Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula, this time very surprising, yet the derivation is clean. I particularly enjoyed the applications of this theorem, e.g. in solving complex integration (e.g., the &#x27;keyhole&#x27; integral) — the methods of integrating around a circle but altering the path slightly for ill&ndash;defined functions was wonderful and enjoyable! Lastly, the class concludes with the connection between topology and analysis, which is a particularly lovely connection and brings the course material together. The 55B topics are probably more intriguing than that of its predecessor (55A): it is often surprising how all of the definitions and foundations leading up to results were conceived.<br/><br/> &ndash; Professor Harris is a wonderful lecturer, as always: he is clear with the main ideas and the course concepts that matter (for instance, &#x27;point&ndash;set topology is useless&#x27; :)). His office hours (very much recommend attending!) are always insightful, in respect to both clarifying course material and going beyond, e.g. in describing the efforts of the remainder of Ahlfors which we do not cover, or in tangents&#x2F;glimpses of category theory, algebraic geometry, etc. — it is quite eye&ndash;opening seeing all of the mathematics ahead.<br/><br/> &ndash; Rigor is occasionally sacrificed in lecture for the sake of understanding. I think the lectures are well&ndash;done in that they make it clear what the main idea is (rather than being jumbled in an analytical mess). However, it I did find it helpful to sometimes look into Ahlfors or work out certain examples myself, in particular regarding issues with continuity, convergence, etc. I found this a good way to complement lecture in that it helps with a complete rigorous understanding of concepts that lecture intuits and explains well.<br/><br/> &ndash; The consensus seems to be that 55B is easier than 55A. Probably, this is true, in that most problem sets can be done by considering the theorems learned in class and applying them roughly directly. In this sense, the 55A problem sets had more engaging problems on average. Nonetheless, there are always challenging problems which are quite fun to do; also, topology is enjoyable to visualize.</td>
