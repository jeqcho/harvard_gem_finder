I would say that it is easy to succeed with work and the teaching staff are amazing, The psets can be long but are doable if you have a good group and&#x2F;or go to office hours. Kelly is an amazing soul and so supportive. It can be easy to fall behind though and many of the concepts are tested on exams so make sure you have a good understanding of the code required and how to explain them. Try to go to lecture if you can. My biggest regret is not attending lecture more!</td>

Also go to lecture! Really helps engaging in person.</td>

Professor McConville is an engaging instructor, extremely dedicated to helping students understand the course material, and is able to teach at a pace that allows a student with any familiarity with data analysis&#x2F;R to keep up with the course. Through the course&#x27;s Slack, there is definitely a sense of a collaborative  community that grows throughout the semesters as students help each other with completing problem set assignments and simply understanding key course concepts.</td>

I took honors statistics in high school and thought I really understood it, but this course made me second guess everything I had learned because it was so rushed and because I felt like I was just learning to go through the motions in R as opposed to understanding each thing that I was doing and why I was doing it. Though I know how&#x2F;when to use some functions in R now, I do not know why I am using them or any other background&#x2F;foundations behind them.

It&#x27;s also not a difficult class as long as you stay on top of going to lectures, start problem sets early, and go to office hours. It&#x27;s very easy to fall behind and half&ndash;ass the psets (which I did), but the exams are very similar to the problem set questions and practice exam questions, so it&#x27;s def possible to &quot;catch up.&quot; <br/><br/>TL;DR: this class is doable and you&#x27;ll be better at R than if you took Psych 1900, so imo, take it if you&#x27;re a premed for whom R would be a useful skill (i.e. for a senior thesis, other research projects, personal interest, etc.)!</td>

Khalila is the best TF, hands down, so try to join her section or take her oral exams with her if she&#x27;s free. The problem sets are more so lengthy than hard, so definitely start early.

This class was certainly harder and not an easy A, like PSY1900 is, but I&#x27;m really glad I chose it instead and I think despite the additional work it was a much less painful experience. You can watch the lectures online, there&#x27;s plenty of support in OH to help with the psets, section is essentially just a quick review then time to work on the pset with help from your TF, and the assignments are so consistent. I honestly don&#x27;t care about stats and I actually found the lectures somewhat engaging. By contrast, PSY1900 seemed &quot;easy&quot; in terms of grading but so annoying and bloated, with so many busywork completion assignments due throughout each week and random attendance checks to try to counter its perception as a &quot;gem&quot;&ndash;&ndash;it seemed like such a worthless headache and I would&#x27;ve spent more time complaining about PSY1900 than I spent doing a little extra work and actually learning something in STAT100. This is all to say&ndash;&ndash;if you&#x27;re a psych major or minor who needs your stat requirement, consider taking this class instead of PSY1900! You&#x27;ll have to actually watch the lectures and actually work, but if you have any stat or CS background you&#x27;ll be fine and can probably get an A with a decent but not inordinate amount of effort. I do think people who had never taken classes with coding psets before struggled a bit more, so if that&#x27;s you then maybe ask around and find the opinion of someone who took STAT100 without any coding experience.</td>
