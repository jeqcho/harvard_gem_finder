I came into this class with zero coding experience all all, which is the same experience as most people taking the class&ndash; as it is a GOV COURSE, not a stats course. I did absolutely everything in my power to thrive in this class including getting a GOV 50 tutor, going to office hours every week, doing readings, and doing the pre&ndash;course workshop. None of this was enough to learn R. These psets were created with the assumption that the class knew how to code and would have a fun time figuring out the challenge. This is extremely frustrating and honestly caused the entire class to just take answers from one another without understanding the meaning behind them. When I would ask Yao a question in office hours, he would ask my why I did what I did and then say not quite and walk away. I would then see him having casual chats with students who were good at coding about their classes or concentration. This was and is SO frustrating to someone struggling and trying to learn. Yao actually said to me &quot;this class is just difficult for the gov minded person&quot; after telling me that one of the psets most of the class dropped &quot;wasn&#x27;t that hard&quot;. I am so incredibly disappointed by this conduct. Furthermore, I feel that we as a class were set up for failure if we did not already know how to code. We need to be taught how to code in a way that is structured like a math class. Professor Lo would do an exact summary of the textbook in class with basic examples. However, I know how to read already and can do that myself. When it came to the pset, I did not even know where to start!!! My gov 50 tutor did not know where to start either because the tutors were not given answer keys like they are in many other classes (for example EC10A and EC10B). In class we should have been walked through SIMMILAR problems to the pset so that people who are beginners actually had a SHOT and learning and figuring out the pset on their own. If you do not already have coding experience, you will learn nothing in this class about coding. You will just struggle in office hours every week while being treated like a second class citizen for not intuitively understanding the pset. I did not even know which questions to ask, and I did everything in my power to understand what is going on.  I am a smart person and have the capacity to learn this if it was taught to me.

The class has gone through many teaching personnel changes in the past few years, and this semester they were clearly still working out the kinks in the curriculum and instruction. There seem to be better courses out there to fill the QRD and statistics requirements for the Gov concentration &ndash; I would recommend opting for those, unless there are major positive changes in future semesters to this class</td>

Lectures are fairly interesting. Course gets very quick very fast and you feel like you stop learning, but rather just reurgitate what your TF tells you to do on Psets. In this sense, you stop learning because you are just trying to grind out the Psets.</td>

By the second half of the course, I was lost as we got into probability &ndash; i think the majority of the class had no idea what was going on.</td>

Class was hard to engage in, resources were chaotic and overall pretty unstructured. Each problem set was unpredictable in terms of content and difficulty even though it should be based off the class content that week, you often couldn&#x27;t tell. There are no office hours at the weekend, which (I know for many students) was the only time they were finally able to start the pset. Since the pset was due Tuesday morning, there was only time for office hours on Monday, which is not great for such long psets.  I got the idea of what the class was trying to achieve, enhance our critique and understanding of research projects, but it didn&#x27;t really achieve it.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_612a4050-bac2-4cfe-b3f9-c5201d407dab">This course will be difficult. I was in office hours every week, for every problem set. The amount of outside resources for learning to use R in this course are very limited, and lecture was only helpful during the first few weeks. The course and lecturer did not do the best job at effectively teaching how to actually code using R. It is definitely not an introductory course, especially the way that it is taught. You can be successful in this course, but it will take *a lot* of outside work on your part.</td>

This course is very practical in terms of learning how to navigate R, visualize data trends, compute statistical tests, and run some cool simulations using real&ndash;world data. Many of the problem sets were built around replicating the results of actual social science papers, so you get to put yourselves in the shoes of actual social scientists. You do have to put in a bit of work for this class, especially towards the end of the semester. But overall, I found this course to be relatively enjoyable (even though I don&#x27;t like politics and found out over the course of the semester that I don&#x27;t like the government department). Also, take my advice with a grain of salt, because your curriculum might be entirely different from mine. This class went through a lot of changes recently; the former long&ndash;time professor who taught this course had a history of saying racist stuff, so he was fired and there&#x27;s been a revolving door of visiting professors who have all brought their own unique approach to teaching this class since then.</td>
