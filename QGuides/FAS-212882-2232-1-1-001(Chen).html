Yes, you will NEED to go to office hours (seriously, don&#x27;t skip it). Yes, you might fall asleep in the lectures (I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll work on it next year). But the mode of thought taught in this class, namely how to design your own experiments, and the different techniques you learn (not only the theory behind them, but also practical uses) are unmatched.

If you’re pre&ndash;med but a humanities concentrator and you’re interested in the take&ndash;home assignments and no exams, take this class but take it with a huge grain of salt. Professors and TFs assume you have a vast amount of background knowledge going into the class (from previous classes, from working in labs, etc.) and if you don’t have this knowledge you’re a little bit screwed. But you can still do it! Make sure the teaching staff knows where you&#x27;re coming from so that you can get the extra support you will inevitably need.<br/><br/>&ndash; The homework for this class is reasonable. Assessments are insanely complicated but there are only 4 of them! It&#x27;s doable if you prioritize starting them early. This class is smaller, so the office hour schedule leaves a lot to be desired, and office hours are basically the only way to get through the assessments, so beware.<br/><br/>&ndash; Amie is the best science professor I’ve ever had and the only one to know my name without me introducing myself. She cares so so deeply about the enrichment of her students. SCRB50 reminded me that science can be interesting for its own sake, not just for knocking out premed requirements, and that was a real breath of fresh air. That being said, the flipped classroom lecture design left a bit to be desired. Just know that if you find yourself having trouble paying attention, you always have the internet.</td>

Also, this class is definitely more focused on the applications of biology and experiments involved than the fundamentals itself, which would be good or bad depending on what you&#x27;re interested in.

I can say with guarantee that I would not have passed the class if it was not for my hdrb friends and the senior CAs...<br/><br/>To start off, the structure of the class is very impractical. Students are expected to spend 2&ndash;4 hours a week completing the pre&ndash;lecture and pre&ndash;quizzes before lectures which seems unnecessary. So, all of the learning is independent. The lectures are split between exploration and application which did not prove to be very useful. The class would have been way more effective if the content was presented in the class as this caused many people to underestimate the importance of the pre&ndash;lectures.<br/><br/>The section was quite enjoyable only because of the great TF and CA. Aside from that, the experiments were way too long and it was hard to connect them to the class content if you were not already familiar with the lab techniques.

While this looks lovely, it was absolutely torture:<br/>&ndash; 4 THT are excessive as there was no breathing time between the 3rd and 4th<br/>&ndash; SCRB 10 knowledge makes a world of difference (the 1st one was basically all from scrb 10)<br/>&ndash; the TF office hours were absolutely terrible and Amy made it a point for TF to not help out students<br/>&ndash; You MUST go to CA hours (They are the ONLY people that care about you in the course and host OH from the goodness of their heart as it is not part of the job description)<br/>&ndash; The individual part is timed and absolutely unfair to students who are not familiar with the scientific approach &#x2F; lab techniques presented in scrb 10<br/><br/>Again, this class is completely biased to hdrb students and does not welcome other students or make them feel supported.<br/><br/>While you may think that my biggest issue was with the unfairness of scrb10 basically being a mandatory pre&ndash;req for the class, my actually biggest issue was with the Course Head Amy.<br/>&ndash; She was the most unsupportive member of the staff<br/>&ndash; She actively made life harder for students by scolding TF and CA for helping students on the THT (It is near impossible to do these THT without the guidance of the staff ESPECIALLY if this content does not come easily to you)<br/>&ndash; She was just rude and unsupportive to the needs of students who were unfamiliar with scrb and hdrb<br/>&ndash; She does not take constructive feedback well<br/>&ndash; She had meltdowns in class and OH<br/>&ndash; She was inconsiderate of overlap with chem27 as it affected 90% of the class<br/>&ndash; She made reaching out for help humiliating<br/>&ndash; She also publicly shamed students for giving wrong answers in class polls<br/>&ndash; She made me question my choice to be pre&ndash;med every single day by the structure and unsupportive nature of her class<br/><br/>On another note, Julia and Stephanie were absolutely amazing! All the CAs (shoutout to Stephanie, Robert, and Chinaza) were extremely kind and supportive.

My main qualm with the course is its structure — there are two lectures, on Monday and Wednesday, but before the lecture on Monday you have to complete a pre&ndash;lecture video (which can be 30&ndash;45 minutes total). And, almost all of the content on the exams comes from the pre&ndash;lecture videos. I wish SCRB50 would just have three lectures a week, instead of having us watch videos on Panopto and answer questions, if the &quot;pre&ndash;lecture video&quot; is actually the most important part. The collaborative exams are a HUGE time commitment (they take up the entire weekend before they&#x27;re due, plus more for the individual portion), but are a fairly effective way of learning. I do wish that we&#x27;d have practice problems during section to reinforce some of the main ideas and experimental methods from class, so that we could have some practice with the problems before getting the collaborative exams. The four sets of exams was also frustrating — as the last one was close to the end of class, making it difficult to work on the research proposal ahead of time. This said, the TFs are ALL amazing and extremely willing to help students, or provide feedback on assignments. They laugh through your mistakes in lab and give very helpful guidance.</td>

This class was incredibly difficult and I felt like the only people who understood this class material were those deep in HDRB&#x2F;SCRB&#x2F;life sciences who work in a fancy research lab already. There were assessments every 3 weeks that were so long and so challenging. So 3&#x2F;4 of the exam is take&ndash;home collaborative and you have an entire week to complete it and the last 1&#x2F;4 is assessed independently online via Canvas with a 2 hour time limit. This exam design was stupid to me; the exam questions are tricky and application&ndash;based so this time disparity caused me to do poorly on the independent portion due to the time crunch. It is weird to test for our comprehension under strict time constraints when it&#x27;s clear that you need ample time to think about appropriate solutions for the question &ndash;&ndash; isn&#x27;t that why we were given a week to complete the other portion of the exam? <br/><br/>Overall, exams were difficult and I hated them. You MUST start the exams early like once they release them. You MUST collaborate with peers and friends if possible. And you MUST go to office hours for the exam, it was impossible to understand and answer the questions without OH. Go to as many office hours as you can (even though they were so useless at times because the TFs were ridiculously vague with answering q&#x27;s). Plus, I will say that the hours were so inaccessible. I went to CA office hours because they were 100000000x more useful. But it was frustrating how those were organized infrequently and impromptu with barely any prior notice to students. <br/><br/>While it was nice that they were graded for completion, the weekly lectures and lab quizzes were inadequate preparation for the take&ndash;home exams. And lecture did not help at all either! Genuinely a waste of time. Your best bet at learning anything is during application and lab, but the way this class is designed, nothing discussed will directly translate into useful info you need for the assessment because it&#x27;s application&ndash;heavy and based on real world research. Maybe this will be fun for you, but it was really difficult and unenjoyable for me. Was not fun or interesting. Had virtually no support from teaching staff. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.</td>

However, grading is tough, and this class has become more difficult than previous years. There is not a lot of support in terms of office hours over the weekends especially those held by CAs.</td>

I know you might think it&#x27;s a good pre&ndash;med class but it absolutely is NOT!!!! The course head and TFs aren&#x27;t great or even that nice (they really show their true colors after the add&#x2F;drop deadline has passed). They also aren&#x27;t accommodating even if you have DAO accommodations (I had to get my dean involved just to get an extension on an assignment). WORST CLASS I&#x27;ve ever taken, and I thought LPSA was bad but this definitely wins by a long shot. So many nights spent crying and stressed out because of this class but I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s finally over. Learn from my mistake and avoid this class at all cost (if you decide to take it, don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t warn you). This class also made me realize I don&#x27;t want to be pre&ndash;med anymore so thanks, that&#x27;s the only good thing that came out of this.</td>

The TFs and CAs are amazing and Amie is the absolute best! There&#x27;s not a lot of work for this class (pre&ndash;lecture videos, pre&ndash;lab, and post&ndash;lab assignments), but you should start very early on the assessments. They are very difficult and take a lot of time. You should go to as many office hours as possible and work with as many people on them as you can. If you&#x27;ve taken SCRB10, the material shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult to understand and the question style is very similar. All in all, the class is good and it made me really happy that I declared HDRB!</td>

Lots of people took it without taking Scrb10, but I do not recommend it. I took Scrb10 and still found the exams very difficult. The class teaches you a lot of experimental design and application, the exams were very application based and almost all experimental design. There are no psets, but there is videos to watch before lecture which are long sometimes (with embedded quizzes) and lab reports and pre&ndash;labs. Start the exams early and go to CA office hours, the TFs are not as helpful but the CA ones are the best and work with others. Make sure to review lecture slides before exams and make sure you know the experimental methods (how to do them, what they are for, etc).</td>

There are no psets, but that doesn&#x27;t make this class easy. The four exams in this class are divided into collaborative portions and individual timed portions. The collaborative portions of the exams are like very long and HARD psets. I had to go to 3&ndash;4 office hour sessions for each of the collaborative portions to understand the material. They were heavily application&ndash;based and even if you paid attention in class, you still will not be able to easily do the exam. The individual portion of the exams were timed and VERY HARD. I never fully understood any of the questions on the exam. <br/><br/>The best part of this class, in my opinion, was the lab section. The labs were super interesting and fun, even though they felt long at times. If you liked LS1B labs, these are similar in nature. <br/><br/>Overall, this class is great and I feel like I learned a lot, but it is hard and you have to put in a lot of effort. I&#x27;m a premed and I found this class to be harder than orgo.</td>

Very difficult assessments that require office hours if you want close to full credit or if you haven’t taken SCRB 10. Harsh and nit&ndash;picky grading. The structure of the course covers a lot of material that is super interesting however the take home assessments and lack of psets make the material very difficult to retain with no source of reinforcement. Recommend if interested in the subject matter only.</td>

Most of the information necessary to complete the test questions are from the pre&ndash;lecture videos. SCRB10 is more than helpful as background for this course. Though it isn&#x27;t impossible to take with a basic background in biology, I would strongly recommend having a background in SCRB 10.  I think this class is good if you&#x27;re going into labwork or if you already work in a lab, but the information taught may not feel applicable otherwise. It also feels sometimes like we are just relearning things we have already learned and not branching deeply into new topics from SCRB10 and basic bio.  Also, I feel that the difficulty of the tests was unwarranted and though, by going to EVERY office hour it was doable, this should not be necessary.</td>

The class is a very easygoing as long as you set time to watch the pre&ndash;lecture videos (and I mean actually watch them… don’t just let them play in the background) and start the take home tests in advance. Starting the tests early is very helpful since it gives you time to attend office hours, and the work can easily pile up on the weekend if you delay it. Office hours&#x2F;asking questions are really big determinants of your success in this course.<br/><br/>One somewhat cheesy note: please take the time to enjoy this class. Amie and her team put so much effort into making the class fun, but what that means is that you may feel tempted to blow off lecture and just complete your assignments without giving much thought to the material. Don’t. This class is designed to inspire you and push you towards advancing the field of biology—if you come into lecture with a thirst to learn and ask questions (especially HSCI faculty are speaking), you’ll get more than just a good grade—you’ll gain inspiration and a desire to achieve a high&ndash;level of excellence in biology. Don’t pass up on the many opportunities you have to find your passion in this class.</td>

The assessments are ridiculously hard, even though they are take home. CAs are inaccessible and TFs want nothing to do with you or your questions. Grading is very hard even when the whole class does poorly, there is no curve. Labs are so boring but relatively easy. the research proposal final is also very hard and you have little to no guidance. Amy is nice but is constantly angry that we are doing poorly in the class and that attendance is low (lectures are so boring). take it if you have to i suppose.</td>

The assessments were definitely difficult and very time consuming. I think it is also a good way to know if you might like research as it introduces you to a lot of assays that are commonly used in basic science labs.</td>
