From Stat 110, you know that the chicken will lay Pois(lambda) eggs per month, so you’re very excited knowing you can expect to get lambda free eggs each month! Yay!<br/><br/>But suppose this was the real world, with a real chicken. No one knows the true value of lambda! Instead, we will have to estimate the value of lambda using data––and this is one of the first things that you will do in this course. <br/><br/>In Stat 110, you developed the theory of probability––Stat 111, you’ll apply this theory to the real world, and see how Stat 110 can be very useful. If you took Stat 110, I highly recommend taking this class, since it puts all of the difficult theory you learned last semester into context.

When you read this in the future likely Joe would not be teaching it anymore, I think Neil may be teaching 111 after 2022&ndash;2023.<br/><br/>The material one learns in Stat 111 is a lot more applied than Stat 110, for example sometimes during daily activities I think of things that I can apply Stat 111 concepts on, and I feel confident attacking any more advanced Statistics concepts after finishing this 110&ndash;111 series. The class emphasizes the trident &ndash; theory, simulation, and data, and they do a good job facilitating the understanding and seeing the connections between concepts and real&ndash;world practice in the problem sets. One small caveat is that the lectures and the tests heavily focus on theory while on homework we focused quite a bit on the other two branches, so it is crucial to do all the practice exams before midterm and final to do well in them. <br/><br/>The class had 11 units in total. Before the midterm, we focused on: likelihood function, score function, fisher information, maximum likelihood estimators and method of moment estimators, bias&ndash;variance tradeoff, asymptotic behaviors of distributions and estimators, sufficient statistics, and exponential families. After the midterm, we focused on: regression, hypothesis testing, bayesian thinking, bootstrapping, sampling and resampling, and causal inference.<br/><br/>I took this class concurrently with Math 55b, and I would say it is definitely not an easy class as my friends and I needed to think hard on the problem sets and the tests. The overall consensus is that Stat 110 started off being really easy but ramped up quite fast afterward while Stat 111 started out being pretty difficult and stayed about the same difficulty level through the entire semester. So if one is able to make it to problem set 3 one should know whether to take or drop the course. <br/><br/>I decided to take this course because one I wanted to supplement my knowledge from 110 and get a good overview of statistical concepts, and two this is required (alongside 110) for statistics concentration, concurrent masters, and secondary. <br/><br/>I think the sections are decently helpful, so make sure to check out who fits your vibe early in the semester. Most people needed office hours so make sure to go to one or two earlier in the week. Me and my friends had the unhealthy habit of starting the problem sets on Thursday nights for the first 3 weeks and I can confidently tell you that is not a good idea. I, later on, found a good schedule where I start looking at the problem sets on Sunday or Monday and go to office hours on Tuesdays and Wednesdays so I could check with other people and turn it in on Thursdays. Personally, I did not go to any lectures in person and I found it pretty manageable just using Panopto and video speech controller but I know some of my smart friends did go and they found it useful. <br/><br/>Overall I felt a bit rushed during the semester by the course as they did teach a lot of material at a fast pace. One redeeming factor is that while the final exam was difficult, the frantic preparation I did for it by doing the past final practice exams really helped me review all the concepts and see the applications and connections. The actual final was also quite fun, so in hindsight things make sense and I consider 111 as a very positive experience.</td>

In the psets, you get to work with simulation and real world estimation, which feels good. The course gave me more confidence in my statistical abilities both in the wild and in theory, and made me appreciate the statistics behind the t&ndash;tests we often take for granted.<br/><br/>The course was very organized and well&ndash;structured, with clear themes and “big ideas” that were elucidated upon in a straightforward way.

IMO if you got through 110 you should definitely take this. In fact, I don&#x27;t think it makes sense to take 110 and not 111. A TF put it to me like this: &quot;Stat 110 gives you a hammer, Stat 111 shows you how to use it.&quot; I think that&#x27;s totally right — the 110 material is extremely powerful but I felt it lacked some motivation. In 111, you see why what you did in 110 matters.<br/><br/>Of course, this class is very challenging. If you struggled through 110, you will certainly struggle here. Not because the material is more difficult per se; if anything, I actually think the 111 material is usually a lot more intuitive. But because you need basically everything from 110 — obscure 110 results appear frequently on the PSETs and exams. So it&#x27;s the 110 material + all the new 111 stuff.<br/><br/>Still, though, this course gives such a greater overview of how we think about statistics and uncertainty. Joe frames it as a philosophy course at the start, and I think that&#x27;s right. This is very much not a course about calculating p&ndash;values. It is a course in getting to think about how we understand the truth. Some of the math along the way is annoying but you&#x27;ll learn an incredible amount.</td>

His lecturing&#x2F;teaching style is fairly uniform across his classes, so you&#x27;ll get many of the familiar experiences: exams are difficult but fair, problem sets help solidify understanding of abstract theoretical topics, and the textbook he co&ndash;wrote to accompany the course is really a backbone for the course (though less so than in 110). As expected, lectures are somewhat slow, there will be complaints about exam difficulty, and Joe will spend a solid amount of lecture time going over somewhat tangential topics (though it&#x27;s always entertaining!).<br/><br/>111 builds directly off of 110; familiarity with content from 110 (e.g., well&ndash;known distributions, counting, CLT, LLN) is critical for doing well in the course and understanding the content. If you&#x27;re uncomfortable with the content from 110, 111 is fairly unforgiving – the course assumes you&#x27;re solid on 110 content and uses it without much background. Some of the stories from 110 also return – some problems (mostly on problem sets) assume that you&#x27;re familiar with chicken&ndash;egg, bank post&ndash;office, etc. If you&#x27;ve taken 210, some of the topics will come easier – 111 uses Slutsky&#x27;s theorem, delta method, CMT, and some representation – though it certainly isn&#x27;t necessary.<br/><br/>Taking 111 with CS 181 will also make your life a lot easier – while the two diverge after the second half of the semester, the first half of each spends a lot of time dealing with likelihood functions, MLEs, etc. Definitely worth considering if you want to take both classes.<br/><br/>Overall, a really great class! Far fewer people take 111 than 110, but I really feel that the content in 111 is super important&#x2F;useful to know, and the course is a beautiful extension of 110 if the content from 110 interested you.

However, if you take a year or more off between the two classes it will probably be hard at the start, since Stat111 really relies on the understanding of probability and random variables that you built in Stat110. <br/><br/>This is a rather theoretical class, though Joe does try to keep things applied through R simulations and coding problems that use real data in the problem sets. However, I think that having a strong theoretical understanding of how statistics really works (like what is a p&ndash;value, really?) makes it so that you can look at statistical methods under more scrutiny and think deeply about what you can learn from your data, even in applied problems. <br/><br/>Psets are doable, though time consuming, and it pays to start them early &ndash; really understanding the whys and hows of the concepts presented in each pset will save you a lot of pain when studying for the midterm or final, since the concepts in Stat111 are tricky and sometimes just need time to sink in. And it&#x27;s easy to get help if you need it. Though the office hour and section schedule is not quite as robust as Stat110, you&#x27;ll find plenty of support and a team of dedicated and wonderful TFs to answer all your questions. Overall, I really enjoyed Stat111 despite the difficulty, and think it&#x27;s a worthwhile class that made me better understand how to think like a statistician.</td>

The final seems to be an incorporation of 110&#x2F;111 ideas, so familiarity with 110 is definitely very helpful (A&#x2F;A&ndash; level understanding shld be good). Overall, would recommend this course! Throughout 110, it felt like something was missing and in 111 I feel like the simulations &#x2F; data analysis we conducted filled in those gaps (on psets, questions tend to have many parts so as Joe would say we go through the trident of simulation, data, theory). The final we just took was somewhat brutal –– it incorporates the second half of the course which is much more a bunch of different statistical techniques that we do not spend as much time developing (vs the first part which seems much more connected &#x2F; understood in depth), so make sure to keep on top of course material later in the semester!

If you enjoyed STAT 110 and would like to learn more about statistical methods, would highly recommend, although it is a good amount of work, and I found it certainly a lot more challenging than STAT 110.

But you can pick up the necessary concepts on the go throughout the semester and you will realize which concepts are recurrent (conditionals, Adam, Eve, LLN, CLT, and most importantly all the different distributions and their relationship with each other). Although it is pretty manageable, I would highly recommend taking stat 110 beforehand. To be clear, I do not recommend taking stat 111 without stat 110 unless you absolutely have to. If so, go through the textbook, do the exercises, do the midterms and finals, and make sure you score &gt;90 in the 110 practice finals if you ever decide to take 111 without 110.<br/><br/>The course is also not really pedagogical, at least to me, in the sense that the structure does not let me learn as effectively as I could. I would recommend going to sections where the TFs cover the essentials of what you need to know. Then watch the lectures on 2X speed. Joe is a very enthusiastic and entertaining lecturer, and his lectures can be a good review of what you learn in the sections. The textbook is very theoretical and you might not need it unless you are curious about the proofs.<br/><br/>Absolutely try to spend time on your own doing the psets before consulting OH or your friends. Most of my consolidation of 111 knowledge comes from doing them.<br/><br/>Make sure to be able to explain everything on the Exam handouts (Joe will post these a couple of weeks before the exams).

I would totally recommend stat111 over ec1126 (I have not taken ec1126 but from things I have heard). If you genuinely like math&#x2F;stats better than econ, I feel like it is a no&ndash;brainer</td>

It is indeed a continuation of the structure and style of teaching of 110, but moving towards statistics (where you have data) and away from probability. The content is hard in its own way, and you need to stay on top of everything. Be prepared to take many derivatives and go into the math of estimation in depth. This course is not nearly as applied as data science&ndash;y courses here, so take this if you&#x27;re genuinely interested in the statistical details of inference. It&#x27;s hard, and requires mathematical maturity, so be warned.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_17c43a8b-570c-4c4f-a513-55bec11d2829">Stat111 is a difficult course. I took stat110 the year before, and that definitely made it difficult to fully engage with the material because it relies so heavily on the details (like everything in that class is fair game and needed to derive or understand the material in 111). While it’s interesting to see the theory and real world intersect in this class, other classes like cs181 may be a better fit for you; the intensely theory heavy aspect of this class limits its applicability and makes much of the material you learn feel somewhat disconnected. Only take this course if you need it or have a burning desire to understand the theory. Joe is great as usual but he can only do so much to make the hard topics accessible to students. Keep in mind that TF resources are significantly limited in comparison to 110; don’t expect nearly as much help or availability in this class</td>

For me, 110 was harder but mostly because I didn&#x27;t go to lecture or read the textbook for 110 but I really showed up for 111. If you show up, do the work, attend &#x2F;watch lecture, go to section, do the PSETs (even if you get a lot of help from OH which i highly recommend), and study early for the exams, you WILL do well. It is simple. If you put in the work and you are committed to the class, you will be okay (might or might not get an A tbh, As are hard) but you will get through and get a lot out of the experience.</td>

What I would say is that this is not an easy class at all and you should be prepared to study a lot for it, both for the homework and the exams, especially for the exams. Start taking the practice exams early and make sure you know how to do all examples from class and homework.</td>

The weekly part of the course psets, etc just requires time but if you go to office hours and have people to check w, etc is really not too bad. The material felt more real world applicable to 110 than me although I thought the final felt pretty random&#x2F;harsh.</td>
