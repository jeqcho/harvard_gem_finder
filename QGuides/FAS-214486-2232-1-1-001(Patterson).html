The readings are rather scattered and essentially never discussed, so the actual content of the course is mostly confined to the lecture material. The lectures are sometimes interesting and Patterson himself has a lot of good insights, but usually the content is so watered down that you end up learning collections of summary statistics or very vague outlines of theoretical frameworks. This course shouldn&#x27;t really count for the ethics requirement; although one is likely to have moral intuitions about the material, the class merely gestures at different ethical views without ever talking about e.g. ethical frameworks, the full contents of arguments, or systematic ways to think about ethics. In many ways, this course is the apotheosis of the new Harvard Gened system: easy, somewhat tedious, so overly broad and simplified that it teaches you very little. Patterson&#x27;s other courses are much better.</td>

For many sections, it was obvious that my TF had not put thought into what the section was about and would allocate 20 minutes for us to just sit in silence and &quot;do the readings.&quot; TF would also just not respond to emails. Midterm grades were not handed out until a month later, and everyone got very generic comments. It was very obvious that the head TF who graded mine did not read my response, because he copy and pasted comments that were not even applicable to my midterm — the same thing happened to many others in my section. The second half of the class was planned extremely poorly: we had a final essay due and then a final exam the next day. The explanation we received for the delay in midterm grading was that there was not enough teaching support. Given that, I thought it was ridiculous that we had a final essay and a final exam — how many people are actually going to get their papers read and graded fairly? It&#x27;s laughable that we are having our labor exploited in a class about labor exploitation. Overall, one of the worst classes I&#x27;ve taken at Harvard.

One thing that I think frustrated everybody, whether or not they attended lecture, was just the severe disorganization of the course, especially in the beginning. I think this partly wasn&#x27;t their fault, as 3&ndash;4x times the number of people in previous years enrolled this time around, so the teaching staff wasn&#x27;t prepared and hadn&#x27;t hired enough TFs to have enough sections for all those students. Because of this, section started quite late in the semester, but honestly I wasn&#x27;t complaining. Another point of disorganization came when it was time for the midterm. The head TF said the midterm would be posted&#x2F;available at a certain date, and it wasn&#x27;t. He made promises over email several times about when the grades of the midterm would be released, and failed every single one of those promises. Aside from all this, I really liked the rest of the course. It was really eye&ndash;opening in terms of recognizing the large amount of human trafficking that happens in every&ndash;day life. I also really liked how the final paper (if you&#x27;re not doing an engaged section) is pretty much self&ndash;directed, because it leaves a lot of creative direction to write about something you really care about. Once section started, I really liked it, especially since my TF made sure to reemphasize important notes from lecture and had us often debate or take certain sides of an issue, to help prepare us for the argumentative nature of the exams. There were usually only 3 people participating in these rather large sections, and that&#x27;s because a majority of people didn&#x27;t go to lecture. Over 400 people enrolled in this class and less than 40 would show up to lecture on a regular basis. Many people treated this class like the easy 4th or 5th class they didn&#x27;t have to pay attention to, and started regretting it towards the end when the grade on our 1 midterm was a bit low and they didn&#x27;t participate in section. Overall, just make sure to take notes at every lecture (keep a running document or something similar), participate in section, and go over the weekly study questions in the syllabus to help prepare for exams.</td>

However, the midterm and final are a weird essay format, writing essentially two essays in 100 minutes. This is fine but the guidelines are kinda wonky, the feedback from TF is minimal, and the grading seemed overly harsh. The final exam is an 8&ndash;10 page paper in which the teaching team tries to reinvent the argumentative essay, so also a bit wonky.  I learned a lot from this class but in all honesty, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone who isn&#x27;t passionate about the topic because getting an A is extremely uncertain.</td>

ONLY TAKE IT PASS&#x2F;FAIL. On paper, the grading standards and assignments look straightforward: attend the lectures, do the readings, attend section, do 2 exams, and write a final paper. If you study hard and learn the material, you would think that your efforts are reflected in your grades. However, there is a very peculiar disrespect and disregard by the teaching staff towards the undergraduates taking the course. The incident which stands out the most is that, despite the course syllabus saying the course is graded on a scale of 0&ndash;100, the MAXIMUM grade you can actually receive in the course is a 93 if you take it with the Teaching Fellow “Sully.” Essentially, if you performed at the standard of 100 on the exam&ndash; an outstanding level and graded as 100 by any other member of Harvard faculty&ndash; you would still get a 93 input into canvas for this class. If you performed at a 98, you would still only get a 93; any grade from 100 to 93 was “graded” and input as a 93. Though the syllabus promises you fair grading, there is NO POSSIBLE WAY to get a 94 or above. I raised this this concern about the difference between the syllabus’ policy (0&ndash;100) compared to the policy our teaching fellow DIRECTLY ANNOUNCED in section (0&ndash;93) as coming from Dr. Patterson because he is “old school” to the teaching staff (though this gives away my identity, for reference Sully said this in his Tues 10:30 section); Dr. Bolger (Dr. Patterson’s head teaching fellow) expressed that it is unlikely for students to perform at a A level. While understandable, it didn’t address his teaching fellow’s comments in section that they refuse to evaluate students higher than a 93 at all, by policy, even if they deserve more than a 93 by any other normal Harvard professor&#x2F;teaching fellow&#x2F;instructor&#x27;s evaluation.<br/><br/>You might read this and think “wow, this person really wants an A” . I do not think all students should be assured an A overall for the class. I just think that students deserve to know how they are evaluated ON ALL ASSIGNMENTS before signing up for the class, and I think those standards should stay consistent throughout the class. I think it is COMPLETELY ABSURD that there is a secret grading standard that was revealed in APRIL. None of my other classes so proudly announced that you, by class policy, are evaluated differently than what is stated on the syllabus. Hiding this information from students until the very end of the class and lying about the grading scale in the syllabus is disingenuous of the teaching staff. If you want to learn anything or build a connection with teaching staff who respect your intellectual curiosity and want to support your growth, CHOOSE A DIFFERENT COURSE.</td>

Several allegations from TFs confirmed this — some were only allowed to give students a 93 as a max score, even if they scored above this threshold. Giving students A&ndash;s when they deserved As is unfair, especially for students applying to postgraduate programs or those who need specific GPAs for employment opportunities.<br/><br/>Furthermore, TF Ben Bolger took 2 months to grade the midterm. When feedback was given, it was the same copy &amp; pasted feedback given to everyone. This is not indicative of a proper learning environment in which one TF holds up grading for so many students for a huge portion of the semester. This is particularly complicated when there were previous allegations that the grading would not correctly correspond to the effort students put into class. <br/><br/>Finally, there are many issues with TF Ben Bolger. Ben Bolger, who infamously is a “perpetual student” with 17(?) degrees, went on many power trips to students, aggressively responding on emails and taking points away for a file misname. In his sections, Bolger incessantly defended pedophilia, child pornography, rape, Donald Trump, and slavery. The defense of these topics, especially as a rich white straight man with structural power, is not indicative of a good, content&ndash;sensitive TF that we needed for this course on human trafficking, slavery, and abolition. <br/><br/>Ben Bolger also repeatedly crosses inappropriate lines with female students. He incessantly wants female students to go to office hours and gives his personal number out. In a course about this topic which emphasizes a sense of urgency for individuals acting in a suspicious manner, I do not believe this TF is suitable. He is even adding negatively to the class environment by making women uncomfortable in his presence with his defense of topics that disproportionately affect women yet simultaneously attempting to fraternize with students.<br/><br/>I would suggest that you not take this class as a female student. Not only do TFs like Ben Bolger completely undermine the realities of misogyny for women, but they perpetuate it through insensitive comments and remarks. Stay clear!!</td>

I generally think the gened system is stupid, it&#x27;s fine to get breadth but few geneds achieve any memorable breadth, but this one actually does. Most geneds are just like &quot;Subject 100&quot; style classes anyways, maybe they&#x27;re slightly more focused or interdisciplinary, but this is actually a broad course (in terms of disciplines) but deep (in terms of very non&ndash;introductory in any discipline). It isn&#x27;t inaccessible if you don&#x27;t have some prior policy, philosophy, sociology, etc. background, but if you do then you can see how your field intersects with its neighbors.<br/><br/>In less abstract abstract terms:<br/>&ndash; You get to choose your own level of engagement of the material.<br/>&ndash; Workload very easy, grading a bit tough. As someone who took the class wanting a light workload, was indifferent about grading, and wanted to see a gened that actually was a bit &quot;real world&quot;, it was perfect for me.<br/>&ndash; Lots of classes at harvard will have the &quot;only chance to learn from a big name&quot; feel to them, but this class also has many guest lectures that are highly esteemed and can give a non&ndash;academic feel to the course. These guest lectures felt like an author event or similar oftentimes, rather than a lecture.<br/><br/>So take this if you have some desire to be in a gened that isn&#x27;t just a freshman level course in some random subject.</td>

Importantly, it also teaches us what&#x27;s being done to address these issues an how we can help. However, although the intention behind this course is noble, I and many other students have had some qualms with its execution. Firstly, it took an extremely long time to receive feedback on the midterms &ndash; around a month, despite promises that it would take much less time. Grading could at times be harsh and arbitrary. There are rumors circulating that TFs were instructed to grade harshly because of the professor&#x27;s own dislike of grade inflation, though it more so seems that the result was grade deflation, with points being subtracted just for the sake of doing so. Assignment requirements were also sometimes unclear &ndash; at times were were both asked to provide more facts and fewer facts, relative to more subjective discussions. Section could also be a bit bland and unproductive because it was too unstructured &ndash; often no one talked because the questions we were asked to discuss were generic and unable to leave much room for nuance. One could also argue that the course staff could at times be rather reluctant to accommodate students with legitimate special needs, leaving them to feel at times neglected.</td>

Here are the pros and cons of the course:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>&ndash; Material is very interesting and important. Human trafficking and modern slavery are huge problems and this course will open your eyes to how much our world tolerates the abuse and destruction of millions of lives. It made me recognize how fortunate I am to not have to work 20 hours per day in forced labor to be paid little to nothing and be subject to tortuous abuse. I am very grateful for my lot in life and am motivated to help others improve their lot in life due to this course.<br/>&ndash; Professor Patterson is a really cool dude, is an expert on the subject, and is a fun and engaging lecturer.<br/>&ndash; I had a great TF who led an engaging section.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>&ndash; Course structure was a total mess.<br/>&ndash; The staff took almost a month to get our midterm grades back to us because the course didn&#x27;t hire enough TFs to grade it.<br/>&ndash; Midterm grades were distributed semi at&ndash;random with the goal of having a B+ average across the course so that it doesn&#x27;t seem like a gem. Some students were given copy&ndash;pasted comments on their midterms but different grades. Totally unacceptable and unfair grading practice, especially considering this was a course about fairness and justice.<br/>&ndash; Midterm and final were nightmares. We were asked to write research papers, cited, in the span of 100 minutes. Grading harshness varied entirely by TF and there was no rubric or consistent standard of grading.<br/>&ndash; The head TF, Ben Bolger, was problematic , making inappropriate comments and refusing to give students extensions even when they had valid excuses.<br/>&ndash; Lecture slides were not posted on canvas and Prof speeds through lecture without giving enough time for notes. Lecture slides were disorganized and there was no course textbook.<br/>&ndash; Prof is tenured and it seems like he&#x27;s checked out from being involved with student interaction.<br/><br/>Overall, I would not take it again.

I was not in his section (thank god!), but I heard from others about his countless inappropriate comments and jokes that included subjects like CSA. Unfortunately, I still experienced Ben&#x27;s nasty attitude through email, as many have in the course, and simply asking for an extension because of my mental health issues led to Ben sending a degrading response. Of course, I did not mind getting rejected for my extension request, but I could have done without receiving a nasty email response that caused me to tear up in the library.

Patterson is an amazing professor (and is also incredibly famous). He loves teaching and loves his students. The topic is also so important so I&#x27;m glad he was able to teach so many students this year. <br/>The only bad thing about the course is that the head TF, Ben, made a lot of our experiences miserable. His emails to students were very harsh and unprofessional. He didn&#x27;t provide the TFs with much support so the section component suffered in that way. He&#x27;s an uncomfortable person to speak with so I would recommend not joining his section (which is unfortunately the engaged section). Hopefully he won&#x27;t be the head TF again next year because the course itself is pretty strong but he made the overall student experience kinda bad.. <br/>Overall, knowing how bad the head TF is, I would still take this course because I learned a lot and enjoyed Patterson&#x27;s lecture. (He&#x27;s also retiring soon so take it before he leaves!)</td>

The engaged section is definitely great since it gives you an opportunity to work on a project instead of doing a final paper thought not everyone is able to be in the engaged section.

The drawback to this course is that communication from the teaching staff is often poor and grading can be inconsistent, but if you create a good relationship with you section leader and are willing to put the work in then navigating the course is doable.

We didn&#x27;t receive feedback on the midterm until a month later, which meant that we had no idea how we were doing in the class until mid&ndash;April. And it took 5 weeks (and many passive aggressive emails from Dr. Ben) before I finally got a section assignment for this class. I think that they just could not handle the huge number of students in the class. Professor Patterson is a fine lecturer but he puts way too many words on his slides and doesn&#x27;t share them with the class. This meant that I was rushing to take down notes. Also, the course attempts to cover too many topics &ndash;&ndash; and thus does them all poorly &ndash;&ndash; instead of focusing in on a few key areas. I know that Professor Patterson is an expert in the field, but this class felt like the cliff notes version of a hundred different things. Overall the class was a huge disappointment.</td>

If you are looking for a great Harvard academic experience, this is probably not your best option. There are certainly interesting things to learn in this class, and the section debates can be very interesting, but overall it is not particularly stimulating or enlightening. There is a Midterm, Final, and a Final Paper (in addition to section participation). The only time this class has a significant amount of work is when reading period approaches, as the Final Paper is due the day before the Final.</td>

Professor Patterson is not a great lecturer, he usually reads off the slides and you can barely hear what he is saying. He also does not share the slides, but the class is recorded. As the semester goes on, you see less and less people in the lecture hall and to be honest,  going to lecture is not really necessary if you have a good section component. Unless you are passionate about the topic, I suggest looking into another course. If you are looking for a gem, this is definitely it. My section (fortunately) was great, the conversations, topics and discussions helped cover and summarize what was said in class. Looking back at this class, it helped me have a breathing room from harder courses but I would have liked to maybe try another class instead. Take this with a grain of salt, try it out and if you don’t like it, take another course. Again, you get what you put in.</td>
