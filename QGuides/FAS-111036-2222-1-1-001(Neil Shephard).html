Workload isn&#x27;t too bad but you basically have to go to office hours to get the psets done. Also, high recommend going to sections &ndash; the TFs are great teachers and hearing the material a second time with the ability to ask questions is so useful, but sections are so underutilized!</td>

Feicheng is also very patient and knowledgeable. he helped a lot.<br/>2: exams this term were actually quite easy. median on the midterm was a 33&#x2F;36 and median on the final was a 62&#x2F;72.<br/>3: that said, the median course final grade would be around 94.5, assuming 0.4 taken for psets after dropping the two lowest and considering the easiest grading i have ever seen.<br/>4: the letter grade cutoffs were extremely low, A is a bit lower than 92.5, which means at least 60% of the class get an A?<br/>5: please take it. the course materials are very interesting.

You need a very strong background in STAT110 (to the point where you can use random results to solve a problem that can&#x27;t be solved any other way). You also need to be proficient in expectation&#x2F;variance algebra. The midterm and final are very hard for no reason, and the problem sets are usually unrelated busy work&#x2F;R coding. The topics are extremely interesting and useful, and I feel I did learn a lot, but most of it was through my own learning. The course notes&#x2F;pseudo textbook was decent, but not nearly the same level of STAT110. If it had a textbook like STAT110 the course would be 10x better. The concepts just really did not click until I worked things out on my own. Lectures were long and much more conceptual than what was needed to actually understand the material (I stopped going after the first 3 weeks). There was also a sufficient lack of practice problems, which was quite annoying. Overall, while I ended up doing well and I learned a lot, the course has a lot to improve, especially with how stressful and difficult the material can be in relation to the midterms and finals (which seemed to test your random math abilities more than statistical inference or knowledge of the material).</td>

Also beware that this class requires many hours a week, which might not be feasible for all graduate students. Including lecture, section and office hours, I spent about 20 hours a week on the class. I found reading the lecture notes after watching the lecture on panopto (or going in person) worked best for reinforcing the material but I did not find the sections as helpful. I found some other graduate students to go over the homework with, which was very helpful for my learning! I can highly recommend finding a study group.

It depends on the person, however. I found the content a bit more dry in this course, and I therefore had a bit more difficulty wrapping my mind around certain concepts. I think reading the textbook early in the week definitely helps with comprehending lectures and completing psets, so I definitely recommend using it extensively if you want to take this class!</td>

I didn&#x27;t dislike 110, in fact, I really enjoyed it, but I felt like there was something missing. Stat 111 was the missing piece and made taking 110 completely worth it. This course is similarly structured super well like Stat 110, with organized lectures, tons of great sections, office hours, wonderful TFs, a GREAT textbook that&#x27;s only getting better, and assignments that neither feel too tedious nor too easy. Felt like the right level of difficulty, which is definitely REALLY hard, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but I think if you put the time and energy into this course you can definitely succeed. It&#x27;s not a weed&ndash;out class like CS 124, nor is it an easy&ndash;ish intro class like CS 50. This class is the real deal, but it&#x27;s definitely worth taking. I think statistics is perhaps the single most useful quantitative subject to learn as it applied to EVERYTHING and really changes how you think about the world, like for real. Also, I thought Neil was a great professor. Definitely a slow lecturer, but he is SO nice, super communicative, and listens to students&#x27; concerns, and adjusts the course on the fly accordingly. <br/><br/>I wanted to drop the course after the first week because I thought it would be too hard, but was convinced to stay in it, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. First three weeks (outside of the midterm and final, which were hard but very reasonable tbh) were definitely the most difficult, but then it stays at a constant difficulty level. Second half of the course is also even more interesting than the first, so stick with it! Also, don&#x27;t be scared of the R portion of the class, it&#x27;s really not that bad—lowkey the R questions were the easiest and most fun, I really looked forward to them by the end.<br/><br/>TLDR: take this course, it&#x27;s sick, go to section, go to OH, read the textbook, and ball tf out. You got this champ</td>

I did well in Stat 110 with the help of an amazing ARC tutor and a lot of time + effort, ended up scoring around 91&ndash;95 on the two exams, and I had taken it the fall semester before taking Stat 111. Yet, I still had a pretty hard time with stat 111. I had seen past q guide reviews recommend reviewing all of stat 110, and I wanted to but didn&#x27;t end up following through with those plans. I would strongly strongly recommend that if there is anything in 110 you are uncomfortable with to review it intensely before stat 111. There are so many things that come with familiarity with the distributions, conditional expectation + variance, properties of expectation&#x2F;variance&#x2F;covariance, bayes, and CDF&#x2F;PDFs. <br/><br/>I would recommend not skipping lecture LOL and trying to keep up with the lecture notes. I ended up skipping lecture but watching Joe&#x2F;Neil&#x27;s 2021 videos from the Zoom era, and I found those to be extremely helpful! Definitely do as much practice as you can before the exams + being familiar with where everything is in the textbook is key. I think resourcefulness or being able to quickly identify where things are explained&#x2F;explored in the textbook + past problems is probably the most helpful for the midterm&#x2F;final.<br/><br/>I think there are still a lot of things I don&#x27;t understand but while studying for the final, I did feel like things were starting to come together!</td>

First, Prof. Shepherd is being very serious when he recommends reading the Lecture Notes alongside completing the course material.  The lectures are great for establishing most of the necessary foundation for this course, but the Lecture Notes help immensely with filling in any gaps and discussing some things not covered in lecture.  Second, utilize office hours well, these will help immensely with problem sets as some questions can get quite tricky later in the semester.  Third, and most importantly, make sure you have a strong Stat 110 foundation AND have the Stat 110 textbook readily available before going into this course.  The content is referenced often and forms a good part of this course&#x27;s theoretical foundation, and without solid Stat 110 knowledge Stat 111 will be much harder than it has to be for you.</td>

Here are the ways in which I was wrong:<br/><br/>1. Stat 111 is much, much more difficult than Stat 110. Just to give a couple of examples, the derivations behind some of the concepts we use are too complex to understand intuitively, and the steps to solve many of the problems require pretty intense algebra&#x2F;differentiation. I had to invest far more time into understanding the material in Stat 111 compared to Stat 110 and, even with more studying, did not understand everything by the midterm or the final. So, take it from someone who took Stat 110 and did extremely well: how well you understood Stat 110 material might not be how well you understand Stat 111 material.<br/><br/>2. Stat 111 is not as &quot;fun&quot; as Stat 110. In Stat 110, you got recognizable results that you could more readily map onto cool world examples or hypothetical situations, such as a deck of cards or a guessing game — in Stat 111, you learn about stuff that&#x27;s absolutely crucial to the field of statistical inference, such as the consistency of an estimator for a particular estimand, but stuff you probably will not find interesting or useful unless you plan to do statistical work.<br/><br/>3. Having said that, while Stat 111 is not as fun as Stat 110, it is much, much more practical. Stat 110 is fun for solving cool math problems but Stat 111 is for taking actionable steps to make a reasonable guess about something based on data, which you will be doing a lot of in a variety of fields.<br/><br/>Lastly — this is slightly tangential — I took Stat 110 in Fall 2020 and Stat 111 in Spring 2022, and the two semester gap made Stat 111 much more difficult. If you&#x27;re planning on taking Stat 111, I would strongly recommend taking it immediately following Stat 110 so the concepts are fresh.</td>
