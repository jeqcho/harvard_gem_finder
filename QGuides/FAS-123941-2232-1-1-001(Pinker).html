Pinker presents ideas that are well described and sometimes controversial&#x2F;speculative, all of which sparked critical thought nevertheless. The combined workload with the readings, mini essays, and paper was quite heavy. The midterm was extremely challenging as it tested for specific details while we were expected to study for almost 10 chapters. It is worth noting that everything in this class is graded on a curve, and exams only contain lecture content (so attendance is crucial). <br/><br/>On a day to day basis, the lectures are very fun to watch but not as interactive as some other courses. You have opportunities to earn extra credit by writing papers connecting topics to the real world, which is very rewarding. My experience in this class was greatly enhanced by taking it with friends with whom I&#x27;d discuss the concepts, and I would recommend anyone else to do the same. I am extremely glad I took this class, but I also feel like I deserve an &quot;I survived Psych 1&quot; t shirt.</td>

I would disagree on that statement (coming from someone who went to 4&ndash;5 max), but they are certainly entertaining and Professor Pinker makes them enjoyable and worthwhile, so try to go at least to hear from an accomplished prof.

Do not expect any flexibility from the course staff regarding mental health concerns that may affect your ability to complete work. The teaching staff is incredibly ableist, as they require students to request extensions at least 48 hours in advance. So if you happen to have a flare&ndash;up (panic attack, depressive episode, asthma attack, etc.) two hours before an assignment is due, and you request an extension too late and fail to submit the assignment, you will earn a zero &ndash;&ndash; no questions asked. This will tank your grade tremendously. Additionally, Professor Pinker makes oddly inappropriate, overly sexual commentary when discussing certain psychological concepts like attraction, sex, and Freud&#x27;s psychosexual theories. For proof, ask any other Psych professors at Harvard or former teaching assistants for him. Or, do a simple search on Google. Expect to study concepts that aren&#x27;t even remotely related to psychology, just because Pinker wants to overwhelm his students with random information. My TF (majored in Psych undergrad, now a grad student studying Psych at the Ed school) even stated that if this was her intro Psych course, she would not have majored in Psych. I strongly suggest taking this course with a different professor and teaching staff or not taking it at all.</td>

This is a class that can really sneak up on you if you don&#x27;t keep up, especially given that lectures may span multiple chapters and are usually 60 or more slides. I ended up making flashcards for myself to aid in studying which really helped. Also, make sure when preparing for tests that you actually know how to apply material to new situations and that it isn&#x27;t just memorization.

This course needs a million things that it needs to improve on. For starters Steven Pinker is the WORST professor I have ever had in my time at Harvard. He is a racist, sexist, and extremely misogynistic man. Multiple times in class he said things such as &quot;women are less likely to perform well in STEM because it is not in their genetics&quot; which is completely untrue because it has been proven that Pinker cherry picks his data. He is extremely elisit and does not realize that everyone is not coming from the same background. He would often say things in class like &quot;this is the easy version which Harvard students like yourself do not need&quot;,  he grades things extremely late, and his exams are all about tricking students. He does not care to see his students succeed, he wants you to have to lose your sanity in order to achieve a good grade and even then you basically has to kiss his ass. Furthermore, Pinker needs to improve on the way he splits the grading of a course up the fact that he makes a final exam weigh more than the entire workload of the course and on top of that had to curve the midterm exam 40 points because of how poorly everyone did due to his NEED to keep wanting to trick students. Certain TF&#x27;s will treat you like you&#x27;re student just for asking questions and not knowing something. Also he would literally cover 60&ndash;100 slides for class and then preach that humans are not cable of taking in that much information. So please explain  to me how you do not practice what you preach. Not to mention he literally thinks the world revolves around him and most of the material taught will be taught through research he has done, books he has written, and studies he has been a part of.  As someone who wants to major in psychology I truly cannot believe that this man was the introduction to the subject. Had it not been for me being in another course that revolved around psychology I would not be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel and realize that Pinker is just a terrible professor. He does not care about the midterm feedback that you give him he will literally just make excuses and act like he is perfect, which he truly does believe. I read every page of the textbook, was at every lecture, and even watched previous lectures (which he copies btw), and still could not truly understand what the hell Pinker was trying to teach me.  He teaches this course as if you were a neuro science major and not a psychology major. He whines about how no one goes to office hours and then when you go will literally not help you. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE!! SAVE YOURSELFF!!! The people in the Q who are kissing his ass and saying he is great are usually white cis gendered men who love his gabs at people of color and women. I am telling you I have straight A&#x27;s at Harvard and normally NEVER complain about professors, I will NEVER take a class with Steven Pinker again.</td>

Some of the weeks had particularly interesting content too (illusions, 3D, Emotions lectures), and Pinker does a great job with making lectures engaging with class wide activities.

The likelihood is that as a college student you will not be able to provide with having to balance 3 or 4 other courses.  The course material is interesting, but Pinker does not really teach a just normal psych class.</td>

I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to be too bad because I already had a bit of a Psychology background, but I was completely wrong. It was actually one of my hardest classes and the class that gave me the most stress over the semester. You can find Steven Pinker&#x27;s lectures online and he says the same things in lectures that he did now and lectures that he&#x27;s done in previous years, it&#x27;s all very memorized and doesn&#x27;t seem that genuine. I would recommend taking Psych 1 in another semester and with a different professor.</td>

The study questions were helpful, especially preparing them in advance before section.  Try to push to have some sort of practice exams for the midterm and final, especially for the multiple choice parts.</td>

This said the class was definitely harder than some of the upper level psych classes so if you can circumvent this class at all I would try. Pinker graded the class on a curve but also provided extra credit assignments that you should definitely do. Overall I think this class is a lot of work if you really want to get the A but it&#x27;s fun!</td>

At a certain point, the professor will just get up and start spouting ridiculous theories about evolutionary biology and human emotion without much proof or relevance to the real world. It&#x27;s like he&#x27;s reading out of a textbook from the 1980s. If you are a woman or a member of the LGBTQ community, prepare to be completely overlooked in the material. If you have a mental illness, prepare to be stereotyped.</td>

I found section to be particularly useful to talk about psych research and think more deeply about the concepts presented in lecture. The mini assignments and research paper also help you develop thinking skills around research. <br/>If you are premed wanting to take this class to prepare for MCAT, I would suggest self&ndash;studying psych for MCAT rather than taking this class. Lecture was not particularly engaging nor well taught and I had to self study most of the concepts taught in this class and I’ll have to self study more for the MCAT specific psych topics. Your time would be better spent taking a different class that interests you.</td>

It&#x27;s hard to get distracted during class. However, the lack of resources provided to help you do well in the course can be frustrating. When I reached the midterm, I had no idea how to study because there were no practice exams, practice questions with explanations, or anything to help me prepare. Throughout the semester, you will feel unsupported, and it almost seems like Pinker is trying to make it difficult for you to succeed in his class by gatekeeping information. Also, Pinker does not provide access to his lectures. To obtain the recordings, you must request them and provide an explanation.</td>

Also love and the things we hold as so meaningful are all evolutionary, we’re just not that special when it comes down to it. PLEASE take this class at Harvard if you have the chance, for all you hear Pinker is fantastic.</td>
